association rule to achieve similar success The Asanctuary near a school The key is that wild life priori algorithm attempts to derive from the data sanctuary and school are not associated but association rules of the form If Temple then Pond correlated It indicates the strength and direction of a where Temple and Pond stand for simple codes or text linear relationship between two random variables values items or the conjunction of codes and text That is in contrast denoting any relationship not values e.g if City=Chandigarh and State=Punjab necessarily linear then Risk=Low and Cleanliness=High here the logical conjunction before the then would be the City 5.1 Correlation Rule Approach and the logical conjunction following the then would Let us consider Map Image Datasets as observations be the State of the association rule For each dataset we need to calculate the Euclidean Distance and the chi square analysis values Therefore 4.2 Execution Steps we define Pass 1 Calculation of the Support Value Chi square method Observed Expected First we calculate the support value by scanning all 1 variables to determine the unique codes or text values Expected items found in the variables selected for the analysis Euclidian Distance=U\(\(x2 x1  y2 yl 2 In this initial pass the relative frequencies with which the individual codes or text values occur in each Let us take a sample data from the Figure 5 transaction will also be computed The probability that Sample A Lahore is a city in Pakistan a transaction contains a particular code or text value is f\(tag_id,x,y,RGB  CP031,230,60,00110011 called Support the Support value is also computed in Sample B Thar Desert in India consecutive passes through the data as the joint f\(tag_id,x,y,RGB DI023,87,120,1 1110000 probability relative frequency of co-occurrence of Testset asimageobject\(X,269,65,00110010 pairs triplets etc of codes or text values Using equation 1  2 we get the values stored in Pass 2 Calculation of the Confidence Value and Figure 6 So therefore we 0.12  a support value that is greater than some userdefined minimum support value Figure 6 Image Mining Database Build  a correlation value that is greater than some minimum correlation value will be retained The above image data set if analyzed with a bar chart we observe that the proposed approach works 5 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS effectively well for small and medium test set range PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS but fails to have impact when the range increases The basic idea behind correlation analysis iS that the beod3sapsprtste association rule does not capture many interesting dependencies among items for finding a wild life 2009 IEEE International Advance Computing Conference IACC 2009 1547 denote it being a city Correlation Value 5.2 Building Image Mining Database After the initial pass through the data all items with a For improved performance advantages of different support value less than some predefined minimum features can be combined Several points of same type support value will be remembered for subsequent represent different settings for the feature The passes through the data Specifically the conditional distances between the points indicate correlations of probabilities will be computed for all pairs of codes or features That is points that are close together stand text values that have support values greater than the highly correlated features and points farther away minimum support value This conditional probability denote features with different characteristics that an observation of image object that contains a Secondary information for average temperature  code or text value X also contains a code or text value population density are considered Y is called the Confidence Value In addition a Tag Id Avg Temp Population Euclidean Chicorrelation value for a pair of codes or text values X Density Value Square Y is computed for the support value for that pair 1001 370 190 12 V14ue divided by the square root of the product of the LA001 20C 00 3.6 0.34 support values for X and Y After the second pass D1023 49C 00 6 0.56 through the data those pairs of codes or text values CA033 24C 69 70 0.09 that have the following CP031 320 70 15 0.43  a confidence value that is greater than some user-defined minimum confidence value LA004 120 00 5 0.65 LA012 300C 00 20
