By comparing vehicles flow to Pedestrians flow on stairways, Pedestrians flow on the walkways to Pedestrians flow on stairways, the foreign related researches to this thesis research, the models of Pedestrians flow on stairways are suitable for transfer stations in some big cities in china. It will offer references and directions for improving capacity of stairways, strengthening management with Pedestrians flow and organizing effectively Pedestrians flow Keywords-pedestrians flow; metro transfer station; velocity density; modeling I   I NTRODUCTION  Recently, the constantly improving level of China's urbanization and the rapidly increasing urban population have brought great burthen to the traffic in city. So many researches about traffic problem are developed widely especially the researches about vehicles flow have been arrived many achievements. But the researches about Pedestrians flow is few, and these researches focus on 
Pedestrians flow on walkways and neglect Pedestrians flow on stairways, especially in Transfer Station, the researches is very important to organize traffic flow In other countries, some researchers have been studied the characteristics of pedestrians flow, in 1958 Hankin, in 1971 Fruin and in 1988 Ando analyzed the relations between density-velocity and density-flow rate by investigating to commuters on walkways. In 1969, Predtechen Skii&Milinskii studied on the characteristics of pedestrians flow under emergency conditions and normal conditions, and draw curves about density-velocity and density-flow II  T YPE S TYLE AND F ONTS T HE Q UALITATIVE A NALYSIS ON P EDESTRIANS F LOW ON S TAIRWAYS IN T RANSFORMATIONS S TATION  This investigates obtain 177 records of down-stairways pedestrian flow, among them, 123 of the Chifeng road station,22 of people's square station,32 of shanghai train station, the analysis mainly adopts the data of the Chifeng road station. It also obtains 452 observation data records of up-stairways pedestrian flow, among them, 431 of people's square station, and 21 of shanghai train station. According to the validity analysis of the date, we select 344 records among them to carry on the regulation analysis. The following figure shows the relation of the velocity and density in three investigates spot

                Figure 3  scatterplot about down-stairways flow rate ~ density relationship of Chifeng road, people's square, train stations               Figure 4  scatterplot about up-stairways flow rate ~ density relationship of Chifeng road, people's square, train stations From the Figure 1 we can see, when the density smaller than 0.334 p/m2, most of down-stairway velocity would decrease fleetly along with the density increasing. It says that the affection of the pedestrian velocity to the density is more obviously when observing down-stairways, especially in the initial stage that the density starts enlarge particularly but when the density is bigger than 0.334 p/m2, the velocity of down-stairways decreasing equably along with the density increasing, but the range is smaller than the level of walkways According to the calculation of the flow rate, density and velocity relation, we can get the relation of the flow rate and density, its scatter plot diagram is as follows: along with the increment of the pedestrian flows density, the up-stairways and down-stairways pedestrian flows velocity goes a gradual increment, but when the density increases to some degree, the up-stairways and down-stairways pedestrian flows velocity will appear a trend for descend, this number is the optimum density that the stairs pedestrian go through Under this density, the stairs has the biggest flows rate, and the biggest capacity i.e. According to two diagrams of top the optimum density of the down-stairways pedestrian is 2 1  25  2 m m   the optimum density of the upstairways pedestrian is 2 2  27  2 m m   we can see, the optimum density of the up-stairways and down-stairways is basically consistent, but generally speaking, the optimum density of down-stairways pedestrian is smaller than the upstairways pedestrian density, it’s mainly because density has more affection to the down-stairways pedestrian velocity  III  MODELS ON PEDESTRIANS FLOW ON STAIRWAYS  A  The model on density-velocity of pedestrian free flow on stairway According to the service level of pedestrian flow on stairway, when the density is under 2  5  0 m p for upstairs pedestrian flow or 2  4  0 m p for downstairs pedestrian flow, the pedestrian flow is free, that is to say, the pedestrian on stairway can walk in the light of their conventional velocity that subject to the motive, the physical condition, their age and so on In the following, the chart reflected the relation between the density and velocity of pedestrian free flow on stairway                                                                 Figure 5  Graph of the relationship between velocity and free density Free density is 4  0 0 5  0 0       or   stands for density\, the velocity of pedestrian flow on stairway is independent of the density 4  0 0 5  0 0           downstairs upstairs const V  The function shows that the density  can not change the velocity V some range. But the velocity distribution takes on a certain kind of rule by analyses to the specimens which may be test by the software of Mat lab, using the command of norm plot\(X\ Mat lab, the velocity is normal distribution Figure 6  the normal distribution probability of velocity on free density The figure of the normal distribution probability can evaluate whether many data come from normal distribution If they do, the figure in the normal distribution probability figure is a beeline. According to the figure 6, on stairway 705 


the velocity of pedestrians under free density possesses normal distribution. And the average value of velocity is s m  82  0 namely, the velocity of pedestrians on stairway is generally s m  82  0 when pedestrians aren’t affected by other pedestrians B  The model on density-velocity of pedestrian jam flow on stairway when density exceeding maximal density When the pedestrians on stairway are too many, this may bring jam and lead the pedestrians not to walk so 0  V   max    In the following, analyses to the max  will be stated Generally speaking, the horizontal projective area of a pedestrian is his occupational area in stairway. The value of average occupational area is various in many countries. In Germany, it is 2 19  0  12  0 m in Russia, the value is 0.14 2 m and 2 1862  0  1458  0 m in Austria. This area can hold only one pedestrian. When exceeding the value, the stairway will be jam and all pedestrians can’t walk. In china in term of some researchers’ investigation, the area is 2 16  0 4  0 4  0 m    So, the space occupation rate of pedestrians d  2 16  0 m    2 max  2  6 16  0 1 1 m p d      1  The relation between density and velocity of pedestrian jam flow on stairway   max     2  2  6 0 m p V     2 C  The model on density-velocity of pedestrian jam flow on stairway under others conditions According to the traffic flow theory that Green shields put forward    j f V V   1 3 Analogously, The equation about velocity V density   stairway is  2 1 a a V    4 Similarly by simulating with Matlab software, the curve can be gained, as following  Figure 7  the function relation between velocity and density on stairways The equation about velocity V density   upstairs pedestrians and downstairs pedestrians  85  0 0.16    upstairs V  86  0 0.14    downstairs V 5 By analogy, the equation as Upstairs j f V   0.16                            \(6 The velocity under free density 85  0   f V m/s          \(7 Jam density 2   4  5 16  0  86  0 m p j    8 In the same way, we can conclude    j V and   j  of downstairs pedestrians s m V j  86  0      2    12  6 14  0  86  0 m p j    9 To upstairs pedestrians 85  0 76  0    f V m/s            \(10 2   4  5 85  5 m p j    11 To downstairs pedestrians s m V j  86  0 93  0       2    12  6 82  5 m p j    12 On upstairs and downstairs pedestrians flow, we can find the data is consistent, so the equations can reflect the characteristics of pedestrians flow on stairway IV  THE VERIFICATION TO THE MODELS ON PEDESTRIAN FLOW ON STAIRWAY  A  The verification to the models about the relation of flow rate and density on pedestrian flow on stairway In order to verify the veracity of the functions, by using data fit software, many kinds of functions about   f  include simple equation, quadratic equation, cubic equation quadric equation and so on will be built, the curves of the equations as followed Figure 8  Figure 8 the curves of equations about the relation of flow rate and density by using dataFit software TABLE I   E XPLAINING ABOUT SOME PARAMETERS OF THE EQUATIONS  Rank Model StdError RSS R^2 Ra^2 1 Sixth order polynomial 0.10 1.01 0.84 0.84 2 a*x^5+b*x^4+c*x^3+d*x^2+e*x+f 0.10 1.01 0.90 0.85 3 a*x^4+b*x^3+c*x^2+d*x+e 0.10 1.01 0.95 0.85 4 a*x^3+b*x^2+c*x+d 0.08 1.01 0.93 0.85 5 a*x^2+b*x+c 0.05 1.02 0.96 0.85 6 a*x+b 0.10 1.44 0.96 0.85 706 


Analyzing the figure and the table above, the red curve quadratic equation is optimal, so it is reasonable that the thesis uses quadratic equation to reflect the relation between velocity and density of pedestrians flow on stairway B  Comparing the pedestrian flow on stairway to the pedestrian flow on walkways about the relation of flow rate and density As above, we analyze the function of   V and    f  on stairway, because of few researches on pedestrians on stairway, the analysis by comparing is impossible, but some researchers such as Fruin and Hankin have researched the pedestrians flow on walkways, so we can compare the pedestrian flow on stairway to the pedestrian flow on walkways about   V and   f   Figure 9  the curves of   V on stairway and on walkways  Figure 10  the curves of   f on stairway and on walkways Hankin in 1958, Fruin in 1971 and Ando in 1988 analyzed the relation between velocity and density, density and flow rate of pedestrians flow on walkways, when the density is small \(Hankin 2  25  0 0 m p     Fruin 2  25  0 0 m p    And 2  95  0 0 m p    the velocity changes very little when the density changes, which is identical with the analysis to pedestrians flow on stairway. On stairway, when 2  5  0 0 m p    the velocity doesn’t subject to the density and is normal distribution,  because of the different characteristics of stairway and walkways, the free densities of pedestrians flow on stairway and on walkways are different Hankin’s curve about   V reflected that the velocity will decrease rapidly with the density increasing if 2  3 95  0 m p    if 2  3 m p   the velocity will decrease gently with the density increasing. For lacking date, Fruit’s curve was not projected beyond 2  8  1 m p but 2  8  1 0 m p    the relation between the velocity and the density is linear and Ando’s curve is similar with Hankin’s curve. If the density is same, the velocities on walkways all are bigger than on stairway, which is very reasonable. Because on walkways the pedestrians can gain larger walking space than on stairway, the pedestrians subject to the steps on stairway, they can’t enlarge their step. in addition, in 1969 Predtechenskii & Milinskii studied on relations between   V and   f of  on walkways in emergency conditions and normal conditions. In emergency conditions, the velocity exceeded obviously the velocity in normal conditions, if 2  35  0 0 m p    the velocity is constant, about s m  6  1 if 2  5  4 35  0 m p    the change range of the velocity increases, if 2  5  4 m p    the velocity will decrease rapidly, and when 2  5  5 m p    0  v In normal conditions Predtechenskii & Milinskii curve is alike with the curve of this thesis, the value of velocity is approximately identical under the same density  V  S UMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  By investigating to passenger flows on stairways in Shanghai metro transfer station, large numbers of data have been gained, after analyzing these data, the thesis concluded some qualitative characteristics of Passenger Flows on Stairways in Shanghai Metro Transfer Station, and built the models on upstairs and downstairs passenger flows. It will offer references and directions for improving capacity of stairways, strengthening management with Pedestrians flow and organizing effectively Pedestrians flow  R EFERENCES  1  Fruin J,  "Pedestrian Planning and Design", Metropolitan Association of Urban Designers and Environmental Planners, New York 1971,pp12-18.J.

 Figure 8. SenTM Control Flow during Sensor Tag life cycle  Final stage of the control flow is- Action and Deactivation. When an alarm event occurs, separate alarm actions are taken depending on the types of the event. If alarm type is BatteryLow, tag Logging and Sensing is deactivated to save tag battery life and to protect loss of sensing information stored in the tag memory. Similar action is taken to save tag battery power, if sensing value exceeds threshold limit. In case of MemoryFull alarm, a check is necessary whether tag is in reader area or out of the reader area. Read and Reset sensing memory action is taken when tag is inside the reader interrogation zone. But, tag status bit is set or Beep/Flash-bit ON when tag is out of the reader zone, in order to provide reliable system services D  3-Layer SenTM Architecture Fig. 9 shows the detailed block diagram of SenTM architecture for efficient sensor tag management. It is a 3layer architecture: \(1\apture Layer, \(2\ervice Layer and 3\pplication Layer. Capture Layer receives integrated RFID-Sensing data from active sensor tag, Application Layer provides necessary API\(s\ the user, while Service Layer provides all the services required for efficient sensor tag management SenTM Capture Layer is the bottom layer of SenTM architecture. It provides common reader interface for both active and passive reader types. Active Reader Layer is used for capturing streaming RFID-Sensing data from active sensor tag while Passive Reader Layer is used to read passive RFID tag data. Captured event is dispatched by Message dispatcher and sent to the SenTM Service layer for further processing SenTM Service Layer is the core of SenTM Architecture This layer provides 4 types of services required by the application. These are: \(1\Tag Command and Control 2\ice and Data Management Services \(DDMS\, \(3\ent and Query Processing Services EQPS\d \(4\rage and Output Services \(DSOS Tag command and controlling is performed by TCCS TCCS consists of Command and Controller modules while DDMS consists of four management modules. The Active Reader and Tag manager modules used for device management and other two is used for data management EQPS has an Event Handler module that listens and detects events of several types and process that event accordingly The Report Generator, and Data Storage and Loggers together form DSOS service module. SensorDB stores sensing data while Report Generator module provides the sensing report in accordance with the query registered by the user  Internet / Intranet Figure 9. 3-Layer SenTM Architecture

SenTM Application Layer is the top layer of SenTM architecture which provides four API\(s\he users Command and Query is sent by using Tag Configuration API and Sensing Query API. The other two API\(s\sed for synchronous and asynchronous sensing reporting to the user. Sensing Data Report API is used to send synchronous reporting for user query and Sensing Alarm Notification API sends alarm notification to the user asynchronously if any alarm event occurs E  Challenges in SenTM  Implementation High performance is one of the major system challenges in SenTM implementation. Detection and generation of alarm notification for tag health and status \(BatteryLow MemoryFull, Sensing threshold etc.\ well as a quick response to user queries are the key requirements of SenTM implementation. Also, application deploying a number sensor tags, generate huge amount of RFID-sensing information which is a scalability issue. Furthermore system performance degrades with the number of users and applications connected to the system. Our designed SenTM architecture uses Continuous Query \(CQ\ Processor and Event Handler module to resolve these issues V  C ONCLUSION  Active RFID tag integrated with sensing module can serve as active sensor tag. The advantage of using active sensor tag is that it provides greater communication range, long battery life and fastest tag data collection. However, sensor tag differs from active tag in several ways, because it continuously senses and stores sensing values in its tag memory. Each sensing value in a tag, costs battery power as well as memory space. Moreover, a sensor tag life cycle has different moods and states. It is necessary to switch tag moods and states depending on the situation that helps store tag battery power as well as sensing data. To control tag and to provide efficient system services, a management system is required. Although, ISO provides standard for active tag communication, it is insufficient to provide all the services required by sensor tag application. In this paper, we analyze the sensor tag applications and existing global standards to extract requirements and necessary features for efficient sensor tag management. Our proposed Sensor Tag Management \(SenTM\itecture is based on EPCglobal Standard Architecture Framework and ISO/IEC 18000-7 active air interface standard that provides compatibility and global interoperability of the system. We proposed four types of core management modules which are namely: Tag Command and Control Services \(TCCS\ice and Data Management Services \(DDMS\, Event and Query Processing Services \(EQPS\d Data Storage and Output Services \(DSOS\we only consider about tag device and tag data management but our tag management does not consider about sensor tag locations. Our future research work lies on providing integrated RFID-Sensing-Location management services using existing standards A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by the Grant of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology \(The Regional Core Research Program/Institute of Logistics Information Technology R EFERENCES  1  M its ug i,T  I n aba,L  T h e o do ro u,T  S   L o pe z  D  kim  D  M c F a r l ance H   Hada,Y.

  7  Figure 4 compares drive time blue line\ run time \(red line\for K10 Red.  On June 9, drive time and run time are nearly equal, indicating that the robot was driving during most of the duty period as expected.  On June 10 and 11 however, the drive time is significantly less than the run time, indicating that the robot was stationary roughly half the time it was running.  This mismatch can indicate performance problems, either due to increased robot down time or robot wait time between plans.  An inspection of events during these days indicates the robot did experience problems on both days.  On June 10, communication difficulties and low lighting resulted in reduced rover performance.  The wait time between plans was between 30 and 50 minutes, which is much longer than on June 9.  On June 11 the rover base controller had problems and the site terrain impacted traversability, both of which impacted the rover's ability to complete plans in a timely manner Figure 5 compares distance trav eled by the K10 Red rover to the planned distance.  An inspection of this figure indicates a limitation in using accumulated total distance as a metric.  By the end of the test, K10 Red had traveled 2375 meters, which agrees well with the planned distance of 2235 meters.  A comparison of planned distance to distance traveled for each duty cycle, how ever, reveals that the rover traveled further than planned on June 9, which masked the fact that the rover traveled less than planned on June 10  Figure 5. K10 Red Distance at Moses Lake There were significant problems with the quality of data communication to JSC for remote science operations on June 10 and 11, indicated by the high data gap count on these days. On June 10, there were 54 gaps ranging from 10 seconds to 53.5 minutes and on June 11 there were 65 gaps ranging form 10 seconds to 54 minutes. The reduced data quality affected the accuracy of the performance metrics computed remotely for K10 Red on these days K10 Black Performance K10 Black performed systematic site surveys in support of simulated science operations on June 12. A typical site survey performed by K10 Black consisted of navigating through a sequence of waypoints while taking GPR readings continuously. Often microscopic images were taken at waypoints as well. During the day of survey operations at Moses Lake Sand Dunes, the K10 Black robot was powered up for 5.67 hrs \(Run Time\and drove for .64 hrs \(Drive Time\or 11.3% of the time it was powered up Figure 6\Drive Time was lower than expected due a combination of GPR hardware problems and navigation problems due to inaccurate odometry in the sand at the survey site. K10 Black attempted to execute four science plans for a total planned distance of 776 meters \(Planned Distance\ actually traveled a total of 838 meters Completed Distance\ perform these survey activities Figure 7  Figure 6. K10 Black Operating Time at Moses Lake  Figure 7. K10 Black Distance at Moses Lake 


  8 The quality of data communication to JSC for remote science operations on June 12 was much better than that on the two days prior. There were a total of 5 gaps, ranging from 10 seconds to 30.75 minutes. These data gaps did not have a significant effect on th e accuracy of the performance metrics computed remotely for K10 Black 5  D ISCUSSION  The Role of Context Understanding the intent of rover activities provides an important basis for grounding the computation and interpretation of performance metrics. In particular, we assert that metrics, whether us ed for real-time monitoring or post-processed analysis, can only be interpreted in context  i.e., with respect to expect ations of performance for a particular task, activity plan, robot mode of operation, etc For example, the computation of Percentage Distance Complete \(ratio of Completed Distance to Planned Distance\requires constraining the computation of Completed Distance to be performed only while K10\222s plan is executing and to be reset to zero when a new plan is uplinked. Similarly the computation of metrics during autonomous operations should be distinguishable from metrics during teleoperation because expected performance can be quite different in these different control modes Finally, the computation of metrics during anomalous operations should be separa ble from nominal operations The rover may be successful at recovering from a problem while doing less well at achieving nominal mission objectives. In some cases, a me tric needs to be computed concurrently in more than one context For example, it is useful to accumulate Comple ted Distance for each plan distance traveled within a pl an\entire mission \(total distance traveled Another example is that the accuracy of real-time performance computations de pends upon the quality of the communication with the robot. We used the Data Gap Count as an indicator of communication quality during the field test at Moses Lake. While useful, this count does not represent information about the duration of communication problems. Based on our experience at Moses Lake Sand Dunes, we have identified a new metric for communication quality. We propose to compute the percentage of the duty period without data from the robot \(called Percentage Time in Data Gap\ as a measure of the quality of metrics, since a high percentage would indicate lossy communication and reduced confidence in the com puted values of performance metrics Real-time Displays During the test we identified and implemented a number of new features for the dashboard displays in response to operational needs. These feature include \(1\a user-initiated snapshot of all computed values we later expect to add the ability to restore the state of the computation engine to this checkpoint state, \(2\ogging of time-stamped user comments \(called user events pect to display user events in the timeline disp lay, and \(3\o the value of constants in the dashboard displays without restarting the computations. We also added new dashboard displays of rover data during the test. These displays provide information about the rover that aids in understanding performance \(i.e., execution status of planned tasks, robot subsystem status\add these new displays indicates the flexibility and extensibility of our architecture for performance monitoring Duty Periods During the HRS field test at Moses Lake Sand Dunes, we computed metrics whenever data were being transmitted from the rover. We did this to ensure that metrics reflected all rover activities. We expected that the value of metrics at the end of each day would then provide a summary of the day\222s activities. This resulted, however, in the computation of metrics during time periods when the rover was not intended to be operating \(e.g lunch periods, waiting for a demo, etc\e-based metrics such as Run Time and Drive Time were computed at times when the rover was not intended to be powered up or moving. This resulted in inflated Run Times \(see Figures 4 and 7\and artificially reduced the ratio of Drive Time to Run Time We believe a more realistic assessment of performance should constrain the computation of metrics to time periods when the rover is intended to be performing tasks. We define a concept called a duty period that corresponds to a contiguous interval of operations \(such as from rover startup in the morning until a planned ground control break period\We propose to compute accumulated metrics only during duty periods in future tests Technology Deployment at NASA The evaluation of our performance monitoring software during robotic field tests has provided useful feedback on the utility of the proposed metric s.  In particular we have gained valuable experience in using such metrics when data are subject to periodic dropouts We recently evaluated the use of our performance metrics during an analog test of rover reconnaissance as a precursor to planning astronaut EVAs where we got feedback a bout the utility of metrics for flight operations.  There is remaining work, however, before this technology can be operationally deployed A variety of data types are used by the real-time performance monitoring of robots.  These data types have correlates in current NASA operations, including spacecraft telemetry, Comps \(combinations of raw telemetry\anning information, and flight rules.  Deployment of performance 


  9 monitoring technology in flight operations will require that such information be captured electronically and made available for computer-based reasoning.  Recent efforts to move flight products like Sp ace Station activity plans and attitude timelines into XML supports this objective and future programs are investigating standards for representing such information, but current NASA programs have not yet achieved the level of information integration that will be needed to automate performan ce monitoring as described in this paper The availability of real-time performance data raises the possibility of using this data to adjust operations for improved performance.  Such real-time performance management has become a consideration for commercial plant operations as plant automation is introduced.  Often the barriers to real-time performance management are as much cultural as technical In a recent article \(Spiegel 2007\t was observed the adjustment of plant operations by the enterprise has met strong resistance due to mutual mistrust between plant operators and corporate Information Technology departments.  Such barriers are also a possibility when introduci ng real-time performance management into NASA operations 6  F UTURE W ORK  Assessing Performance Based on Expectations An important result from this test is an approach for improving the interpretation of performance metrics. Prior to the test, we established performance expectations from robot task plans \(called plan performance\Satisfactory performance was defined as the achievement of planned targets \(e.g., successful completion of planned tasks or collection of planned samples\ion of robot performance during the test made it clear there are other considerations in defining satisfactory performance The limits imposed by robotic hardware and software design define expectations about the robot\222s engineered performance. Engineered performance defines robot capabilities under ideal circum stances. Robot operations however, often occur under less than ideal circumstances which can constrain maximum speed and sensor accuracy The limits imposed by the environment in which the robot operates define expectati ons about robot operational performance. Engineered perform ance also can be degraded over the course of multiple missions due to normal component wear as well as systemic problems that reduce performance The limits imposed by component use and subsystem problems define the expectations about robot degraded mode performance. Robot operations can be further constrained by flight rules. Maximum robot speeds may be reduced when operating near other robots. Or, certain robot behaviors may be precluded when operating near humans The limits imposed by the flight rules established for a mission define expectations about safe performance Moreover, when comparing robot metrics over multiple duties periods or missions \(called historical performance\or comparing the performance of different robots, it is important to establish a basis of comparison that identifies which of these performance dimensions predominate and how these dimensions combine to establish performance expectations, such as: Did robotic hardware or software change between missions? And were the robots being compared operating under the similar operational constraints Summarizing Performance We are currently preparing to use our real-time performance monitoring software to support a test of science operations at NASA Ames Research Center in November 2008. Based on our experience at Moses Lake Sand Dunes, we have identified a few key metrics that should provide a high-level summary of rover performance. These metrics will be displayed on a summary Web page for operational use. We will summarize rover performance from the following three perspectives 200  Mission: metrics that describe the rover\222s contribution to the mission. The Work Efficiency shows the ratio of rover productive time to rover overhead time. When WEI exceeds 1.0, the rover is spending more time accomplishing mission objectives than performing other activities. The Percentage of Time on Task shows the ratio of rover productive time to total operating time 200  Science: metrics that describe the rover\222s performance with respect to the scie nce plan. The Percentage Distance Complete summarizes the percentage of the planned distance that has been traveled by the rover The Percentage of Tasks Complete describes the percentage of planned tasks successfully completed 200  Rover: metrics that describe the rover\222s health and status. We detect when personnel intervene in rover operations to handle anomalies, and we compute the Mean Time to Intervene a nd the Mean Time between Interventions We also plan to compute the Percentage Time in Data Gap as a measure of the quality of computed values, since a high percentage indicates lossy communication and a lower confidence in metrics To illustrate how we expect this information to summarize performance for mission managers, consider the following example based on data collected by K10 Red at Moses Lake on the afternoon of June 11, 2008. In this example, we 


  10 played back recorded data into our performance monitoring software and took a screen shot of the Ops Synopsis dashboard display partway through the run \(Figure 8 this situation, the rover is executing a science plan to perform reconnaissance of the Moses Lake Sand Dunes. At the time of the screen shot, the rover has spent 59% of its time on planned tasks for a WEI of 1.446. This indicates the mission is going reasonably well, since WEI is greater than 1.0 and the rover is spending the majority of its time on planned tasks. The science metrics indicate good progress is being made on data collection, requiring the rover to drive 326 meters to complete 70% of the plan. The rover metrics indicate minimal unintended human intervention, with MTBI \(00:39:10.7\gnificantly greater than MTTI 00:02:01.2\The Percentage Time in Data Gap is zero indicating that metrics are based on all available robot data and are thus considered reliable  Figure 8. Example of Summary Metrics for Mission Manager  7  C ONCLUSIONS  Our performance computation so ftware operated reliably for over 46 hours during a four-day period. Task performance metrics computed for the K10 robots during the field test include robot drive time, robot run time, and performance during plans \(e.g., percentage of planned distance completed, percentage of planned samples complete\We measured the number of times we lost signal from the robot at the simulated Mission Control as a measure of the quality of our real-time metrics. Based on these results, we conclude that our proposed approach for computing and displaying rover performance metrics in real-time is viable 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was funded under NASA\222s Small Business Innovative Research \(SBIR\ program, Topic X7.02 HumanSystem Interaction and supported by the NASA Exploration Systems Technology Development Program \(ETDP Human-Robotic Systems \(HRS\.

Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.
