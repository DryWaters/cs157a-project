Extraction of Primitive Motion and Discovery of Association Rules from Motion Data Takaki Mori and Kuniaki Uehara Department of Computer and Systems Engineering Kobe University Nada Kobe 657-8501 Japan E-mail mori uehara}@ai.cs.kobe-u.ac.jp Abstract In past several years human motion data is practi cally used in some domains such as SFX movies CGs and so on Motion data is captured by motion cap ture system 
which captures the position of sensors on body joints so we can get motion data as 3-0 time series data Since motion data is multi-stream data of time series for 17 body parts the amount of data is huge Furthermore motion data is expensive cre ators must pay much time and labor to get motion data Motion database can help those creators to pro duce motion data with less cost The database how ever requires content-based retrieval method because it is 
dificult to identify the motion by using keyword approach Consequently we will introduce association rules which represent dependency between body parts Association rules represent the motion of body parts and can be used as visual tags For example associ ation rule discovered from motion data about walking is when right arm is up left hand and left knee are down In this paper we will introduce Q method to discover dependency between body parts as association rules Association rules consist of symbols 
uniquely represent basic patterns We call basic patterns as primitive mo tions Primitive motions are extracted from motion data by using segmentation and clustering processes Finally we will discuss some experiments to discover association rules from multi-stream of motion data 1 Introduction In past several years, time series data became im portant in various applications It includes a sequence of real numbers which represent values at time points such as price of stocks weather patterns sales inde cators It is basically a series of 
one dimensional data and thus the existingt works until now have focused on indexing or seraching onedimensional sequences of data Z  Human However we treat human motion data motion data is a three dimensional data Thus the efficient retreival for voluminous and complex infor mation which is the intrinsic characteristic of human motion data is getting increasingly important On the other hand human motion has the following features body parts Motion is the combination of postures For 
exam ple we swing both arms to keep walking straight In this experiment stepping left foot forward causes swing of right arm We must pre-define the set of postures so as to represent the motions data  contents in the time flow There is tendency that certain movement likely to occurs after another movement For example once we raise our hands we probably put our hands down in certain interval of time But it is difficult to detect borders in consecutive 
move ments Human motion data has the above dependencies then it should be treated as multi-stream SI Find ing structure in multi-stream of data is an important problem That is, multi-stream includes unexpectedly frequent or infrequent co-occurrences among different streams This means that an event on one stream is related to other events on other streams which seem to be independent from the former event We call this dependency motion association rule However it is an expensive task to discover mo tion association rules because of the huge amount 
of the motion data Furthermore the number of streams of the motion data is large In order to find motion association rules and reduce the cost of the task we convert the high dimension multi-stream motion into sequences of symbols of lower dimension Each sym bol represents a basic content and motion data that can be expressed as the set of the primitive motions IEEE International Worksop on Robot and Human Interactive Communication 0-7803-7222-0/01/$10.0002001 IEEE  200  


It is necessary to clarify how we recognize motion to define primitive motions However there are some problems to find it To deal with these problems it is necessary to consider the following topics 1 Ambiguity of finding the borders between primi tive motions the definition of borders for move ment is unclear It is necessary to define borders in consecutive movement 2 Reconstructivity of motion by using primitive mo tions every motion is represented as the combi nation of primitive motion.\222 For example, \223taking 2 steps\224 and 223taking 20 steps\224 is composed by the same motion 223stepping\224 This means 223stepping\224 is the construction of primitive motions such as 223moving left foot forward\224 and 223moving right foot forward\224 In order to solve these problems we will introduce the segmentation method Segmenting means produc ing a piecewise approximation of the data i.e piece wise polynomial piecewise splines etc The tech nique for the segmentation of human motion data have received considerable attention if these patterns are planar 141 The goal of our research is to simplify the general shape of the motion data with a few perceptu ally significant breakpoints Generated segments will have semantics summarizations of human motion 2 Human motion data as multi-stream Qbwsbm\(md 5:nght-e 12 nght eitoa 1 223ppr tor I I mkh 13:l&Relh 2 nSht hip  l:neht&at 9 IrR Yp 9:imrouub 15.1.u-n 4 right knee 10 tight dodder 15 mk 5 le nee 11 I adder l brad Figure 1 Body parts used for the experiment The motion captured data have various information of the body parts This means that captured motion data can be represented by the 3 dimensional time series stream representing positions of major body joints Figure 1 shows the body parts used in motion capture system We can get data for the following body parts lower torso upper torso the root of neck head, roots of collar bones shoulders elbows wrists hips knees and ankles Moreover body parts have the tree structure as shown in Figure 1.We set the sampling rate to 120 timeslsec To get time series of 3-D motion data we use an optical motion capture system This system consists of six infra-red cameras 18 infra-red ray reflectors and a data processor The procedure to get time se ries of motion data is as follows The act,or puts 18 markers on the selected body joints and performs an action in the field of the installed cameras as shown Figure 2 The recorded actions are processed in order to calculate the SD locations of the reflecectors j%!TP=STP=\223  y  Figure 2 The motion capture system Figure 3 shows an example of the motion data which represents 223after one finished raising one\222s right hand one starts lowering the left hand\224 5 ight Rabing Lbe 223ght hand\224 aiaingthe ti 1-IAuW i Position of the right hqd Tme HiQht  221barering the ien hand\224 i 221\221loUeriog the Len hand\222 pw Position of the w le hand Time Figure 3 An example of correlation in multi-stream of human motion The example shows that the motion data has fea unfixed temporal interval between events on each stream Consistent contents on each stream do not always occur in fixed temporal interval For instance 223raising the right hand\224 and 223lowering the left hand\224 occur twice in each stream how ever temporal interval of occurrences between tures as multi-stream such as 201  


223raising the right hand\224 and 223lowering the left hand\224 are different T1  T2 To define the borders the huge amount of the mo tion data and the personal characteristics of the actor should be considered 3 Content-based automatic symboliza tion by using curve simplification Generally the human motion consists of 3 states occurrence transition and termination Occurrence represents a change of speed from zero to a posi tive value transition represents increase or decrease of the speed .and termination represents a change of the speed from a positive value to zero Thus each change in the speed of a body part can be considered as a breakpoint We will divide motion data into segments at those breakpoints where velocity changes Those detected breakpoints are candidates for segmentation For this reason the algorithm calculates the vari ance between all the candidate breakpoints However the variation of the curves for motion data between these breakpoints is small and include noise made by unconscious movement which is independent from oc currence of the changes of contents The unconscious movement is mainly caused by the vibration of the body parts Noisy breakpoints generate meaningless segments such as a too short time and tiny move ments Such segments need to be reduced because they include no significant content of motion Thus we need to remove these breakpoints by evaluating time scale and displacement of positions We employ Minimal Distance Percentage Principle MDPP 6 MDPP is an intuitive smoothing process and evaluate time scale and displacement of break points This algorithm can remove breakpoints such as too short time and tiny movement As a result segments which generated by remaining breakpoints is meaningful since the interval between twice of them is larger or there is an important movement MDPP is defined as follws Given a sequence of breakpoints t1,zi  tM,zM a minimal time T and a mini mal ratio of amplitude P if the breakpoints ti,zi and ti+l,zi+l will be re moved where z is the maximum position and zmin is the minimum position Figure 4 shows how MDPP works We set param eters T  0.5 and P  0.5 Black and white circles represent breakpoints detected by the change of speed Time Figure 4 Discrement of breakpoints by using MDPP MDPP is calculated using the above formula and re moves each two breakpoints under the threshold in this case T  0.5 and P  0.5 Thus white circles are removed and black circles remain as proper break points MDPP is executed in x y and z-axis respectively that is MDPP evaluates breakpoints of each axis as one dimension We have a 3-D data then we should calculate a spatial distance between breakpoints Fig ure 5 shows the motion data in the space After removing the noisy breakpoints of each axis by using MDPP the breakpoints of each axis are in tegrated in 3-D space Figure 5 represents the break points detected by our algorithm One of the original candidate 223L\224 in Figure 5 was removed because the change of contents does not occur at the candidate breakpoint z Figure 5 Discernment of breakpoints by spatial rela tionship The algorithm works as follows let us consider the sequence of three candidate breakpoints First the distance from the first breakpoint 223F\224 to the last breakpoint 223L\224 is calculated then the longest dis tance between the first breakpoint and the last break point is located If the most distant point from both 223F\224 and 223L\224 is not the midpoint 223M\224 it means the midpoint is not a breakpoint Thus the midpoint is removed from the candidate set Finally we can ob  202  


tain black circles in Fig 5 as a result 4 DTW as an evaluation measure for motion data Human voice has a finite number of phonemes but human motion does not have pre-defined patterns and the number of primitive motions is unknown Thus we employ a simple and powerful unsupervised learn ing algorithm Nearest Neighbor NN algorithm l for clustering primitive motions It can be represented by the following rules classify an unknown pattern and choose the class of the nearest cluster by mea sureing the distance Our data is a time series data of human motion which has a sequence of arbitrary length So we must evaluate the similarity between sequences of different length in time series To align the time series,we em ploy the 223Dynamic Time Warping\224 method \(DTW 21 which was developed in speech recognition domain When we applied the DTW on our motion data the best correspondence between two time series was found Although voice wave is one dimension, motion data is three demension So we extend DTW to apply 3-D time series data We will explain how DTW calculates similarity be tween two time series Assume two discrete time series A and B are given as follows A  ai  a  aM B  bi  bj  b,v 1 where a and bj are the ith and jth factors of A and B The similarity between A and B is given by the following formulas x  xoi x*i Y  y yaj z  zai 2bj di i3  JX2+Y2+Z2 2 Si-1.j-2  2di,j-1  di,j S;-2,j-1  Zdi-i,j  d;,j Si  min Si-l,i-l  2di,j S1,i  di,i 3 i D\(A,B  SM,N However the similarity calculated by DTW does not always correspond to our intuition because of an extreme matching of two patterns and disregarding similarities of x y and z-axis respectively In order to modify it we add the following formulas s1,j  SiJ  M 4 5 where Nail is the number of dimension and N is the number of dimension under the threshold By using DTW as evaluation measure nearest neighbor based algorithm takes the following phases The algorithm calculates distances between the new data and the already existing clusters Then the al gorithm finds the nearest distance and compares that distance to the given threshold If it is smaller than the threshold the algorithm classifies the new data to the cluster that gave the smallest distance If not it makes a new cluster for the new data Figure 6 shows the process of clustering A B C and D In this example given threshold is 100 and the table in Figure 6 represents distances between two data For instance the distance between data A and data B is 90 1 For a given data A the algorithm creates a new cluster for the data A see phase a 2 For the next data B the algorithm calculates the distance between the new data B and the already existing cluster only A The distance between B and A 90 is smaller than the given threshold loo then algorithm classifies B in the already existing cluster see phase b 3 For the next data C the distance between C and A 50 is smaller than the threshold and the distance between C and B 150 is larger than the threshold so the algorithm splits the cluster includes A and B into two clusters In other words the algorithm clas sifies A and C in the same cluster and makes a new cluster for B see phase c 4 Finally for the next data D the cluster including C should be the cluster for D because the distance between D and C 40 is the smallest for D But the distance between D and A 150 is larger than the threshold so the algorithm splits the cluster including A and C into two clusters one includes C and D and the other includes only A As a result, there will he three clusters one includes C and D the other includes only A and the last includes only B However the weak point of this algorithm is that the construction of clusters strongly depends on the first data which we call 223seed\224 That is our algorithm receives input from the time series data and maintains  203  


Figure 6 Clustering algorithm one current cluster Depending on the received input the early clusters may be incorrect, requiring revision to make it consistent with new input Figure 7 shows the effect of seed In Figure 7 a we give the data A B C and D in the alphabetic order that is we give data A as seed In Figure 7 b we give the same data in the reverse order that is we give data D as seed The result of clustering in Figure 7 a does not correspond to that in Figure 7 b Thus construction of clusters depends on seed and this might cause a misclassification Therefore we apply the merging method to reduce the dependency on seed Merging combines two ex isting clusters when a cluster splits An example of merging occurs when D is added as shown in Fig ure 6 When D is given a cluster including A and C splits into two clusters, including C and D and in cluding only A Now a splitted cluster including A could merge with the other existing clusters At that time the distance between A and B is smaller than the threshold so A and B should be merged into the same cluster As a result there will be two clusters as shows Figure 7 b Then, the merging method enables us to reduce the dependency on seed is successful B v IW Figure 7 Effects of seed 5 Discovery of motion association After segmenting and clustering processes a multi stream that represents human motion is expressed as rules in symbol multi-stream a multiple sequences of symbols We call the sequence of symbol a multi-stream Each symbol represents the segment of certain clus ter so the length of zones with the same symbol is usually different In addition segmentation process is executed on streams of the body parts Therefore bor ders of zones on the streams rarely appear at the same point on the time axis Thus the symbol multi-stream is synchronized at the points where the changes of the content occur as shown in Figure 8 a We call motions that influence on the others as 223ac tive motions\224 and we call 223passive motions\224 the ac tions influenced by the 223active motions\224 In order to find active motions and passive motions we set 2 windows W active and W passive\with tixed interval By sliding the 2 windows on synchronized symbol multi-stream we can find motion association rules Then combinations of symbol patterns in W and W represent motion association rules We define the strength of motion association rules by using the frequency of occurrence for two symbol patterns The frequency is calculated by the following function where CO is the identifier of motion association rules Po and P are patterns which appears in 2 windows W and W t\(Pa is the number of occurrences of P and t\(Pa A P is the number of simultaneous occur rences of Pa and P That means the system calculates probability of occurrence for a pattern B which occurs after a pattern A in certain blocks of interval Our algorithm finds the pattern P which includes symbol 223B\224 223B 223L\224 223M in the streams of the right hand and elbow After two blocks of symbols from the beginning of Pa the algorithm finds the pattern Pb which consists of 223U\224 223U\224 223G\224 223G in the streams of the left hand and elbow as shown in Figure 8 a Assume that the combination of P and P occurs fie  204

The values of IW,l iW,l and 223int\224 may be determined flexibly This flexibility allows the system to find Pa and P with the same interval even if those sizes are set IW,l  2 IW,l  2 and int  2 or IW,l  3 IW,l  3 and int  1 This flexibility decreases the influence of the variation The system discovers many motion association rules from motion multi-stream and each of them has a degree of strength to characterize the motion Proba bility is an important parameter to define the strength and to select motion association rules as primitive mo tions for the motion However it still requires a deep consideration to define it 6 Experiments We prepared experimental data from 2 types of mo tion data One is rumba RM known as moody and passionate dance from middle America The other is Japanese traditional physical exercise JTPE Rumba is usually performed by a couple but in this case we prepared data performed only by man Table 1 shows the details of motion data for RM and JTPE Table 1 Details of motion data Amount I 23 I 25 I RM I JTPE Features about contents of motion data are RM We prepared the basic and the frequently used steps The arms are allowed to have wide varia tion of expression in dance but for our data, the Table 2 Clustering result Parts name I Nc I NE I Correct rate Left wrist I 203 I 27 I 86.7 Right wrist 187 23 Left elbow 100 19 Right elbow  lo 1 1  Left knee Right knee 64.0 Left ankle 50 20 60.0 Right ankle 50 17 64.0 Correct rate  100 x Nc  NE NC  The number of clusters NE  The number of error clusters performer keeps arms quiet The performer tried not to play extreme acts The steps include no movement of jumping JTPE The movements are mainly concentrate on the specific body parts arms and feet are usually fixed to the specific position Some motions in clude bending knees and jumping Figure 9 shows the numbers for segments according to the body parts 223Parts ID\224 in Figure 9 corresponds to the numbers in Figure 1 Figure 9 Details of segmentation Table 2 shows clustering result of JTPE Correct rates of wrists are higher than those of elbows because movement of wrist is larger than those of elbows and  205

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
