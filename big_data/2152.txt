978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n1 \n \n \nAbstract—Identifying the most suitable classifier for diagnostics \nis a challenging task. In addition to using domain expertise, a \ntrial and error method has been widely used to identify the \nmost suitable classifier. Classifier fusion can be used to \novercome this challenge and it has been widely known to \nperform better than single classifier. Classifier fusion helps in novercoming the error due to inductive bias of various \nclassifiers. The combination rule also plays a vital role in \nclassifier fusion, and it has not been well studied which \ncombination rules provide the best performance during \nclassifier fusion. Good combination rules will achieve good \ngeneralizability while taking advantage of the diversity of the \nclassifiers. In this work, we develop an approach for ensemble \nlearning consisting of an optimized combination rule. The \ngeneralizability has been acknowledged to be a challenge for ntraining a diverse set of classifiers, but it can be achieved by an \noptimal balance between bias and variance errors using the \ncombination rule in this paper. Generalizability implies the \nability of a classifier to learn the underlying model from the \ntraining data and to predict the unseen observations. In this \npaper, cross validation has been employed during performance \nevaluation of each classifier to get an unbiased performance \nestimate. An objective function is constructed and optimized \nbased on the performance evaluation to achieve the optimal \nbias-variance balance. This function can be solved as a \nconstrained nonlinear optimization problem. Sequential \nQuadratic Programming based optimization with better \nconvergence property has been employed for the optimization. \nWe have demonstrated the applicability of the algorithm by nusing support vector machine and neural networks as \nclassifiers, but the methodology can be broadly applicable for \ncombining other classifier algorithms as well. The method has \nbeen applied to the fault diagnosis of analog circuits. The \nperformance of the proposed algorithm has been compared to \nother combination rules in the literature. It is observed that the \nproposed combination rule performs better in reducing the \nnumber of false positives and false negatives. \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n1. INTRODUCTION 1 \n2.

INTRODUCTION \nThe field of prognostics and health management \(PHM availability and reliability of \nengineering systems [2] [3] [4]. As part of the PHM \nregimen, diagnostic algorithms have been developed and \nemployed to assist in fault diagnosis. As the number of \navailable PHM algorithms has increased, the algorithm \nselection process has become more complex and difficult. \nDilemmas for users when choosing a diagnostic algorithm in \nPHM include the following: whether the data utilized for ntraining is a suitable representation of the global population; \nhow well the algorithm will perform in a noisy environment; \nand how well the algorithm will perform on data that it has \nnot encountered \(i.e generalizability requirements for specific applications.  \nEnsemble learning is one technique that has been employed \nto improve generalizability [1] as well as in situations where \nthe training data is not a suitable representation of the global \npopulation. In ensemble learning, a collection of classifiers \nare trained simultaneously, and the results are combined in a \nsuitable manner \(also referred to as the combination rule to \nimprove performance. Generally, the approach of ensemble \nlearning is to train a diverse set of classifiers and then devise \na method to combine these trained classifiers. Diversity in \nthe ensemble learning context refers to different \nclassification outputs from each of the trained classifiers for \na given input sample set. Studies have reported on the \nimportance of and methodologies for generating diverse nclassifiers. Brown et al. [5] provided a mathematical account \nof the role of diversity in ensemble learning and how it helps \nto improve classification accuracy. Theoretically, the more \ndiverse the classifiers are the less correlated the classifier \noutputs are with each other. As a result, the prediction based \non each classifier of the ensemble could be complementary \nto each other, which implies when one classifier makes a nprediction error, other classifiers could be correct. The \ncomplementary nature of these classifiers helps in offsetting \npotential errors, thereby providing greater generalizability \nfor these algorithms.  \nSurya Kunche nCenter for Advanced Life \nCycle Engineering, University \nof Maryland, College Park, \nMD 20742 USA nksurya@calce.umd.edu \nChaochao Chen \nCenter for Advanced Life Cycle \nEngineering, University of \nMaryland College Park, MD \n20742 USA \nchaochao@calce.umd.edu \nMichael G.

The most widely used methodology \nfor diversity-generation 


focuses on manipulating the training \ndata; i.e., supplying each classifier with a different set of nmanipulated training data \(for example, training a classifier \nwith only part of the training data classifier is \ntrained with a manipulated training data set, it typically \ngenerates diverse predictions Commonly used methods for \nmanipulating training data are bootstrapping, bagging [17], \nand boosting [18 Diversity is also achieved by changing \nthe adjustable parameters of a classifier being trained; for \nexample in neural networks diversity can be achieved by \nchanging the initial weights, the number of hidden neurons nthe activation function and the training algorithm [5]. Some \nresearchers have proposed the use of an evolutionary \nalgorithm to achieve the optimal amount of diversity during \nthe training phase [19, 20, 21 nOnce diversity is achieved for the trained classifiers, a \ncombination rule is used to combine the classification \nresults. The most common means of classifier fusion include \naveraging [7, 8], majority voting 9, 10, 11], weighted \nmajority voting [12], and a localized fusion [13,14] based \napproach that improves the weighted majority voting \nalgorithm  by evaluating the performance of classifiers in the \nneighborhood of the test points. Bonissone et al. [15] \nproposed a fusion methodology based on Cartesian and \nregression trees that reduces the computation time in the \nlocalized fusion. \nThe error of any machine learning algorithm can be \nclassified into two parts: the bias component and the \nvariance component. Given a training set\t\t t\n,  =\n1,2,? ,} for\t = 1,2,?, where  is the feature vector \nand \t  is the corresponding class vector Let\t\t be the \nclassifier trained on training set\t and\t\t  is the prediction \nof classifier\t for input feature\t . The bias component of the \nerror is defined as shown in \(1 component describes the correctness of the model [36]. \nThe variance of the classifier is as shown in \(2 nvariance component describes the precision of the model and \nhow prediction \t varies with training set 36]. A machine \nlearning algorithm achieves minimal prediction errors on \nunseen data when there is an optimal balance of bias and \nvariance [35]. Figure 1 shows the changes in errors \nincluding bias, variance and total error as the value of \nmodel complexity changes. As seen in Figure 1, good \ngeneralizability is achieved by an optimal balance of bias \nand variance. \n = ? |\t ? \t 1 2 3 on their performance so \nas to achieve the least total error in fault detection, i.e., the \nleast number of false and missed alarms. To achieve this \noptimized fusion, we compute bias and variance to evaluate \nthe performance of each classifier. The performance of the \nclassifiers is also validated with a cost function using cross \nvalidation. We then developed a framework for this \nmethodology that combines all the classifiers. A \ncomparative analysis using experimental data has been \nconducted to demonstrate the accuracy of this algorithm \nover other methodologies. \nWe discuss our optimized fusion methodology in section 2. \nIn section 3 we present 2 case studies wherein we used this \nmethodology to perform diagnostics for different analog \ncircuits including a sallen-key band pass filter and a biquad \nlow pass filter. We also conducted a comparative analysis to \nevaluate the performance of this methodology. In section 4 \nwe give concluding remarks. \n2. OPTIMIZED FUSION METHODOLOGY \nInductive bias [22] is defined as the set of assumptions that a nclassifier makes in order to classify a given set of features. \nFor example, support vector machine classification \(Figure \n2 nearest neighbor classification, the \n \nFigure 1 – Error change as a function of model complexity \n[33] [36 n \nPoint of least \ntotal error \n \nFigure 2 – SVM classification. \n \n 3 \nassumption is that the distance of a test point from the k \nnearest neighbors of each test point determines the class of \nthe test point, i.e., the test point belongs to the class to which \nthis distance is least. These assumptions may not necessarily \nbe true in all instances; for example, as seen in Figure 2, the \nhyperplane of the support vector machine is not able to \ncorrectly determine the decision boundary in this two-class \n\(blue and green Hence, the \nassumptions made by the classifiers lead to an error known \nas inductive bias in classification which is a classification \nerror. \nIn classifier fusion the complementary features of the \nclassifiers are employed to overcome their individual errors. \nTo achieve this, classifier algorithms are initially trained on nthe training data set, and then the classification outputs of \nthe classifier algorithms are combined. The method for \ncombining the results of all these classifiers is known as the \nfusion or combination rule. Figure 3 shows the proposed \nframework for the fusion of an ensemble of classifiers. The \nframework can be divided into three parts—algorithm \ntraining, fusion parameter computation, and classifier fusion. \nThese three parts are discussed in the following subsections. \nAlgorithm Training \nWhen training the classifiers, the training data must be \nrepresentative of the global data population. In most \nsituations, the training data constitute only a small part of the \nwhole data population and may have a lot of noise, which \ncan lead to 


misclassification of unseen data sets. \nBootstrapping is a potential solution to this problem nBootstrapping—The bootstrapping method was originally \nproposed by Efron [23]. When bootstrapping is used nresampling of training data is done such that sample \nobservations are picked randomly by replacement from the \noriginal training data to form new training data sets which \nare the same size as the original training data set [24]. \nConsidering an original training data which has N \nobservations, the bootstrapped training sets also consist of N \nobservations but these observations are picked by randomly \nresampling from original training data set. Individual \nclassifiers are then trained on these data sets. Once the \nclassifiers are trained, their classification performance can \nbe evaluated by cross-validation, wherein they are evaluated non observations that they have not been trained on. This \nprocedure gives an unbiased estimate of the classification \nerror and is discussed in detail in section performance \nevaluation. \nThe aim of bootstrapping is to increase the diversity of the \nalgorithm. As suggested previously, increasing the diversity \nduring training improves the generalizability when a suitable \ncombination rule is applied. Diversity has been achieved by \nusing bootstrapped training data with different initial \n \nFigure 3 – Optimized fusion framework n \n 4 \nweights in the neural networks as well as using various \nclassifiers \(neural networks and support vector machines to be trained on these \nsamples. Different classifiers are employed to overcome the \nproblem of inductive bias. In this paper, a support vector \nmachine and neural networks are employed. Each \nmember/classifier of the ensemble is trained to be a \nclassification expert on the individual bootstrapped samples. \nSupport vector machine \(SVM  The objective of SVM is to find the \noptimal hyperplane is the distance of the hyperplane \nfrom the origin of the coordinate system [31]. Given an input nfeature vector , &, ., … . , 1  where  ? 31 and its \ncorresponding class is \t, \t& , \t., … . , \t1 where \t ? {?1, 1}, \nthe aim of the support vector machine is to find an optimal \nhyper plane \( such that the objective function shown in \nEquation \(4 5 for the hyper plane, the following \nobjective function is minimized which results in a \nhyperplane that optimally separates the two classes. \nmin 7\(, 8\n = \t & ?\(?& + 9? 8&                     \(4 t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t t\t>{?1, 1}\t       \(5 margin \nintroduced to allow any misclassifications, and 9\tis the \npenalty or the cost for the misclassifications.

The \noutput of the neural network is the class label of the input \nfeatures. We used a gradient-based approach to train the \nneural network. \nFusion Parameter Computation \nThe diverse classifiers generated in the previous step need to \nbe suitably combined Here, a cost function has been \nformulated and minimized to obtain the most suitable \ncombination of these classifiers. The fusion parameter \ncomputation includes two steps: performance evaluation and \nfusion optimization. \nPerformance Evaluation—To evaluate the classification \nperformance, the bias and variance errors of each classifier \nneed to be computed for the unseen observations by cross-\nvalidation. Bias and variance errors cannot be minimized \nsimultaneously because a reduction in either one of the two \ncomponents could lead to an increase in the other, as shown \nin Figure 1. Therefore, the total error of a classifier is used to \nevaluate classification performance, which is a combination \nof both of these factors, as shown below 33]: \n:@:A\t#  @ = \t+& + B !"#\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\nTo estimate the bias of the classifiers conventional \nvalidation methods will segment the training data into \ndisjoint sets, e.g., training and validation data sets. For \nexample, a data set can be segmented into two parts wherein \n70% of the data are used to train the classifier and the \nremaining 30% are used for optimizing the classifier \nparameters [34 But such a method is biased by the \nvalidation data. To choose how much data to use for training \nand validation, cross-validation has been thought to provide \nan unbiased estimate. In cross-validation, each of the trained \nclassifiers is evaluated for accuracy on unseen observations.  \nIf training data are resampled into B bootstrapped sample \nsets, each classifier is trained on different sample sets. Once \nall the classifiers are trained, the performance of each \nclassifier is evaluated on the unseen observations in the ntraining data. The errors computed are the false positive \nerror \(DE E in \(7 7 t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t?\t\t?\t+\t!I\t\t\t = 1,\n+: 1 ?  \nwhere \tE\tis the output of the classifier trained on the

For \nexample, neural networks that have too many hidden layers \nand nodes can have an over-fitting problem that results in \nhigh variance and low bias and therefore poor \ngeneralizability performance [37].

The fusion optimization method helps achieve a \ngood bias–variance balance, thereby providing good \ngeneralizability. \nThe errors of false positive and false negative are calculated \nvia cross-validation, as discussed in the previous section. For \na given classifier\tPE , let the false positive error be DE  and the \nfalse negative error be\tQE ,\t+: 1 ?  \(i.e there are B \nclassifiers trained on the bootstrapped data cost of having a false positive is R \nand that the cost for a false negative is\tR&. The cost nfactors,\tR\tand\tR&, serve as prioritizing parameters, and they \nare relative terms that are used to prioritize the significance \nof false positives and false negatives in the cost function. For \nusers who depend on system diagnostics for scheduling \nmaintenance, the cost of a false positive is the cost incurred nwhen a healthy system is erroneously classified as faulty, \nand the cost of a false negative is occurred due to the \nerroneous classification of a faulty system as healthy. These \ncosts may not necessarily be tangible some of the intangible \ntypes of cost, such as safety, customer satisfaction, \navailability, etc., could be incorporated. Quantifying these \ncosts is out of the scope of this paper as these costs typically \nvary across organizations and applications.

The output signal \ndecomposed into 8 levels by using discrete wavelet \ntransform. To obtain healthy features, a sweep signal was \napplied to the circuit with nominal values for the critical \ncomponents for 50 times.

The total output \nresponses, including healthy and faulty, are 50 + 10 × 5 × 12 \n= 650. The feature set was divided equally into two parts: \none for training and the other for testing.

CONCLUSIONS \nThe generalizability of an algorithm is affected by many nfactors, for example, noise, training data which is not a good \nrepresentation of global population inductive bias of \nclassifiers, etc. Classifier fusion has been widely used to \nimprove the generalizability While bias compensation has \nbeen a widely accepted strategy in the literature to improve \nthe classification performance of fused classifiers, variance \nalso plays a significant role in the performance of the nclassifiers. It has been discussed in the literature that an \noptimal balance between bias and variance led to good \ngeneralizability. \nIn this paper we proposed a novel combination rule to \nimprove the classification accuracy of diagnostic algorithms \nand its generalizability. The objective function formulated \ncan achieve an optimum balance between bias and variance \nand find the optimal classifier combination strategy using nsequential quadratic programming. Bootstrapping was \nemployed to reduce the ambiguity about how well the ntraining data is representative of the global population. Cross \nvalidation was used to compute an unbiased estimate of the \nbias and variance of each classifier. The experimental results \ndemonstrate that the proposed fusion methodology has \nsignificant fault diagnosis performance improvement over \nother fusion methodologies and individual classifiers \(neural \nnetwork and support vector machine algorithm by varying the cost factors and \nthe results demonstrate that the cost factor used in the bias nequation helps in prioritizing either the false positives or the \nfalse negatives. \nREFERENCES \n[1] R Polikar, “Ensemble based systems in decision \nmaking”, IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine, vol.6, \nno.3 pp.21-45, Third Quarter 2006. \n[2] N.M., Vichare, M.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
