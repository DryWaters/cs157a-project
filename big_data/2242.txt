Datasets available\nin computer vision literature are relatively small and could\ninclude noise due to labeling source. For new and relatively\nbig datasets, noise amount would possible increase and the\nperformance of traditional instance based learning methods is\nlikely to decrease. In this work, we propose a multiple instance\nlearning-based solution in case of an increase in noise. For\nthis purpose, each video is represented with spatio-temporal\nfeatures, then bag-of-words method is applied. Then, using\nsupport vector machines \(SVM learning classifiers are constructed and\ncompared. The classification results show that multiple instance\nlearning classifiers has better performance than instance based\nlearning counterparts on noisy videos.\nKeywords—Human Action Recognition, Multiple Instance\nLearning, Video Understanding, Data Noise\nI GI?RI?S¸\nI?nsan hareketleri tan?ma, bilgisayarl? görünün önemli ve\nüzerinde çokça çal?s¸?lan alanlar?ndan biridir.

the input split and thus training for\ndifferent features can be run in parallel in different Mapper.\nEach Mapper runs T iterations for feature fi on the data\nchunk it receives. Each iteration forms a weak classi?er for\nthat feature. At iteration t, Mapper emits feature index fi as\nkey and a composite pair as value. That pair contains weak\nclassi?er formed at that iteration h\(t t from the Map task is fed into Reducer procedure.\nAll values for the same key are always reduced together\nregardless of which Mapper is its origin. Reducer receives a\nkey and list of values associated to it As it has been discussed\nearlier, in our case Map output key is the index of feature and\nvalue is the combination of weak classi?er and weight for\nthe weak classi?er. So in our design, Reducer receives feature\nindex as key and all the weak classi?er associated with that\nfeature along with their weights as list of values associate to\nthat key. From these information Reducer forms and emits the\n?nal ADABOOST ensemble for that feature as value and\nindex of feature as key.\nIn our initial approach system ?rst collects current data\nchunk and the list of features that need ADABOOST ensem-\nble classi?er. These are copied to HDFS\(Hadoop distributed\n?le system feature. Mappers\nform weak classi?ers for ADABOOST sub ensemble for a\nparticular feature and emit this for Reducer. Reducer receives\nall these weak classi?er and form the ?nal ADABOOST\nensemble for all the features Output of Reducer then are\ncopied back to the system for updating current ensembles in\ndifferent hierarchy.\nLater we have made some optimizations in our initial\napproach. First our system after collecting current data chunk\nplace it in DistributedCache of Hadoop. DistributedCache\nis a facility provided by the MapReduce framework to cache\n?les needed by applications. The framework copies the nec-\nessary ?les on to the slave node before any tasks for the job\nare executed on that node. Its ef?ciency stems from the fact\nthat the les are only copied once per job and the ability to\ncache archives which are un-archived on the slaves Another\noptimization we have applied is to customize the way Hadoop\nsplits input ?le. The number of Map tasks in a Hadoop job\ndepends on number of input ?le splits. In our design input\n?le is basically list of features for which we need to build\nclassi?er. So increasing input split infers increasing number\nof Mappers running for the job and thus increasing level of\nparallelism.\nAlgorithm 1 Pseudocode for Mapper\n1: procedure INITIALIZE\(context cache ?le\n3: end procedure\n4: procedure MAP\(f , T 1n , ....., 1n t LearnWeakClassifier\(wt, F xi 1/2 1 do  for all the data instances\nloaded in INITIALIZE method\n11: if ht\(xi else\n14: wt+1i ? w\nt\ni\n2\(1 f , \(?t, h\(t procedure\nPseudocode for Mapper is given in algorithm 1. INI-\nTIALIZE procedure is called before actual MAP begins.\nIn INITIALIZE method Mapper loads data chunk from\nDistributedCache to corresponding data structure. To form\nADABOOST ensemble for a feature, algorithm needs to\niterate over the whole dataset multiple times. By loading the\ndataset in a data structure makes it more ef?cient in terms of\nexecution time.\nThe Map procedure then starts with an initial uniform\nweight distribution to the data instances in the current data\nchunk\(line 5 w\nt\ni = 1.\nAt each iteration, a weak learner function is applied to the\nweighted version of the data which then returns an optimal\nweak hypothesis h\(t line 7 nd an optimal h\(t line\n9 Weights for the data instances are re-calculated in for loop\nof line 10. The data instances which are not classi?ed correctly\nin current iteration is given higher priority in the next iteration.\nThus weak classi?er in the next iteration focuses more on the\nsamples that were previously misclassi?ed. At the end of each\niteration, Mapper emits feature index as key and a complex\nvalue consisting of weight for the weak classi?er and the weak\nclassi?er itself.\nPseudocode for Reducer is given in algorithm 2. In Hadoop,\nthe Reducer receives a key and list of values associated to this\nparticular key from Mapper. Values associated with a speci?c\nkey are processed by the same Reducer. So in our design\nReducer will receive feature index as key and a list of all the\n391\nAlgorithm 2 Pseudocode for Reducer\n1: procedure REDUCE\(f , List\(?t, h\(t H\(f t f , H\(f Reducer then\nprepares the ?nal ADABOOST ensemble by taking weighted\nsum of all the weak classi?ers for that feature in line 2. H\(f and ADABOOST ensemble\nfor that feature as <key, value> pair.\nOutput from Reducer is written in the HDFS ?le system\nwhich is then copied to the local ?le system. ADABOOST\nensemble for features are extracted from the ?le afterwards and\nused to update the whole hierarchical structure. In this way,\nusing MapReduce ADABOOST ensembles for all numeric\nfeatures can be formed with a very high level of parallelism.\nWe tested our approach 


with several data sets having large\nnumber of features. We used different size of chunks to\nexamine performance of our approach. We have observed that\nit is especially useful when the number of features is large\nor the size of the data chunk is large. We have discussed\nexperimental results in details in Section V.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nWe have implemented our base approach \(Heterogeneous\nHierarchical Ensemble, or HHE 1] using Java JDK ver-\nsion 1.6.0.39. For MapReduce implementation we have used\nHadoop version 1.0.4. We have tested our MapReduce im-\nplementation in a cluster having 9 data nodes. Each data\nnode is a i7 ? 2600K machine running linux. We have\nshown performance comparison in terms of execution time and\nclassi?cation accuracy. We have carried out our experiments\nfor different size of data chunk and different number of Maps\nto evaluate impact of MapReduce parallelism.\nIn order to evaluate our MapReduce implementation we\nused several established benchmark data sets. Table III depicts\nthe characteristics of the data sets.\nTABLE III: Data Set Characteristics\nName of Instances Classes Numeric Nominal\nDataSet Features Features\nKDD 490,000 21 39 3\nPAMAP2 3,850,505 19 52 0\nForestCover 581,000 7 54 0\nThe KDD data set is from KDD Cup 1999. It contains\ninformation pertaining to network traf?c metrics and attributes\nwith both normal traf?c and 20 types of network attack traf?c.\nFor the second data set, we used a large data set - Physical\nActivity Monitoring Data Set \(PAMAP2 from UCI [13] - to\ntest performance of DXMiner [5] and our methods as this data\nset is extremely large, has numerous features, evolving con-\ncepts, and is stream oriented. In this data set, nine persons were\nequipped with sensors that gathered a total of 52 streaming\nmetrics attributes whilst they performed activities Eighteen\ntotal activities were identi?ed as class labels - including a\nsingle Other category for miscellaneous or transient activities Error 7.9% 3.2% 2.0%\nAUC 0.750 0.974 0.988\nDXMiner Error 5.2% 11.9% 48.3%\nAUC 0.720 - 0.685\nFor the third data set, Forest Cover, was obtained from the\nUCI repository as explained in [5]. It contains 54 numeric\nattributes. We use all the attributes as they arrive in the\nstream by parsing the data ?le without ltering and without\nnormalization.\nTABLE V: Average Execution time\(in Second and MapReduce implementation\nDataset Sizeof Original MapReduce\nchunk HHE Implementation\n1000 12.9 76.1\n5000 61.2 100.3\nForestCover 10000 177.6 159.2\n20000 295.7 225.9\n30000 555.8 380.4\n1000 2.0 39.9\n5000 28.8 46.8\nPAMAP2 10000 84.1 66.6\n20000 228.8 127.1\n30000 361.0 177.6\n1000 0.8 50.7\n5000 20.0 126.7\nKDD 10000 91.5 230.5\n20000 174.5 246.7\n30000 353.5 317.1\nImplementation of our approach with MapReduce exhibits\nthe same accuracy as our base approach HHE without MapRe-\nduce implementation. We chose to compare the accuracy\nresults of our algorithm against DXMiner since DXMiner\nfocuses on solving many of the same problems we do, and has\nbeen shown to perform well for labeling streaming data [5].\nSince we obtained access to the executables for DXMiner, we\nare able to compare the performance of our method against\nDXMiner on new benchmark data sets We also compare\nresults of implementation with MapReduce against our orig-\ninal approach without MapReduce implementation to show\ndramatic improvement in terms of execution time.\nComparison between HHE and DXMiner [5 in terms of\naccuracy is shown in Table IV. Both method is evaluated\nfor each of the three benchmark data sets with regard to the\naverage error and the Area Under the Curve \(AUC integrating the Receiver\nOperating Characteristic \(ROC positive to false negative for an algorithm,\nand is thus a more robust depiction of an algorithms overall\nperformance. Likewise the AUC metric is a more robust single-\nvalue metric for comparing algorithms 16]. Note that the KDD\nAUC value for DXMiner is not listed since the DXMiner\napplication failed to return an AUC number, and did not log\nenough information to compute the ROC or AUC manually.\nOur approach HHE shows signi?cantly better accuracy in\ncase of KDD and PAMAP2 datasets. On the other hand HHE\nshows competitive accuracy in case of ForestCover dataset.\n392\nFig. 5: Comparison of Execution time between original HHE\nvs HHE with MapReduce \(Ten Map tasks continuous\nor discrete without normalization done in [5]. DXMiner\nhandle a reduced feature set discarding the discrete data and\nhave to normalize all features to ranges between \(0.0, 1.0 ForestCover dataset does not truly have a dynamic feature\nspace. DXMiner retains union of all features for its learners\nas it progresses. Therefore the lower error of DXMiner on\nForestCover dataset is not surprising due to ?xed feature set\nin the data.\nTABLE VI: Average Execution time\(in Second Map tasks\nSizeof Number Number Number\nDataset chunk of of of\nMap = 3 Map = 5 Map = 10\n1000 76.2 77.3 76.1\n5000 103.9 102.9 100.3\nForestCover 10000 174.1 164.8 159.2\n20000 249.1 241.3 225.9\n30000 458.6 411.5 380.4\n1000 40.0 40.1 39.9\n5000 48.9 47.8 46.8\nPAMAP2 10000 73.8 68.5 66.6\n20000 138.3 130.2 127.1\n30000 214.1 184.7 177.6\n1000 50.5 51.7 50.7\n5000 124.5 126.2 126.7\nKDD 10000 235.8 230.9 230.5\n20000 251.3 251.0 246.7\n30000 338.3 321.7 317.1\nExecution time for HHE and MapReduce implementation\nusing different size of chunk is listed 


in Table V. It is clear\nfrom the data that MapReduce implementation outperforms\noriginal HHE with suf?ciently large chunk size.\nFigure 5 graphically represents comparison of execu-\ntion time between HHE and MapReduce implementation for\nForestCover dataset. It can be observed from the ?gure that\nfor chunk sizes less than 8000 original approach HHE shows\nbetter execution time comparing to MapReduce implemen-\ntation. But for chunk sizes larger than 8000, HHE with\nMapReduce implementation shows signi?cantly better results\nin terms of execution time. This is not surprising as Hadoop\nhas some overhead of its own which contributes to its greater\nexecution time initially when chunk size is not very large.\nAs chunk size gets larger those overhead becomes well paid\nand MapReduce implementation shows better execution time.\nAnother observation from the empirical data is in case of\nKDD dataset, it needs comparatively larger size of chunk to\nshow a better execution time For MapReduce implementation.\nThe reason behind this is KDD has much fewer attributes\ncomparing with the other two datasets. So it takes larger chunk\nsize in case of KDD dataset to overcome internal overhead of\nrunning Hadoop. So from these empirical data it can be said\nthat MapReduce implementation is very useful specially when\nnumber of feature or size of data chunk is high.\nFig. 6: Comparison of Execution time using different number\nof Map for ForestCover dataset\nWe have experimented our MapReduce solution with dif-\nferent number of Map tasks. In?uence of number of Map tasks\non average execution time is shown in Table VI. We have\ncontrolled number of Mapper by changing block size of the\ninput ?le to the Hadoop. This input ?le contains list of features\nfor which we need to build ADABOOST ensemble. Result\nshows that Execution time is reduced signi?cantly with higher\nnumber of Mapper. Figure 6 more clearly depicts the power\nof MapReduce parallelism As the number of Mappers get\nincreased, the number of features per Mapper get decreased.\nSo ADABOOST ensembles for different features are formed\nwith more parallelism. From the Figure 6 we can observe that\nwith larger number of Map, execution time per data chunk falls\ndown for different chunk sizes. It is true especially when chunk\nsize is large. To build an ADABOOST ensemble classi?er T\nnumber of iterations over the dataset is needed, where T is the\nnumber of weak classi?er in the ensemble. Decreased number\nof features per Map task leads to low number of iterations over\nthis huge dataset for each Map. Thus with increased number\nof Map tasks, execution time per data chunk is decreased.\nFrom the above analysis it is clear that our base ap-\nproach HHE shows better accuracy comparing with other\n393\napproaches which also tend to solve the similar problems of\nlabeling instances in evolving data streams. Moreover applying\nMapReduce based parallelism to this robust technique makes it\nsigni?cantly faster and increase its scalability in case of larger\nchunks of data or high number of features.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nOur work presented in this paper shows an improvement\nover our current effort to design an ef?cient method which\nrapidly learns the concepts in a data stream, predicts labels for\nnew data with strong accuracy, and agilely tracks the dynamic\nchanges in the evolving concepts and feature space. In this\npaper, We have tried to address the scalability issue in our\nbase approach [1]. We have shown through algorithmic and\nempirical analysis that our method is more ef?cient than the\nbase approach in terms of execution time especially in case of\nlarge number of features and large data chunks. Compared\nto alternative methods, our approach adapts well to data\nstreams, and tends to more tightly approximate the decision\nboundaries of the target classes. We demonstrated that training\nof ADABOOST sub-ensemble in parallel for handling large\nnumber of features are useful to decrease execution time\nsigni?cantly.\nWe intend to continue to improve upon our methodology\nand add additional components to further adapt to changes\nin the data stream, including novel classes. we will continue\nto investigate variations to further optimize both speed and\naccuracy. We will also apply further parallelism in training of\nother sub-ensemble types other than ADABOOST and testing\nphases in future.\nVII.

and\nlatency.\nConsistency, which has been long studied [39], attracts\nmore eyes in recent years. With the consideration of CAP [3]\nand PACELC [4], people develop a lot of consistency models,\nfrom weakest eventual consistency [9], timeline consistency\n[40] to causal consistency [41]. Instead of developing a new\nconsistency model or performance optimization for existing\nmodels, we discuss when and how the inconsistency occurs,\nand further measure its degree with a probabilistic model in\nthe context of RSMs.\nThere are several works [17,18 presenting bounded read\nstaleness from data versions, stale time and staleness proba-\nbility to evaluate the inconsistency of quorum like [15], anti-\nentropy [35] systems, where writes are committed by vector\n10\nclocks 16] with semantic reconciliation [5] in causal order as\nopposed to total order of RSMs. In this work, we focus on\nwrite inconsistency for RSMs, since read serializability can be\neasily guaranteed in total order to eliminate read staleness.\nSome previous works have been done on write inconsisten-\ncy. [19,20] provide techniques to make writes satisfying some\nconstraints, which use strong and weak consistency to ensure\nthe constraints are not violated. Write divergency of replicas\nare limited in [21,22]. For example, [21] provides some metrics\nsuch as numerical error and order error for data items, and\nthen presents a variety of algorithms for writes to guarantee\npredefined metrics. These write inconsistency models aim to\nimprove the performance in the absence of crash failures, but\nwe want to know how much inconsistency incurred by crash\nfailures a replication system may encounter, rather than confine\nwrites to some constraints, or bound the maximum deviation\nof a value from its newest version.\nIn the context of RSMs, in this work we quantify write\ninconsistency by the probability of write conflict while con-\nsidering crash failures. Furthermore, we calculate write latency\nand describe how to quantitatively make consistency and\nlatency tradeoff from the aspect of system benefit.\nIX. DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we provide several problems that should be\nnoted or considered in future work.\nA. Quorum Systems\nQuorum systems define sets of replicas W written to and\nR read from, which can be configured such as ONE\(W=1 W = [n/2] + 1 W = n other values. This is very like the three representative\nimplementations of RSMs, but they are essentially different.\nThe reason is that writes of quorum systems are ordered\ncausally and those of RSMs are totally ordered. Thus some\nconditions result in write conflict for RSMs but not for quorum\nsystems. For instance write duplication may occur when the\ncoordinator is falsely suspected. In contrast, it is meaningless\nto discuss write conflict for quorum systems because we can\nnot decide the original write and possible duplicated one are\nin the same order or not for the partial orders of writes. In\nthe practical quorum systems at present they mostly view the\nsecond write as a new write.\nHowever, our partial work can be useful for analyzing\nquorum systems. The formula on the expectation of laten-\ncy\(equation \(8 if\nreplacing W to d.\nB. Failure Mode and Failure Detection\nAs discussed in section II, our work is based on the\nassumption of non-Byzantine failures. If we enlarge failure\nmodes to Byzantine ones, our work should be made corre-\nsponding modification. In future work, we will consider this\nextension.\nFor non-Byzantine failures, we have modeled a common\nand popular heartbeat based but not adaptive and fast failure\ndetector Some optimized failure detectors [31,36] use syn-\nchronized clocks or adjust heartbeat intervals adaptively to\nachieve faster failure detection. This means that the expression\nThb2?Thb1 > To?Te in the formula of the probability of false\nsuspicion Pfs = Pr\(Thb2 ? Thb1 > To ? Te detectors.\nC. Coordinator Election and Failure Recovery\nWhile presenting the formula of write duplication, we have\nnoted that coordinator election and failure recovery [32] may\ninfluence its result.\nRSMs run coordinator election and failure recovery after\nsuspicions on coordinators for synchronizing the states of\nboth committed writes and historical records for replicas. This\nsynchronization may enlarge the range of historical records\nperceived by the new coordinator. Thus the historical records\nincurred by writes sent by the suspected coordinator may be\ncaught by the new coordinator during coordinator election and\nfailure recovery. This will avoid the reuse of sequence numbers\nand lower the probability of write duplication. Although we\ncan also provide a formula to measure the impact of coor-\ndinator election and failure recovery on write duplication it\ndepends on the specific processes of them, which can be very\ndifferent.\nD. Independence of Crash Failures and Message Delays\nAlthough we have released some assumptions in the com-\nputation of probability of write conflict and latency, we still\nassume that crash events of different nodes and message\ndelays between replicas are independent. In practice, they do\nnot always hold, since replica nodes and network links in\nmodern data centers usually share physical machines, routers\nand power devices and so on. However, the correlations among\nfailures and delays depend on the specific hardware and\nsoftware implementations. A reasonable solution is to acquire\nthe correlation factors among failures and delays by statistics\nfor established replication systems, and then append them to\nthe probability of crash failures and the message delays for\nmore accurate results.\nX. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we are concerned with providing a quan-\ntitative analysis of the 


relationship between consistency and\nlatency. Given that replicated state machines are widely used\nin modeling replication systems and there are several variants\nof RSM implementations, we first propose a generic model\ncalled RSM-d to give a unified description of major replication\nprotocols using RSMs. Second, on the basis of RSM-d, we\nbuild a probabilistic model for write conflicts that is one of the\nkey factors to cause inconsistency, and a probabilistic model\nfor characterizing latency as well. Third, we further define\na payoff model through combining the write conflict model\nand latency model from the perspective of a service provider.\nFinally, with Monte Carlo based simulation, we validate our\npresented results and show the effectiveness of our solution to\nmake tradeoff between consistency and latency to achieve the\nmaximum system benefit.\n11\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Richong Zhang and Yu\nTang for their discussions and feedback improved this work.\nThis work was supported partly by National Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China No. 61103031, No. 61272165 No. 2012AA011203 Author of National Excellent Doctoral\nDissertation of PR China, partly by Beijing Nova Program\nand partly by Program for New Century Excellent Talents in\nUniversity.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Amazon.com.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
