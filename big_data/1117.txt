statistical approaches of natural language understanding NLU is on how to overcome the insuf\036cient co-occurrence information caused by the limited boundary of statistical approaches Researchers have long used the imparting of human knowledge into statistical approaches including de\036nition of rules and collections of hierarchy of concepts However these are dif\036cult to de\036ne even for a domain expert They are also very much people and domain dependent This study proposes a fuzzy approach to tackle these issues in a way as to provide a methodology for logical reorganizing context in order to tackle the issue of boundary limitation to create the more reasonable and understandable word association which will be referenced 
as membership degree in latter stage and to make the processes of imparting of human knowledge easier and less domain dependent The accomplishment of these tasks could be achieved through the concept of Precisiated Natural Language PNL I I NTRODUCTION Due to issues such as word synonymy and polysemy understanding of natural language NLU is semantically related and very much dependent on the sentence organization As such use of World Knowledge or human knowledge is a common assistant to automatic NLU However the apporach of how to effectively apply World Knowledge on NLU is still a challenging problem One of the major difﬁculties is how to impart machine understanding with the unbounded 
nature of human knowledge Human cognition is built upon a procedure of granulation When a particular event happens the event triggers all related memory and the brain reconstructs the knowledge pertaining to the event’s environment Unfortunately there doesn’t exist yet a powerful algorithm to mimic exactly the human way of reconstructing knowledge from previous experience The current popular approach to tackle this issue is to use frequency based measures to predict the semantic understanding given the assumption that the historical words relations remains always true in the unpredicted context However the traditional statistical approaches cannot deal completely with this issue because any statistical approach for instance 
n-gram approaches to natural language is sub-sufﬁcient This is due to the fact that the estimated parameters are based on insufﬁcient information for instance only the near neighbor’s occurrence is considered during the word frequency analysis and therefore might lead to imprecise outcome As such we propose to apply the fuzzy logic-based World Knowledge rst to reorganize the planning of the original context before using the frequency based measure to compute the semantic coefﬁcients between words The reason behind the use of fuzzy techniques instead of human-supplied lexicon and rules is intuitive In fact even a domain expert cannot provide a comprehensive lexicon 
and domain rules Fuzzy World Knowledge functions as a compensation to insufﬁciency of human-supplied lexicon so that the missing data can be compensated through the fuzzysupplied knowledge Through the tuning of human-supplied lexicon by fuzzy Word Knowledge we try to compensate for the gaps of statistical approach when applied to NLU Throughout this paper the fuzzy based World Knowledge is synonymous of Precisiated Natural Language PNL  In particular  we propose three kinds of sets of w ord knowledge to tackle the issue of insufﬁcient information discussed above The remainder of the paper is organized as follows In Section 2 the classical statistical and fuzzy approaches are 
reviewed In Section 3 we describe a novel formalism of human knowledge through three sets of knowledge which forms the basis of the proposed methodology In Section 4 we illustrate with an example to explain how to apply the proposed methodology to enhance a statistical measure to accurately compute the semantic coefﬁcients of words In Section 5 experimental results illustrate the performance of the proposed approach followed by comments and discussions Finally conclusions are given in Section 6 II O VERVIEW AND B ACKGROUND Statistical approaches are widely used today by NLU researchers For instance the corpus approach 4 has 
been the earliest language model based on a pure statistical model The assumption that underlies the theory is that a document might be represented by a hyperspace vector consisting of signiﬁcant words selected by a certain metric The major issue of the corpus approach pertains the lack of capability in tackling the difﬁculties caused by synonymy and polysemy within the English language domain as argued in Meanwhile the issue of sparse v ector representation  must also be considered In order to better understand the semantic meaning of words researchers have used the 0-7803-9158-6/05/$20.00 © 2005 IEEE The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 143 


machine readable semantic lexicons WordNet  8 Oxford Advanced Learner  10 Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English  and Funk and Wagnalls F&W Dictionary  Other semantic approaches 13 14 took advantage of knowledge from the predeﬁned syntactic patterns and semantic slots called Heuristic However the issue of how to optimize the right semantic level arises as well the issue of boundary limitation has always existed Besides the semantic approaches are inevitably geared toward the representation of static knowledge They are more suitable for deﬁning for instance the semantic ontology with static human-deﬁned semantic hierarchy However actions in other words events organized by logical relations are difﬁcult to depict by static semantic deﬁnitions In essence actions can only be dynamically described and accordingly represented by continuous states Fuzzy logic represents a good framework supporting continuous transition of states In earlier research work on fuzzy logic as applied to natural language processing researchers for instance Zadeh in focused on modelling adverb modiﬁers in natural language through fuzzy sets However this approach has its limitation as it depicts modiﬁers only In order to characterize other types of words meanings by fuzzy sets Zadeh introduced hierarchies of fuzzy concepts in Besides considering the relation between possibility and fuzzy sets Zadeh in  took adv antage of possibility of a proposition to deﬁne its corresponding fuzzy set However the previous research work was mainly limited to simple proposition transitions and focused on characterization of modiﬁers and the words with obvious distinguishing degree such as hot red and tall  This by itself cannot cope with natural sentences Other researchers for instance in 20 ha v e used a fuzzy relation system to depict semantic association through construction of a fuzzy thesaurus for a certain domain However the main issue is that the fuzzy thesaurus are in essence static so that a lexine in such static lexicons cannot dynamically adjust its original conceptual deﬁnition and relations when a new situation arises More recently Zadeh introduced the theory of fuzzy information granulation TFIG where Zadeh suggested a novel formalism for natural language processing which he called Precisiated Natural Language PNL III P ROPOSED A PPROACH The modelling of natural language  i.e free context represents the main topic of this paper An appropriate model must satisfy two basic requirements 1 enable human knowledge to translate into statistical approaches 2 rules to simplify manual annotation of the training corpus We base our modelling approach through integration of three kinds of sets of knowledge extracted from words Zadeh’s recent ndings on Epistemic Lexicon EL in Semantic pattern and Predicate dictionary as well generic rules A Predicate Dictionary In our research we believe verbs predicate are more important than nouns As such we deﬁne a dictionary particularly for the interested predicates The dictionary is differentiated from others in the sense of direction which will be used in the latter stage for construction of membership functions Some examples are listed in Table I B Epistemic Lexicon EL The words association is described by Epistemic Lexicon EL In an EL deﬁnes a granulation le xicon in a format described as EL Word  attribute=[Word fuzzy  The parameters are w ords in the language relations R between words and the attributes of words An example of granulated attribute relations in the form of EL is shown in Fig 1 where A i is the i th attribute of lexine representing a super concept and G i  is a group of granulated concepts with a fuzzy measurement In our research we adopt this deﬁnition and further update Predicate Class Assigned Words Agree agree afﬁliate ally coincide Against refuse damage cessation argue challenge Action-up boost increase bounce develop Action-down decrease reduce discourage dump fall Action-in buy import offer,proposal order Action-out disclose exclude explore export pay release TABLE I Examples for Predicate Dictionary 1n GG Attribute Granular members 1n Profitability Technology Capital Human Resource Cash / Mid Stock/ High Sales / High Manager / Mid Bio-tech / Hight e-commerce/ Mid Example Format  Lexine A A  Fig 1 An Example of Granulated Attribute Relations in the Form of Epistemic Lexicon The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 144

sentences in the original documents with the assistance of the predicate dictionary and semantic patterns Next we apply the deﬁned generic rules to adjust the parsed output depicted as reorganize the context Finally we apply a statistical tool TRUST in to compute the statistical corpus matrix Here we illustrate with an example on how this methodology enhances the system to correctly identify context Consider the sentence Beech-Nut Corp damaged its image over the sale of apple juice that turned out to be water in which the word sale is the targeted word Here we show step by step how the system correctly understands the sale drops down Procedure of Deduction Given by original deﬁnitions of the predicate dictionary and EL Against\(damage and Companyoperation\(image sale  Start

Against\(sale 004 Performance-down\(sale V R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSIONS A Results In this section we apply the statistical tool TRUST on the parsed outputs As an example we only discuss the spacial distribution of company which belongs to one of two possible concepts Buyer or Seller companies are sold  Fig 2\(a shows two different distributions of company given company belongs to Buyer or Seller before tuning tuning means applying the proposed methodology In the gure the origin denotes the central word company X-axis denotes all other words in the selected corpus due to the limits of the page only 8 words with their concepts are listed Y-axis denotes the distance between the central word company and other words on X-axis The larger the distance between company and another word the less correlated these two words circles denote the distribution of company belonging to concept Buyer and stars denote the distribution of company belonging to concept Seller For instance the gure shows before tuning company belonging to concept Buyer is more related to word board than company belonging to Seller before tuning  Fig 2\(b shows two different distributions of company given company belongs to Buyer or Seller after tuning In the gure the origin the X-axis and the Yaxis are similar to what has been deﬁned in Fig 2\(a Comparing Fig 2\(b and Fig 2\(a we discover that some distributions have changed For instance Fig 2\(b shows after tuning company belonging to concept Seller is more related to word board than company belonging to buyer which is contrary to the results shown in Fig 2\(a After re-checking the original documents we nd that this seemingly contradictory result is in accordance with human intuition when a company is being sold the decision must be passed by the director board of the sold company and accordingly the word board instead of the sold company usually appears within the context However when a company plans to takeover another company the word board seldom appears In order to more clearly understand the tuning effect on the distributions we change the views and outline the results in Fig 3 The statistical outputs by applying of the proposed methodology might be viewed as the semantic coefﬁcients of words These semantic coefﬁcients can be directly applied on construction of fuzzy membership function in the latter stage which used to be achieved by domain experts arbitrary experience The proposed approach can be also used to identify the semantic meaning of a given word word sense disambiguation Consider the sentence The juice scandal forced Beech-Nut to pay a 2  2 million ne and 7  5 million to settle a lawsuit in the domain of company-acquisition the system can accurately tell that Beech-Nut is a sold company because the tuned EL shows scandal pay ne and lawsuit are more related to a seller than a buyer Other possible applications of the proposed approach include 1 operation as an assistant to a semantic parser  e.g anaphor resolution  and 2 operation as an assistant to a syntactic parser  e.g pp attachment  B Comments and discussions The main features of the proposed methodology that makes it an efﬁcient tool for NLU can be summarized as follows 1 simplify manual annotation Human’s annotation is much more accurate than any intelligent machine However manual annotation is tedious and time consuming Even for a domain expert it is difﬁcult to outline a collection of concepts which is good enough to cover most of the corpus Besides even with the available set of concepts it is difﬁcult to assign a word to its appropriate concept\(s because the belongingness of the word is multi-valued and dynamic To tackle this issue the methodology is proposed in a way where  the issue of assigning words belongingness might be tackled through the three sets of knowledge  by using the three sets of knowledge the system dynamically differentiates words directions which will be applied on construction of membership

management-staff possible sale hard to tell TABLE IV Example of Components of Epistemic Lexicon after Tuning of magnitude depending on the corpus size However the proposed approach tackles this issue by logically reorganizing related sentences together no matter how far away these sentences are from each other For instance according to the word’s direction deﬁned by predicate dictionary and lexine’s attributes deﬁned by EL the generic rules reasonably connects sentences which have the same subject and direction 4 free from decision rules The decision rules are the pivot component for both statistical and fuzzy approaches However the decision rules are difﬁcult to discover for statistical approaches and require a great deal of domain knowledge for fuzzy approaches In this paper we solve such issue by simply deﬁning 5 generic rules and the experiment shows they are satisfactory What is more important is that they are less domain dependent On the other hand the proposed approach is still domain dependent in some sense Indeed for each domain we have to re-deﬁne EL concepts and semantic patterns In practice it is preferable to constrain the technique to a narrowly deﬁned domain and make use of a large text corpus VI C ONCLUSION In this paper a fundamental research on how to formalize human knowledge through three sets of knowledge is thoroughly discussed The proposed work can either tackle issues challenging the traditional statistical approaches such as how to overcome the insufﬁcient co-occurrence information caused by the limited window size or strengthen machines the capability to impart human knowledge into statistical approaches Based on this research the experiment is also presented to demonstrate the potential capabilities in tackling issues existing in traditional statistical measures and classic fuzzy approaches The results presented indicate that the use of proposed approach enhances the obtained words semantic coefﬁcients Although the proposed approach decreases the domain experts impact on the nal results it is still necessary to apply domain knowledge to help the approach more accurately depict the semantic relations between concepts and words In order to make the approach compatible to multi-domain in future research work we will focus on expanding the unique topic domain to more complex ones Besides we will explore how to construct membership function based on words semantic coefﬁcients through the proposed approach in our future research work R EFERENCES  L Zadeh T o w ard a theory of fuzzy information granulation and its

Scalability with the transaction number of DB 5. Conclusions In the real world, databases are periodically and continually updated.  Therefore, mining must be repeated Valid patterns and rules must to be efficiently generated Incremental mining must usually involve the original database and the new added transactions.  Scanning the original database is very expensive, so the proposed method outperforms others by avoiding the rescanning of the original database This investigation has presented a new method, NFUP for incremental mining.  NFUP does not require the rescanning of the original database and can determine new frequent itemsets at the latest time intervals.  The proposed method uses information available from a following partition to avoid the rescanning of the original database; it requires only the incremental database to be scanned.  In reality, the transaction number of the incremental database is very small in contrast to the original database.  The running time of NFUP rises almost in direct proportion with the transaction number of the incremental database Accordingly, NFUP is suited frequently updated databases In the future, the authors will consider the extension of the NFUP algorithm to sequence rules References  R.

CBA and Neural Networks at 1% confidence level while they are all significantly better than C4.5 decision tree. Taking the interpretability of classification model into account, these two adapted CBA algorithm seem to be appropriate choices for credit scoring because they generated much more compact decision lists \(less sequential rules original CBA. They therefore favour the well-known Occam  s Razor theory and are more suitable for decision makers to understand. A deeper insight into the rules structures shows that original CBA and adapted CBA 1 both focus on generating classification rules that predict good clients \(with bad clients as the default class implication, numerous rules with high confidence but low support have lower ranks than they are in original CBA. These rules are finally discarded since they are not fired by any training samples, which are matched by these rules with higher intensity of implications thus making the decision lists generated by adapted CBA 1 more compact. Adapted CBA 2 mainly mines these classification rules for bad clients \(with good clients as the default class compact rule sets Original CBA Adapted CBA1 Adapted CBA2 C45 NN dataset accuracy no. of rules accuracy num. of rules accuracy no. of rules accuracy accuracy 1 Austr 85.65% 130.5 86.52% 26.4 86.96% 12.4 86.52% 85.07 2 Germ 73.30% 134 74.40% 56.5 73.20% 19.7 72.40% 74.90 3 Bene 72.92% 393 72.30% 186 73.51% 51 70.21% 72.63 Table 2.

Conclusion Intensity of implication is proposed in the beginning as an interestingness measure for association rules Another novel interestingness measure called dilated chi-square is designed by us to reveal the statistical interdependence between the antecedents and consequents of association rules We then adapt CBA algorithm, which can be used to build classifiers based on class association rules, by coupling it with intensity of implication and dilated chi-square respectively. More concretely, Intensity of implication \(or dilated chi-square primary criterion to rank class association rules at the first step of the database coverage pruning procedure in CBA algorithm. Experiments on three credit scoring datasets proved that these two adapted algorithms compared with original CBA, classical C4.5 decision tree and neural network, achieve satisfactory performance and generates classifiers much more compact than CBA 6.

absolute values. The results can vary on other computers. But it can be guaranteed that performance ratio of the algorithms will remain the same After making the comparisons with sample data, we came to the conclusion that PD algorithm performs significantly better than the other two especially with larger datasets. PD outperforms DCP and PIP regarding running time. On the other hand, since PD reduces the dataset, mining time does not necessary increase as the number of transactions increases and experiments reveals that PD has better scalability than DCP and PIP. So, PD has the ability to handle the large data mine in practical field like market basket analysis and medical report documents mining 5. References 1] R. Agrawal and R.

tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned.

Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type.

Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
