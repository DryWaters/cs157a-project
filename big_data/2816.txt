R. CHINA Tel /Fax: 15871828937/ \(86\-27-87543992    E-mail: sean0406@126.com  Abstract Flood simulation and forecasting is a hot topic of flood disaster research. DEM as the basic data plays a crucial role in the field. High resolution grid DEM data is able to supply exact terrain model to this work, but it brings on a bothering problem that the data is too big to reduce running efficiency in computer Facing the issue, the paper tries to solve the problem of high resolution DEM data’s processing and transferring. A new flood simulation method is introduced first. It brings a simple and efficient simulate method to simulate flood on high resolution DEM data. And then, a WebGIS based system is designed as flood simulation function’s running platform. Advanced WebGIS technologies lead an efficient transferring way to DEM data and other relative images Keywords-DEM; flood simulation; system structure I  I NTRODUCTION  Flood is a body of water that covers normally dry land Most floods are harmful. They may destroy homes and other property and even carry off the topsoil, leaving the land barren. Sudden and violent floods, which leave people little time to prepare, may bring huge losses. Rivers, lakes, or seas may flood the land. River floods are more common, though lake and seacoast floods can be more serious. So that, the flood simulation and forecasting is an important topic for human being, especially for who lives in the city nearby water resource With the development of hydrology, computer science remote sensing, GIS and others technologies, there are many new methods and advanced concepts using to simulate and forecast flood for people. But most of them are aim at largescale region, such as a big river valley, server provinces and so on In fact, many flood disaster are occur at one or more places on the embankment. If the occur place near the city or downtown, it will lead a terrible disaster to these local people and their homeland. For the reason, downtown flood disaster simulation is another hot aspect On the other hand, DEM data is foundation of the flood simulation. As we know, downtown flood disaster simulation need high resolution grid data as data base, because it is able to supply exact terrain model to simulate accurately flood result But high resolution grid data lead to a bothering problem that the data is too big to reduce running efficiency in computer The paper tries to solve the problem of high resolution DEM data’s processing and transferring. A new flood simulation method is introduced first. It brings a new and efficient simulate method to simulate flood on high resolution DEM data. And then, a WebGIS based system structure is designed for flood simulation function’s running, advanced web technology are lead an efficient transferring and management way to DEM data and other related images II  A LGORITHM OF FLOOD SIMULATION  A  Research background Flood disaster always come form two reasons. The first is rainstorm. In this situation, water is collected by all downfold wholly raining region’s water levels are almost the same. So we called it “no-source flood”. Based on the principle, it is easy to simulate that just used a custom height plane to cover DEM 4  The other flood reason is by break dam or overflow from water source \(e.g.: River, sea, etc.\. Water moves from the accident place and diffuses to aro und place. It is called “source flood”. The method of the flood region confirmed is different to the first situation. It is a complex process that too many factors have to be considered, such as terrain, flux, drain and so on. Aim at this situation, the paper well discus more at later section B  Algorithm principle  According to the basic principle of flood, the paper focuses on the simulation of the “source flood”. Through the submergence phenomenon, we can find that water’s moving is coming form source point. The moving track likes a loop diffusing one circle after another \(as Figure.1\.  It is the basic principle of the “source flood”. On the other side, the expansion operation of mathematical morphology leads an available idea to flood simulation. Water’s moving is able to be described by theory of mathematical morphology

 Therefore, learn from the expansion operation of mathematical morphology and basic principle of flood, based on the DEM data’s characteristics, a new flood edge detection method, “Ring” research method are designed. On the grid format of DEM data, the method purposes to simulate the flood diffusing. Point searching begins at the central point accident point\ and the first circle is composed of the 8neighbour points around that. Finished the first circle’s searching and judgment, the second circle’ searching is beginning in a sequence. The second circle contains the points surrounding the first circle. In this order, the “Ring” method is implemented as the figure.2  With the searching way, the second research part is how to judge the point is flooded or not. As we know, water move need two necessary conditions: 1.The region have to connect to flooded area. 2. The region is lower than connective flooded point’s water level. So that, the flood point judgment has to satisfy the two necessary conditions On the grid format DEM data, terrain is described as regular and dispersal units. So that, when judging one point flood or not, we have to get two values: the first is the unknown point’s elevation which gets from DEM and the second values are connective points’ flood values. These values are the water level of the connective flooded points which come from former result. Based on the searching method, there are four neighborhood points value must to be got. As the figure.2, to judge unknown point A, we need to get he A’s around 4 relative points’ values from result array According to the 4 connective points’ values, if the A’s elevation is lower than the minimum of the 4 flooded points water level, A is able to be judged as flooded point. But if the 4 points do not flood yet or they are all lower than its elevation, the point is not able to be flooded C  Algorithm design As the discussing and analyzing to the basic principle of Ring” method above, detailed application flow is design as follow 1  Read DEM data to memory as an array. Register the location of accident point in the array 2  With input parameters, such as time, water flux and other necessary flood parameters, compute the maximum flood region in flood model. The maximum flood region limit maximum search circle number 3  Get the correlative points’ value as contrast array from former circle 4  According to the “Ring” method, search point from 1 to maximum circle and judge every point by contrast array 5  Limit the searching region by maximum searching region. If all points are judged, finish the program In the practice application, there are two mainly problems come out. The first is high resolution grid data can supply exact terrain model, but the data lead to a bothering problem that the data is too big to reduce the efficiency in computer. In the research, the flood simulation is aim at downtown region so high resolution grid data are necessary. To address the problem of large data quantity, partial-read method is chosen As we know that, flood simulation computing do not need all DEM data. Based on that, when get maximum region form flood model’s computing, circum-rectangle of maximum region can be get also. In this way, large DEM data separate to two parts by circum-rectangle, one is available part which input to memory for processing, and the other part is useless part which is out of circum-rectangle and do not need to input Because of the regular structure of DEM, partial-read method is easy to implement The second problem is after once single “Ring” method processing, many error regions exist, which are the points that should be flooded but not register on the result. Facing the problem, a modify function has to be designed in the program The modify function’s implement is based on the “Ring method also. It is running after first “Ring” searching. After the flood simulation compute, first step of modify function is to find error edge points. Edge points are the unflooded points whose 8-neighbour exist one or more flooded point in the flood result. So the error edge point is one edge point which should be flooded but not. The second step is to use “Ring method function to process again with the error edge point as central point. Repeat above two step until there are no error edge point. After modify function process, there are no error point exit on the result III  S YSTEM STRUCTURE  A  system design In recent years, with Internet growing in unimaginable speed and won the general popularity around the world WebGIS, a new technology of information management based on web, have been widely adopted by many fields. There are two obvious characteristics belong to the WebGIS. One side WebGIS, could deal with large quantity of data and supply advanced information management service the same as general GIS 1 the other side, as the Internet can spread information to a multitude of users, WebGIS is available to a wider range of public users though the Internet 3 On the other hand, nicer system structure design lead to high-speed data transfer and high-performance network server which should support the  Figure.1 sketch map  Figure.2 Searching way of “Ring” method

Web-GIS based flood simulation and information management system. In addition, with the fast development of modern network technology, data transfer won’t be an obstacle anymore in the near future   According to the analysis of technical and application characteristics, the flood simulation and information management system is designed based on web-GIS. It is able to satisfy requirements of data’s transferring and users facility. B/S architecture is adopted as basic framework by system. \(Contrasting to Client/Server \(C/S\ B/S is more flexible and expandable and is easier to maintain, moreover, it can make the information more open to the public 4 The system selects the product ArcServer 9.2 and ArcSDE 9.1 of the ESRI Company as basis development platform and Visual stdio.NET \(.NET\ as development tool The architecture of the information management system is designed according to the multi-tier middleware mode. It is composed of four tiers: data tier, data service tier, web server tier and browser tier. \(Figure.3 Browser Tier In the structure, browser tier is an interface of system to users by browsers. With friendly interface, it is a flexible interaction platform between users and system. Facing the users, browser tier receives requests and return result by pages Browser Tier actions are handled by JavaScript functions Each Client Tool Action on the map and page layout controls such as Circle, Drag Image, and Drag Rectangle, calls a particular JavaScript function. It is the responsibility of the JavaScript function once executed to post back to the control to execute the server-side action Web server tier The tier is composed of web server application and web service. Web server application contains all applications of system modules which are implemented by web application development framework \(ADF\of .NET. Web service is a set of functionality located on a Web server whose methods and properties can be accessed over the Internet. The Web service class methods return values packaged as Extensible Markup Language \(XML\ documents; therefore any application capable of reading XML can call the Web service methods and use the results Data Service tier Data service tier is a service to manager data of system. The functions includes: data accessing, data organization, data security and server-object management Data tier Data tier is used for manage and maintain the spatial data \(DEM, DOM, etc.\ and attribute data by using large database, and data access component access the distributed data resource through ArcSDE and ODBC  Figure.3 System architecture B  Data transferring technology As the Figure.3 illustrated, the former three tiers belong to server side and browser tier belong to client side. Through the Internet, client-side and server-side are connected mainly by Hypertext Markup Language \(HTML\ML and Simple Object Access Protocol \(SOAP\. HTML is the predominant markup language for the creation of web pages. It provides a means to describe the structure of text-based information in a document. SOAP, is a protocol for exchanging XML-based messages over computer networks. It standardizes the way a Web service communicates with a client and allows programs written in different languages and on different platforms to be compatible with each other. SOAP brings together XML and Hypertext Transfer Protocol \(HTTP\ by setting protocols for how Web services and their clients communicate with each other. Within a SOAP framework, a client sends a request in XML over HTTP to the Web service, which, in return, sends a response in XML In the structure, User’s requests are sent to web server from Internet browser program by HTML and SOAP. Then, the application programs of web server are running to deal with the requests and transfer the data requests to data service Accessing data by ODBC or ArcSDE, data service processes the data requests and supports the server application to make a quick response and sent the result back to the server. So that users get the result from browsers after refreshing the page In this way, flood simulation result pictures are transferred by internet easily. Not only flood result pictures, but also all other processed result are able to transfer by this structure IV  S YSTEM DEMONSTRATE  A  Experiment data Experiment data contain: DEM data, region: QiShi segment of Foshan levee; resolution: 2m, cover region area: 4 km2 DOM data, region: QiShi segment of Foshan levee resolution: 1m, cover region area: 4 km2. \(As figure.4\.Data supplied by Foshan Urban Geographic Information Center On the experiment region, the red point means accident place   Figure.4 DOM region

B  Result demonstrate In the webpage of the client side, initialization parameters are custom by users. In the experiment, parameters set like that: flux: 5m3/s, time: 15 min  As the figure.5, it is the result of flood simulation on the experiment data. On the result page, it is only a result photo instead of DEM and DOM data form server, so that it need less transfer quantity than original data V  C ONCLUSION  As the introducing of the paper, the system structure and flood method are fit to DEM data’s application. After the experiment and many times test, it proves performance well. It is efficiency and practical design for flood simulation’s application However, it should be pointed that there are also many other problems exist in the flood simulation system. How to improve the veracity and efficiency and how to dear with 3D operation in the internet are two mainly keystones of future research A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  The study is financially supported by National basic research program of China \(No. 2007CB714107 Thanks for data supported by Foshan Urban Geographic Information Center R EFERENCES   1  Dang Anrong, “Study on sharing digital urban planning information based on WebGIS”, Journal Tsinghua University, Beijing. 2006 2  Yang Jianyu, Ming Dongping, Zhang Xiaodong and Huang Haitao. “A WEBGIS based command control system for forest fire figurehting Journal, Department of Information Management, College of Information & Electronic Engineering, China, 2006 3  Xia Zhang, Deren Li, Xinyan Zhu, and Nengcheng Chen, “Systematic plan of building Web Geographic Information System based on ActiveX contro”, Journal, Wuhan university, Wuhan. 2006 4  DING Zhixiong, LI Jiren, LI Lin. “Method for flood submergence analysis based on GIS grid model” Journal.

For each terms used in the formulae of the disclosure policies, the Requester sends the corresponding disclosure policies. The same procedure is performed by the Controller on the terms in the formulae sent it by the Requester. Such operations are iteratively repeated until a set of terms is found with no disclosure policies associated and granting the disclosure of further terms up to the disclosure of the initial resource R If such set is no found, the negotiation terminates with a failure. The state of a peer keeps track of which resources the peer makes available to other peers, and whether the peer has released such resources. Also the state includes the identifies of the resources that the peer has requested from other peers, and whether the peer has obtained them Definition 5.2 \(Peer State A state of a peer p is a tuple  11 2 2     puu SRaRa Ra where a pair  ii Ra denotes the fact that resource R i has been associated to action a i  where a i takes values over the set requested  available  released  received  request  The satisfaction of a formula is evaluated respect with a peer state. A formula is satisfied in a peer state if the resources to which a formula applies are available in that state and if the resources’ attributes meet the conditions in the formula Definition 5.3 \(Formula satisfiability Given a formula 1   u tt we say that holds at Sp iff 1 There is a tuple of the form  i R available for each resource R i to which 1   u tt applies 1 2 For each resource R i the attribute conditions specified by the corresponding term t i in are satisfied by ‘s attribute values in AttrSet  g Weak assured formulae enforcement If a formula is denoted as weak is verified by checking the validity of the credential associated to the terms of the formula. That may mean checking the validity of X.509 certificates or of signed advertisement, depending on the environment of the negotiation h Strong assured formulae enforcement If a formula is denoted as strong the simple verification of the credential representing it, is not enough. That type of verification 1 That is, all the resource to which the formula applies are available in S p  requires that the actual presence of the resource is periodically verified. The frequency of the verification can be set by p at its discretion i Level of disclosure If the reply to the initial request of the resource R is of the form 12     u t Rt t where  the formula 12 1 2    uu t tttt t  it is possible for the initial requester to provide a subset of terms contained in in order to obtain at least a subset of the atomic resources composing R that the provider define as appropriate for the disclosured terms. The requester rebate with the rebate formula 12     k  constructed as described before. If the controller of the resource R accepts the offered terms as enough to disclosure the resource, it replies with a disclosure policy of the form 1    l k R where l R is the level of disclosure associated by the controller with the offered terms 1  k  That process is called level negotiation To be able to identify the level associate to a given subset of terms, we need to define some tools function Definition 5.4 \(Term evaluation function A term evaluation function is a function defined as follows  wT  Where T is the set of terms known by a party. Such function associates to each term t a value n expressing the importance” each party associate with the term t  Definition 5.5 \(Level of disclosure threshold function A level of disclosure threshold function is a function defined as follows  sL  Where L is a set of all disclosure levels. Such function associates a value to each disclosure level. The meaning of such association is to define a threshold above which the level can be disclosured. An example of the usage of what have just been described is shown in Ex. 5.4 Example 5.4 Let the attach tree shown in Fig. 1 be the resource controlled by a party called Controller C party called Requester R  R sends to C a request of the form Library  Type=”4  C replies with the disclosure policy related to Library  Type=”4  it be Library  Type=”4  1234     tt t t where the formula 1234 1 2 3 4     tt tt t t t t   R doesn’t own t 2 and t 3 or doesn’t want to disclose them to C it replies with the rebate formula 14 1 4   tt t t Following Fig.3 C identify as R 2 according to Example 5.2, the appropriate level of disclosure for the terms offered by R It replies with the new resource “requested” and the new associated disclosure policy Library  Type=”4   14   tt where 14 1 4   tt t t If C accept to access the offered level of disclosure over the resource R it replies with the disclosure policies associated to the involved terms. If it refuses it can try to offer more less terms or give up with the negotiation This is a conservative extension of the original language in the sense that, if there is no match between the disclosured 


policies in X RNL, then the negotiation fails, while in the newly proposed language it is possible to re-negotiate the originally requested resource Fig. 3.  Identifies the disclosure level for the terms offered by the counter-party VI C ONCLUSIONS The language described previously, satisfies the requirements presented in Section II for Critical Infrastructure Information Sharing Systems. In fact, such negotiation language enables to express exchange policies and constraints, introducing formal mechanisms allowing to assign different level of “trust” to the actors of the sharing network, on the basis of the required information. Moreover it allows to model the concept of partial information sharing i.e. the possibility to release only portions of a target information, on the basis of the identity and of he properties of the requesting actor.  By adopting such language it is possible to create a distribute network of peer “layered and clusterized” according to different kinds of characteristics They can freely and securely exchange information about C.I preserving at the same time the strong constraints related to the confidentiality of such information. Fig. 4 shows for example the case described in Section II: the peers are organized into “Country clusters”; they can negotiate and exchange directly some information with members of the same or different cluster, and indirectly by leaving the negotiation task to the Government Peers. The present work leaves obviously opened some questions which are typical and not definitively solved in the information sharing world I\the owner of a released information loses any control over the released copy, i.e. he cannot force the actor which receives the information to apply the same distribution criteria on such information while requested to distribute it by a third actor. \(II\ is, at the moment, prone to Data-Mining analysis attacks. In fact by using such techniques, could be possible for a malicious actor, to use information obtained “legally” in order to guess information for which he has not any access right Fig. 4.  High level Information Exchange Network schema The first problem could be solved for example by implementing some “reputation mechanism”, while for the second, some Statistical disclosure control and Privacy Preserving Data Mining mechanisms can be identified and applied. We plan for the future, to address such issues Moreover, we plan to implement a fully working peer-to-peer prototype of the present architecture, in order to conduct an extensive on field working test R EFERENCES  E.

  9 corrections. With several concurrent development processes, ops personnel could be members of more than one virtual team simultaneously. Various strategies such as sequence specific email aliases and automated software configuration were devel oped to ease confusion from sequence to sequence Aftermarket and SOP Update 227Since the initial round of integration and implementation was begun two years before reaching Saturn, a two-step update phase was included to incorporate new discoveries, respond to instrument performance changes, and design to the latest navigation ephemerides. The record of planned activities from SOP was retained in the CIMS database. During Aftermarket, the previous integration was revisited and revised. SOP Update during which the commanding for pointing and for management of shared resources such as power and data volume was reworked and revalidated, followed Aftermarket Sequencing 227 The final sequence development phase Science and Sequence Update Process \(SSUP began 10 weeks before start of execu tion. The commanding carried forward from SOPU received its final refinements and validation. Instrument internal commanding was added during this stage of development, expanding the roster of participants as the focus shifted from science design to instrument operation. The vector commands for attitude control were also generated and merged into the sequence providing the first realistic estimate of sequence size Since the sequence contains tens of thousands of commands, ensuring its validity was laborious. Because the command sequence represents merged commanding from each of the instruments a nd from each of the spacecraft subsystems, configuration ma nagement was required to insure that all parties were aware of changes potentially impacting them and that no changes were made without appropriate validation. Late in this stage of development changes were restricted to those related to maintaining flight assets health and safety. Novel or particularly complex activities were simulated in one or more of the available testbeds. The highest fide lity modeling was accomplished with a hardware-in-the-loop simulator, the Integrated Test Laboratory \(ITL\with engineering versions of the flight processors and flight software the same as on-board the spacecraft Over the lengthy time to plan the activities and develop the commands, the precise timing of geometric opportunities sometimes shifted. Several constructs to accommodate those shifts were introduced. In the one employed during SSUP called a ground movable block, a cluster of observations was shifted together within a window to reflect a timing change in a key event such as closest approach to a body Execution 227Uplink of the background sequence and the loads of instrument expanded blocks required several DSN passes since the files were large and had to be verified once on board. Days that included other Earth-pointed activity such as OTMs were avoided. This expanded the overlap of the old and new background sequences over enough days that careful memory management was required to fit both in onboard memory. In some cases, the new sequence was too large and needed to be split in to two pieces with the second uplinked as the first piece neared completion Once the sequence was executi ng, additional real-time commands and mini-sequences were uplinked for timing adjustments, OTMs, and other engineering activities requiring state verification be fore issuance. Instrument internal commands could be also be uplinked directly without involvement of the sequence team at JPL using the Automated Sequence Processor \(ASP During execution, there were two ways of accommodating late changes to timing or geometry. One, a live moveable block, was similar to the ground version except that the size of the timing shift was not determined until after the sequence had begun executing. The other, called a live vector update, redirected the pointing in inertial space by redefining the vectors that control attitude. Although this was a straightforward mechanism for altering pointing in response to later, better knowledge of spacecraft position the process took several days and considerable effort. So extensive analysis was require d to carefully place potential updates where they could be most effective 6  L ESSONS L EARNED  Understanding the operational challenges to maximizing Cassini science return and the successful techniques employed in overcoming those challenges should be of value to other deep space science missions, including the next Outer Planets flagship mission. Some of the lessons cover design decisions, both those that facilitated operations and should be carried forward for future consideration and those that complicated operations and should be avoided Others reflect ways in which flight experience differed from expectations. The discussion with resulting recommendations for future missions is divided into three categories: flight system, ground system, and programmatic Flight System Operational modes 227 Spacecraft operational modes were used to define a limited number of power mode states for the instruments and engineering subsystems. The states were developed in conjunction with project science and the engineering office to enable synergistic and cooperative science data collection. The use of operational modes eliminated the need to perform unique thermal modeling on a sequence-by-sequence basis. The thermal and power configurations for each of th e limited number of operational modes were fully tested only once for operational use. As such, there was no need to va lidate and check the power and 


  10 thermal state of the spacecraft during sequence development. However, on a very limited number of occasions, unique power m odes were necessary to accomplish the science data acquisition plan. In these situations, thermal modeling was necessary during sequence development. The a priori restriction on the use of unique power modes was limited to 5% of the total power modes used throughout the mission. In reality, the operational experience was about 1 Telemetry Modes 227 The volume of science data from the instrument is a function of the science data pickup rates specified for each instrument The science instruments can easily exceed the total bandwid th capabilities for the flight system, so the maximum data pickup rates need to be limited depending on the acquisition of the science plan The Cassini mission restricted th e instrument data rates by developing a limited number of telemetry modes where the maximum data pickup rate for each instrument is specified Project science worked with the science teams to develop the data pickup rate for each telemetry mode based on the synergistic science data collection Memory Management 227 The on-board memory management for Cassini significantly simplifies the managing of backgrounds seque nces and mini-sequences The flight software has the capability to run 64 different programs \(sequence, delayed action commands, etc once. This significantly simplifies the development and coordination required for the live updates and OTM processes. Also, the on-board memory management allows for sequences that are too large to fit in the on-board memory to be split into pieces Guidance and Control 227 The AACS subsystem uses an Internal Vector Propagation \(IVP\for pointing the spacecraft at the science targets of interest. The ephemerides for the spacecraft and the various science targets are stored as polynomial vectors and propagated on board the spacecraft for easy retrieval a nd updating. This approach significantly simplifies the ability to perform live pointing vector updates during sequence execution when the spacecraft knowledge to better known. An update to a single vector, or a couple of vectors is all that is needed to correctly target upcoming science observations Command and Data Handling 227 The Command and Data Subsystem \(CDS features that simplified operations. Among these were onboard science instrument data policing, ability to remove bad solid-state recorder \(SSR\odules, and a variety of onboard science modules that control science pointing commands \(e.g., limb scans, ring tracking, mosaics\and their corresponding instrument triggers. One of the more powerful capabilities on-board th e spacecraft was the data policing, which controls the amount of science instrument data that can be recorded on-board the solid state \(SSR recorder. Once data volume wa s allocated to the science instrument teams on a daily basis in the planning process data policing prevented any team from using more data than allocated if compression or instrument internal commanding goes awry. This eliminates any need for ground intervention to prevent SSR overruns during sequence execution High-priority science playback 227 Insuring receipt of highpriority science data in the event of a DSN station problem requires a priori commanding in the background sequence for dual, playbacks of this data. This requires a considerable amount of planning and SSR pointer management and commanding to achieve the protection of this data. A filebased SSR, and/or a CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP capability would have simplifie d the redundant playback of high-priority science data No Scan Platform 227 The lack of a scan platform significantly increased the operations complexity of the mission. Without a scan platform the pointing of the optical remote sensing instruments was coupled with the pointing of the fields and particles instruments. This more than doubled the competition for th e spacecraft pointing. In addition, the total number of pointing constraints \(radiators and boresights\ncreased, dramatically reducing the amount of the 4 002 steradians of the celestial sphere that is available for spacecraft pointing. Th is required significant negotiations of the spacecraft attitude, both primary and secondary, during the science integration and implementation process Navigation 227 The Cassini spacecraft is navigated to a specific B\267T and B\267R for each targeted flyby Fixing the targeted flyby tie points increased the overall delta-V required to fly the mission but significantly simplified the science operations involved with planning the science observations taken with 261 30 minutes from closest approach. The trajectory was allowed to deviate between the targeted flyby tie-points, which required pointing vector updates for science observations outside of the targeted flyby \(see Guidance and Control above for a discussion of live pointing vector updates Another simplified operational approach used by Cassini is the just-in-time development of the Orbit Trim Maneuvers OTMs\e OTMs are built using mini-sequences that are overlaid and executed during the earth-pointed downlink periods planned in the background sequence Ground System  Science Operations System 227 A critical planning tool used to enable distributed operations was the Cassini Information Management System \(CIMS\This tool uses a web-based interface to the Cassini database that contains the current state of the integrated scien ce and engineering plan. CIMS is used throughout the sequencing life cycle on the mission from initial planning through execution. This system allowed the science instrument teams from around the world 


  11 to request, review, and propose changes to the current state of the science plan Distributed Operations 227 Cassini distributed all aspects of the instrument operations to the science teams. Science Teams were required to develop the spacecraft commanding for pointing the spacecraft. Th is significantly complicated the interfaces and coordination required by the JPL science and sequencing teams. The distribution of internal instrument commanding and monitoring instrument health and safety worked well. Dedicated full-time operations personnel were required at all instrument sites. The liaison between the distributed sites and JPL required definition of a strong JPL Investigation Scientist \(i.e., Experiment Representative\le Distributed operations is a two-edged sword. Scientists personally worked operations and were better able to optimize for their science objectives. Their insight provided the feedback necessary to quickly respond to science discoveries in the science selection and uplink processes This allowed the operations team to capitalize on truly extraordinary opportunities to a degree not thought possible However, this was at the cost of doing science analysis and publishing science results Software Development 227 The Cassini mission deferred most of its ground software development until post launch. In fact, considerable effort was spent accelerating the development of the tools required to plan the Jupiter flyby observations in 2001. For the start of the science integration for Cassini\222s prime mission, many of the ground software planning tools were immature or unavailable. To compensate, homegrown tool development occurred at the instrument sites and within science planning. System engineering of these types of ground software tools was lacking. A better paradigm would have been to develop the operations and ground system\222s architecture, requirements models, and software to a level sufficient to support operations pre-launch. Sufficient project resources needed to be applied to Phase B/C/D development. The science planning tools should be developed to a sufficient level during these phases such that th ey can be used as part of evaluating the ground and flight system requirements and capabilities. Based on this evaluation, refinements could be made during cruise and throughout the mission to the unified ground and flight system architecture and software requirements Programmatic  Project Science 227The orbiter consists of 8 Principal Investigator \(PI\struments and 4 Facility Instrument with corresponding Team Leads. In a ddition, there are 5 different science discipline teams: Rings, Saturn, Titan, Icy Satellites and Magnetosphere. The Project Science leader ship needed to be highly involved in the tactical and strategic science planning activities. The consensus building culture used on Cassini was time consuming. The Project Science support staff should be funded adequately to allow the Project Scientist to participate in the integration process. Clear Project Science guidelines are very helpful Instruments 227 Instrument Flight Rule development must be mature pre-launch. Instruments should be designed to minimize impacts on the operations of the other instruments, e.g., radiator placement. Data compression internal to instruments is vital. For Cassini, the science instruments had internal sequencing memory for storing instrument commanding for upcoming sequence. This allowed the science teams th e ability to send real-time noninteractive instrument commands that bypass the sequencing process by using the Automated Sequence Processor \(ASP  In-flight Testing 227 The targeted gravity assist flybys provided a unique opportunity to exercise the ground system on realistic science data acquisition scenarios that simulates the operational environment during the Tour phase of the prime mission. This also had the advantage of providing the science instrument teams an opportunity to acquire useful science data for the purposes of instrument checkout and science data analysis. The in-flight exercises should use the processes, procedures, software, and ground system capabilities in the same manner, to the extent possible, as will be used during Tour and Orbital operations The entire flight team \(mission planning, science planning sequencing, spacecraft, naviga tion, and science teams should be fully engaged to provide the maximum benefit to the Project 7  C ONCLUSION  Even though Cassini was a NASA flagship mission maximizing the science return was a challenge to science planning operations. Decisions aimed at saving both prelaunch and operations costs added considerable complexity to both the spacecraft and the ground system. Among the key ones were removing the scan platform, opting for distributed operations rather than co-location, and delaying development of some flight software and most of the ground system until after launch Understanding the operational challenges to maximizing Cassini science return and the successful techniques employed to overcome those challenges as presented in this paper should be of value to other deep space science missions.  Future missions should carefully consider the following advice 200  Pay careful attention to operational scenarios in development cost saving decisions, both spacecraft and ground. Additional, more sophisticated commanding constructs may be required in operations to compensate for lack of spacecraft capabilities. Ground management of stressed or

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
