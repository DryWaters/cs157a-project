   Abstract Integrating wind power increases the load variation and the reserve requirements for contingencies due to its intermittent nature. Conventional generation can obtain capacity credit because they can produce “firm” power during the peak load demand time when utilities are especially concerned about the wind power availability. As wind power is intermittent it is normally given zero or small capacity credit. In this paper, the wind availability and capacity credit for multiple wind farms distributed in Wyoming are analyzed based on actual wind data 
Considering multiple wind farms as part of one big wind farm distributed over a large area can decrease the wind power variation and increase the capacity credits. As the method used here to calculate capacity credit is the same one used by electric utilities, the potential for awarding more capacity credit to multiple wind farms is very good  Index Terms Capacity credit for wind, wind power availability, wind power correlation and variation I.

The main concern about wind power is that there is not enough spinning reserve in the system when wind stop blowing, which may result in black out in high wind power penetration cases

However 
wind turbines are different from them because input wind speed is not controllable as steam or water flow. The output of wind turbines follow the wind speed when the wind speed is between the cut-in and nominal speed of the wind turbines Therefore more reserve capacity is needed when more wind turbines are integrated into the power system. Reference [3  reviewed some analytic and utility case studies cases on the impacts of wind power on existing power systems. There was not a definite conclusion given in [3  ho w e ve r  i t  sho w e d t h a t  the integration costs increases with size as integrating wind 
power requires more reserve. The cost becomes more with higher penetration The availability of wind power during peak load demand hours is of more concern to the system operators than that of the off-peak hours. The load demand curves were drawn using MISO’s hourly actual load in Fig h o w s a t y pi cal summer daily load curve of Midwest Independent System Operation \(MISO\ on July 18, 2007. The load demand increases during the morning hours and reaches the peak in the afternoon at about 4pm as indicated by “A” in Fig.2. It is worth noting that during morning hours shown as “B”, or late 
night hours shown as “C”, the operating utilities have plenty of surplus generation available to take care of any reduction in wind generation. This is because of the fact that the utilities are prepared, based on their day-ahead or week-ahead generation scheduling, to satisfy this day’s peak demand of A”. During the peak demand time, more generation resources are needed to balance the load demand and the system reserve requirements for contingencies. All the units are processed into service during these times including very high incremental cost peaking units. Therefore, much availability of wind power during the peak demand time is more valuable 
than at other times. As a result, the utilities award capacity credit for the firm output of generation resources which they can use at peak hours. However, wind power is intermittent and awarded zero or very small capacity credit by the utilities It is extremely valuable financially for the wind farms to increase their capacity credit Estimation of Wind Power Availability and Capacity Credit for Multiple Wind Farms Yi Zhang Student Member, IEEE and Sadrul Ula Senior Member, IEEE  T

W IND D ATA A CQUISITION  One of the major challenges of wind power availability analysis is the lack of reliable wind data. Over the last four years, the University of Wyoming Electric Motor Training Testing Center has installed more than 30 wind measurement towers in the state of Wyoming and Nebraska. They covered a very large area of eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska The locations used for this study are shown in Fig. 3. The distance between two locations is 300 km. The data were collected from April 1 st 2006 to March 31 st 2009. The data include the wind speeds at 60 meters, 50 meters, and 40 meters, the wind directions at 60 meters and 50 meters, and the temperatures at ground level. The quality of wind data captured by the data loggers used in this paper is over 98 good. The data were averaged and recorded by the data loggers every 10 minutes. The time of data loggers at different locations were set via cell phones and watches. The time error of each location is estimated to be 1 or 2 minutes. The mean wind speed in summer \(May 1 to October 31\d winter November 1 to April 30\d the potential MW capacity of each location are shown in Table I  TABLE  I W IND D ATA AND P OTENTIAL C APACITY  Site Summer Average Wind Speed \(m/s Winter Average Wind Speed \(m/s Summer Standard Deviation Winter Standard Deviation Capacity MW A 6.73 9.17 3.36 4.55 30 B 6.32 8.07 3.50 4.08 30   Fig. 3 Wind measurement locations in Wyoming and Nebraska  III.  W IND P OWER A VAILABILITY  For this study, let us assume no scheduled outage or maintenance in the wind farms. The generation only depends on the local wind speed, i.e., the wind turbines will produce electricity if wind speed is between the wind turbines’ cut-in and cut-out speeds. The output of wind turbines will follow their power curves. The wind turbines used in this paper are GE 1.5XLE and its power curve is shown in s cu t i n   rated and cut-out speeds are 3.5 m/s, 14 m/s and 25 m/s respectively  10 minute average wind speeds for four days of summer and winter are plotted from raw data and shown in Fig. 4 From the 10 minute average wind speeds of all locations, it can be found that the wind speeds of the two locations are seldom below the cut-in speed \(about 3.5 m/s to 4 m/s\d above the cut-out speed \(25 m/s\ at the same time. In other words, these locations are able to partly compensate each other’s no wind condition due to geographcal dispersion The percentage of time wind power is unavailable \(wind speed lower than 4 m/s or higher than 25 m/s\ is from 12.64 to 17.59% in summer and from 6.75% to 10.23% in winter for an individual location. Transmission system operators have to increase the reserve requirements to backup the wind power when a new wind farm is connected to the grid. Bigger wind farms need higher reserves. But if multiple wind farms are considered, the wind unavailabl e time decreases dramatically The percentage of wind unavailable time is 3.38% in summer and 1.83% in winter when the two locations are considered together as one big wind farm distributed over a large geographical area Based on its power curve, GE 1.5MW XLE wind turbine can produce 5% of its rated power at 5 m/s, 10% at 6 m/s and 20% at 7 m/s

It indicates the amount of generating capacity that can be counted on to help meet peak electricity demand. It is directly related with system reliability. The capacity credit calculation methods and regional applications are reviewed in [6 m e u t ilitie s a n d  Regional Transmission Operator \(RTO\se stochastic method to calculate the capacity credit.

Their calculations only focus on individual wind farm. The capacity credit varies from 5% to 30% of nominal ratings of wind farms depending on the methodology and the system conditions Z-method in w h ich  h a s be en us ed b y P acif i C o rp, can be used to calculate capacity credits for the two locations and their combination.

So the wind penetration in WY is 11%. The average load in WY is about 2,000 MW, which is not far from the assumption in Table III. The two locations are scaled up to 360 MW \(11% of total generation of RTS simulate Wyoming wind power. 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm in July and August is considered peak demand time in WY. The wind availability \(power produced by wind is greater than 0\ in two locations and their combination is shown in Table IV and V The forced outage rate is the probability of zero output power of wind farms. In other words, the forced outage rate is one minus wind power availability  TABLE  III   M ODEL A SSUMPTIONS  Generation Load  Reserve Mean 3197MW 2850MW 345MW Standard Deviation 231MW 200MW 307MW Z 1.126 Reserve Margin 19  The load carrying capability is calculated for each location with capacity of 360 MW. It is then compared with 180 MW each placed at those two locations with a resulting total of 360 MW, shown in the Tables IV-VI as combination. The load carrying capability, i.e. capacity credit, is shown in Table VI The capacity credit awarded to the combination of the two locations is highest and it is over twice of the lowest location A. Even the capacity credit of the better location B is lower than that of the combination. Both the system operator and wind farm owners can benefit from the combination of the two locations: the system operator can decrease the reserve because combination of multiple wind farms can increase the firm output; the owners of wind farms can share the capacity credit and lower the integration cost, which is proportional to the required reserve The above calculation is based on the wind data measured at locations around 300 km apart. Their correlations become lower when they are distributed farther. If the wind farms in Wyoming and Texas are considered as one big wind power resource, a higher proportion of wind power could be considered a firm resource to produce electricity

Compared with each location, the combination of the two locations can increase the wind availability. The capacity credit is higher when the wind power from the two locations is combined. As the method to cal culate capacity credit used here is also used by electric utilities, the potential for awarding more capacity credit to multiple wind farms is very good VI.

Cost distribution of requirements  6. Adding threat assessment to the prioritization process  AHP provides a good quantitative basis for making a decision about the relative priority of a given set of requirements. However, it does not factor in the additional dimension of risk. In order to do that all risks associated with each requirement have to be identified and assessed for likelihood and impact. As noted before, there are many ways of modeling risk These days, threat modeling is also a popular alternative, which we illustrate in conjunction with AHP prioritization, by subjecting our sample set to a threat modeling exercise.  A sample risk assessment form along these lines can be found at http://www.securedigitalsolutions.com/articles/Gener ic%20Risk%20Assessment%20Form.pdf Each threat associated with each requirement is identified through a threat model. That might produce such hazards as ?subject to cross site scripting attacks?, or ?inadequate access controls?. Each of these threats is then ranked on two factors, likelihood and impact. The ranking is expressed on a seven level Likert scale ranging from highest-to-lowest. The result would produce two outcomes likelihood \(1-7 and impact \(1-7 weight, in order to normalize them these two scores could then be multiplied together in order to obtain a single risk factor score \(\(L I R threat scores are multiplied to obtain a single threat index. The aim is to rank the requirement set by the relative level of threat associated with each requirement. In our example that might produce the ranking shown in Figure 4 These are then ranked as very high risk \(&gt;200 high risk \(&gt;100 gt;50 gt;25 and no risk \(&lt;25 risk requirement. SR-6 and SR-4 are high-risk requirements. SR-1, SR-2, and SR-3 are moderate risk requirements and SR-5, SR-8 and SR-9 represent negligible risks Then referring to the results of the AHP ranking it is possible to think about these requirements in a different way. SR-6, which was identified as a high priority, is also a high risk. Whereas, SR-1, SR-2 and SR-3, which are high priority items, are shown to only represent a moderate risk. Better still SR-5 


only represent a moderate risk. Better still SR-5 which is a high priority requirement, is a low risk And to make a further case against SR-4 and SR-7 which were identified as low priority requirements in the AHP analysis, these two requirements also represent the two greatest risks in the requirements set Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5  Figure 3.

Comparative threat levels per requirement That outcome changes our picture somewhat, in the sense that decision makers might want to revisit or perhaps re-prioritize based on potential risk. This is particularly true in the case of SR-6. It might also suggest that the status of SR-1, which is approaching high-risk status, be revisited. At the same time, it is easy to justify the priority of SR-2, SR-3 and SR-5 based on their relative threat index. Finally, it is also easy to consider dropping SR-4 and SR-7 out of the set if resource constraints arise This modified approach has not yet been applied in our student case studies. One of the challenges we face is that students have an expectation for crisp results. They are not used to the idea that when they are doing research case studies, the results may be unpredictable. In our view, this makes these kinds of case studies more interesting and more challenging for the students, as well as helping our research  7. Conclusions  The aim of this article was to introduce the potential additional value of threat modeling/ risk understanding to the requirements prioritization process. The information that these additional analysis processes provide permits decision makers Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 to undertake the construction process in such a way that the most critical functional and security requirements are always included in the final build Exposing students to these processes can help them understand the sophisticated decisions that must be made in real development settings Moreover, that information can then be used by decision makers to make intelligent decisions about the amount of investment that they wish to make in their software. That will allow them to maximize 


their software. That will allow them to maximize their investment and thereby ensure both their profitability the as well as the overall safety and security of their organization. That will allow every member of the organization to be confident that their software assets provide the greatest value for the investment as well as the greatest security possible From the educational perspective, if we introduce students to sophisticated decision making processes in the real world, they will be better equipped to make such decisions when the time comes  8.

representation Plan schemas for resource-constrained planning and scheduling. The MACRO field agents use plan schemas \(also called template plans or skeletal plans  been used in other situations where complete planning was too time consuming for appropriate responses. MACRO's plan schemas have been enhanced with scheduling information, such as in [28], and generated through partial order planning techniques, like [29]. The combination of MACRO server-based agents using the SA-POP planning/scheduling service with generated schemas used by MACRO field agents provides a uniquely flexible solution for autonomy in sensor webs with a server cluster connected to DRE field systems 6. CONCLUDING REMARKS The SEAMONSTER project exhibits distributed deployment infrastructure challenges common to computationally constrained field environments in adaptive sensor webs, including standardized execution of low-level hardware-dependent actions and on-going data tasks, automated provisioning of agents for heterogeneous field hardware, and minimizing deployment infrastructure overhead in general. This paper presents the results of applying the MACRO platform with extensions designed to address these deployment challenges in SEAMONSTER. In particular, the Action/Effector framework addressed key deployment challenges as follows 9  Separate concerns by creating a unified mechanism for deploying and executing brief, low-level actions  Substantially reduce footprint of individual actions versus implementation as a component  Improve deployment latency by two orders of magnitude over a similar component implementation The remainder of this section summarizes lessons learned from applying MACRO to SEAMONSTER and outlines our future work optimizing MACRO's QoS-enabled component middleware infrastructure Lessons Learned The lessons learned from our extensions to the MACRO distributed deployment infrastructure include  Feasible integration of non-component entities. The Effector/Action framework has demonstrated the feasibility of integrating non-component entities into component assemblies where footprint, latency, or lifetime rules out the use of a full component  Unitary Effector may limit framework flexibility. A unitary Effector \(i. e., one which is incapable of operating in a hierarchical manner with other effectors in dynamic sensor web environments. Extending the Effector interface to support hierarchical and peer behavior with other Effectors deployed to the same node\(s advantages: \(1 lary as nearby nodes and devices power up/down in response to changing power availability and \(2 of"meta-Actions," which are ordered compositions of one or more concrete actions across one or more Effectors  A synchronous Effector interface may cause unacceptable delays. If an Action hangs or takes longer to complete than expected, the present synchronous interface will also cause the agent plan execution code to hang. This behavior is undesirable, however, since it may cause the agent to miss other important deadlines in its current plan of execution. Asynchronous Effector and Action interfaces can alleviate this concern  CIAO footprint is too large for resource constrained systems. The stringent resource constraints \(i.e., 32-64 MB RAM and processors operating at 266 MHz or less MONSTER field hardware were a significant hurdle due to the overhead \(especially memory footprint nents and deployment infrastructure. Previous CIAO developments focused on environments with significantly greater resources, e.g., nlore than a gigabyte of RAM and processors 


resources, e.g., nlore than a gigabyte of RAM and processors faster than two gigahertz. While CIAO is operational on the SEAMONSTER hardware, as indicated in Section 4, further work is needed to make the middleware efficient under tight resource constraints 10  DaNCE footprint and deployment latency is too high for resource constrained systems. As shown in Section 4, the largest consumers ofmemory in the middleware stack are the DAnCE daemons, in particular the ExecutionManager and NodeManager. The footprint of the newer deployment and configuration aspects of the middleware has been largely overlooked until now and needs to be addressed. Perhaps more importantly is the latency experienced during deployment, which has been observed to take as long as several minutes on SEAMONSTER hardware Future Work To further reduce the overhead of CIAO components and the DAnCE deployment infrastructure, we are working on multiple approaches, including context-aware generative techniques to prune unnecessary code/features  Generative component specialization. The CCM specification includes several features and capabilities in the component definition that may not be necessary in all situations such as generic navigation, introspection, and security features, which contribute to footprint bloat. Generative techniques could be used to prune these features on a case-by-case basis  Generative container specialization. The CIAO container is intended to be a generic solution providing a large feature set to satisfy user needs in most situations. As such it contains features and services that may not be necessary in specific deployments, and could be pruned by generating scenario-specific container implementations  Improve separation of concerns in DAnCE. The current DAnCE implementation tangles concerns of deployment and configuration with the run-time elements of the component server in the NodeApplication. This entanglement increases footprint by replicating large swathes of deployment logic in each component server. Careful analysis and refactoring is therefore needed to substantially decrease footprint and deployment latency ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, RACE, and SA-POP are opensource software that can be downloaded from download dre.vanderbilt.edu REFERENCES 1] K.

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models. The following is a summary for the potential benefits of introducing DHF models to reliability and PHM  i 


i models into time and covariate dependent dynamic counterparts  ii models and reliability analysis in a more realistic manner  iii level  whether or not functional components \(loyal generals diagnose correctly and take proper actions such as fault mask of failed components \(traitors asymmetric  iv survivability analysis. Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
