An evaluation of agreement and conflict among computer forensics experts  Gregory H. Carlton California State Polytechnic University College of Business Administration Computer Information Systems Department ghcarlton@csupomona.edu     Reginald Worthley University of Hawaii Shidler College of Business Dept. of Information Technology Management worthley@hawaii.edu   Abstract  The use of computer data as evidence within litigation is growing rapidly. Additionally, courts 
define computer data as a form of scientific evidence The courts recognize that subject matter of scientific evidence is outside the general knowledge of the public, and it is beneficial for someone with special skills in the subject to explain the scientific evidence to the court; therefore, expert witnesses are permitted to enter their opinions into evi dence to explain the data However, a recent study identified widespread conflict among professionals in the field of computer forensics This conflict raises serious questions concerning the data presented as evidence, the conclusions drawn by judges and juries, and the impact of those affected by the outcomes of legal proceedings. This paper 
discusses the findings of an analysis performed on data collected from computer forensics examiners and attorneys with computer forensics experience and provides a call for additional research     1. Introduction  The courts now recognize the significance of examining digital data from computer systems personal data assistants \(PDA\d cellular telephones in virtually all cases. As typewriters have become relics of the past, it is largely accepted that records of individuals correspondence, calculations, and documentation are maintained on computer systems 
This wealth of information is available to be submitted as evidence in legal matters when acquired, analyzed and reported using forensics methodology, and the volume of digital evidence is growing rapidly The usage of computer forensics methodology is required when submitting digital data as evidence, as the courts have ruled that digital data is a form of scientific information ita l data, lik e a l l  scientific information, is considered by the courts to be of a complexity that is beyond the understanding of the general public; therefore, an expert with specialized 
education, experience, and training within this field is needed to explain this complex material to the judge and jury, who represent members of the general public Computer forensics methodology is based on the scientific premise that an established, measurable process is followed that is generally accepted within the fiel In div i du als q u ali f i ed b y th e cou r ts to  provide expert testimony in trials are uniquely permitted to provide their opinions as evidence when their opinions are derived from their analysis of data within their area of expertise [1 T h is u n i q u e abilit y to  enter an individual

empirical study of forensic data acquisition tasks, the dissertation used Grounded Theory to identify and measure a set of 103 tasks performed by forensic computer examiners pertaining to the data acquisition of personal computer workstations o ren s i c  examiners were then asked to identify to what extent they perform each of the 103 tasks. Additionally performance measures for each of the 103 tasks were obtained from two expert review panels, one panel of technical experts and the othe r panel of legal experts Lastly, the performance measures from the forensic examiners and expert review panels were compiled into a task performance gu  Although the study described above fulfilled its objective by establishing an empirical set of forensic data acquisition tasks, it also provided data from which additional questions arose. Additional analysis of this data revealed numerous conflicts among the participants of the study concerning task performance For example, for certain tasks, there appeared to be a high degree of agreement between the responses of forensic computer examiners, the review panel of technical experts and the review panel of legal experts However, for another subset of tasks, the responses of the forensic computer examiners were in conflict with the opinions of the expert review panel members Additionally, there were tasks in which the responses from the panel of technical experts were in conflict with the panel of legal experts, and lastly, tasks were identified where members within either expert review panel had conflicting responses Given the significance of expert testimony in the legal environment pertaining to computer forensics conflicts among experts in this field present a dilemma This dilemma stems from the fact that judges and juries rely on the opinions of experts to explain scientific material that is outside the area of expertise of the general public; however, it appears that frequently within this field, the experts have conflicting opinions This paper discusses the analysis of agreement and conflict among the participants of this study  2. Data collection  The goals of the initial study described above were to identify forensic data acquisition tasks and then measure the extent to which these tasks are performed To achieve these goals, data were collected from forensic computer examiners and attorneys with expertise in computer forensics.  The data collection process consisted of two phases of the initial study whereby the first phase was concerned with identifying the tasks and the second phase was concerned with measuring the tasks indentified during the first phase To identify the forensic data acquisition tasks of personal computer workstations, Grounded Theory was utilized in a series of four surveys, and the questions on these surveys evolved from general, open-ended questions on the first survey to more specific, closedended questions on the fourth survey. A point of theoretical saturation was reached during the fourth survey when 103 forensic data acquisition tasks emerged from the data. A thorough discussion of the survey instruments is presented in Carlton s dissertation e r to Table 1. Data acqu i sition tasks for a complete listing of the task descriptions During the second phase of data collection, a fifth survey was administered that consisted of specific closed-ended questions designed to measure the extent in which forensics examiners perform each task Each of the five questionnaires surveyed members of the High Technology Crime Investigation Association \(HTCIA\nd procedures were established to ensure that no one responded more than once Additionally, the first question on each of the five questionnaires asked whether the respondent performs forensic data acquisitions, and only the records for those that responded positively to the first question on each survey were evaluated Also, during the second phase of the data collection process, two expert review panels, a panel of technical experts and a panel of legal experts, were questioned to measure the importance of the performance of each task  2.1. Examiner task performance  The fifth questionnaire consisted of closed-ended questions that asked HTCIA members to indicate a measure of their task performance by selecting one of four choices that range within a scale from never performing the task to always performing the task for each of the 103 tasks.  Those four choices are: I always perform the task; I typically perform the task, but I may omit it in some cases; I typically omit the task, but I may perform it in some cases; I never perform the task The respondents were also asked to indicate the conditions that would cause them to add or omit each of the 103 tasks from a set of 8 conditions that emerged from the data collected in the previous four surveys Additionally, respondents were asked a series of questions regarding characteristics, such as, their education, experience, training, certifications, type of employment, age, gender, self-ratings, and their opinions concerning qualities that they consider to be good measures of a forensics examiner s qualifications The data concerning task conditions Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


and examiner qualities are addressed in another paper as this paper focuses on expert agreement and conflict  2.2. Expert review panel ratings  Two expert review panels were subsequently surveyed regarding each of 103 tasks identified in section 2.1.  One expert review panel consisted of five HTCIA members recognized for their technical prowess as forensic computer examiners, and the second review panel consisted of five attorneys with extensive experience with cases involving computer forensics h e ex pert rev i e w pa n e l m e m b ers  w e re  asked to consider the performance of each of the 103 tasks solely on the basis of their area of expertise namely technical merit or legal merit, and each expert review panel member was asked to indicate his or her opinion for each of the 103 tasks by selecting from one of five choices that range within a scale from the task being absolutely prohibited to the task being absolutely essential. The five choices are: performance of the task is absolutely prohibited; performance of the task is undesired; performance of the task makes no contribution and causes no harm; performance of the task is desired; performance of the task is absolutely essential The data collected from the survey of expert review panel members resulted in three merit ratings, an overall expert panel merit rating, a technical expert panel merit rating, and a legal expert panel merit rating. The examiner performance measures and the expert panel merit ratings were compiled into a monograph yielding a task performance guide, thus providing a previously unavailable empirical study from which forensic computer examiners and attorneys can refer when preparing for expert testimony to support their decisions to perform or omit specific tasks concerning a given case   3. Analysis and findings  The 5 technical and 5 legal experts rated each of the 103 tasks on a scale ranging from 0 \(i.e, absolutely prohibited\ 4 \(i.e., absolutely essential\here were many tasks where the experts agreed with one another within their panel and also between panels. There were, however, many tasks where the legal experts did not agree with the technical experts, and there were also tasks where there was conflict within the respective panels with respect to rating a task  Table 1.

Tables 1 and 3 reveal much similarity between the ratings of tasks between the two panels, but Table 4 Largest technical and legal conflicts features tasks where the two panels rate the same tasks very differently showing conflict between the two panels Tasks 25, 24, 26, 95 and 89 are all rated much higher on average, by the technical panel members than by the legal panel members, with all showing a mean difference of 1.0 or more. Tasks 32, 69, 61, 47 and 68 all are rated much higher, on average, by the legal panel members than by the technical panel members also with all showing a mean difference of 1.0 or more. Table 4. Largest technical and legal conflicts also reports the p-value from a t-test for differences in means. Most of the p-values do not show a significant difference at a usual significance level of 05 because the sample sizes of 5 are very small and also because of conflict within each panel that results in large standard deviations  Table 4.

It is ordered by the magnitude of standard deviation, and it shows the actual ratings from each expert as well There is an extremely large variety of ratings for these tasks. For example, task 28 shows one expert giving a rating of 0 \(i.e., absolutely prohibited\d another giving a rating of 4 \(i.e., absolutely essential\asks 64 and 79 are similar in that they exhibit the same range of responses.  The remaining tasks also show a wide range of ratings among the panel members, varying from either 1 to 4 or from 0 to 3, except for task 13. Task 13 shows three members of the panel with a rating of 2 and the remaining two members agreeing with a rating of 4  Table 5.

It is interesting to note that the two tables overlap with only three tasks, 22, 56 and 64.  The largest range occurred in tasks 82 and 101 where the experts ratings vary from 0 to 4, the largest possible discrepancy. Most of the rest of the tasks show variability in ratings from either 1 to 4 or from 0 to 3.  The only exceptions are tasks 22, 65 and 66  Table 6.

Topics of agreement or conflict  A closer inspection of the task descriptions where the experts largely were in agreement or conflict helps to identify topics where additional clarification is beneficial. Although not problematic, the tasks identified as those with high agreement scores represent tasks where the technical and legal aspects of those tasks are likely to be better understood by the experts. The areas of concern focus on those tasks where conflict scores were highest Two topics are observed as being particularly problematic regarding tasks with high levels of conflict. The first area represents those tasks pertaining to a suspect computer workstation that is running at the time the forensic examiner encounters it. The second area represents those tasks pertaining to disconnecting or removing secondary storage devices other than hard disks. Both of these areas are discussed below Overall, fifteen of the 103 tasks represent conditions dependent upon the computer workstation being either on or off. Tasks 21 through 33 begin with the condition If the computer workstation is powered on and tasks 34 and 35 being with the condition if the computer workstation is powered off First, it is interesting to note that none of these tasks are listed in Table 3. Top rated tasks, as the experts did not reach high levels of agreement on any of these fifteen tasks. More problematic is the high level of conflict that occurred among the tasks within this topic. Six of these tasks had the highest levels of conflict within the panel of technical experts, two tasks had the highest level of conflict within the panel of legal experts, and four of the tasks had the highest level of conflict between the two panels of experts For example, task 22, which states if the computer workstation is powered on and the workstation s monitor is powered on and blank move the mouse to terminate the screen saver  obtained high levels of conflict within both panels of experts. One member of the panel of technical experts and two members of the panel of legal experts indicated that this task was desired, two members of the panel of technical experts and three members of the panel of legal experts indicated that this task was undesired, and two members of the panel of technical experts indicated that this task is absolutely prohibited Additionally, although tasks 24 through 26 concern similar concepts pertaining to gathering information from a computer workstation prior to powering it off, each these three tasks achieved high levels of conflict between the two expert panels while task 24 obtained a high level of conflict within the panel of technical experts and task 26 obtained a high level of conflict within the panel of legal experts Clearly, the experts were not in agreement concerning the performance of tasks when confronting a computer workstation that is powered on. This represents an area where additional information would be helpful to provide a better understanding of best practices among computer forensics practitioners High conflict scores were also observed in the four tasks concerning the topic of disconnecting or removing secondary storage devices other than hard disks; however, it is particularly confounding that three of these tasks are also among those tasks with the highest levels of agreement. Tasks 53, 54, and 55 are listed in Table 3. Top rated tasks, as their mean scores are all 3.5. Also notice that each of these tasks earned consistent scores from the individual experts In other words, although there were differences among the scores assigned by the panel members for each of these tasks, each expert was individually consistent by assigning the same score for all three tasks. For each of these three tasks, technical panel member numbers 1, 2, and 5 assigned a score of absolutely essential to the task, technical panel member number 3 assigned a score of desired, and technical panel member number 4 assigned a score of undesired.  These scores resulted in a high level of conflict within the panel of technical experts However, when considering the overall scores of the panel of technical experts with the panel of legal experts, with four members indicating that the tasks were absolutely essential and one member indicating that the tasks were desired, the two panels were largely in agreement While the conditions found in tasks 53, 54, and 55 might indicate an outlier with technical panel member number 4, this view looses some merit when these three tasks are considered along with the scores of similar task 56. Task 56, disconnect all USB devices from the system unit, does not achieve a high level of agreement between the expert panels, and there is a high level of conflict within each panel Interestingly, both panels had the same number of members issuing the same scores for task 56.  Both panels had three members issue a score of absolutely essential, one member indicated desired, and one member assigned the score of undesired to the task Again, there appears to be disagreement among the experts concerning the treatment of secondary storage devices other than hard disks.

clarification concerning the best practices within this topic seems necessary, as mishandling of secondary storage media is likely to result in lost or inadmissible data In addition to the two topics discussed above, it is also interesting to note that of the ten tasks identified as having the highest level of conflict between the panels, scores indicating high conflict within one panel occurred in six of them. Additionally, three tasks were identified as having high conflict within the panel of technical experts and within the panel of legal experts. Of those three tasks, tasks 22 and 56 were discussed above; however, task 64, regarding filtering data based on attorney-client privilege prior to imaging, does not fit into the two topics discussed above. For task 64, one member of the technical panel indicated that it is absolutely essential, one member of the legal panel indicated that the task is desired, three members of the technical panel and two members of the legal panel indicated that it is undesired, and one member of the technical panel and two members of the legal panel indicated that is absolutely prohibited. This high value of conflict within both panels illustrates confusion in an area concerning e-discovery matters, and this is an area that is thought will experience high growth rates within the next several years. Computer forensics examiners will be well-served by additional clarification concerning best practices in e-discovery matters too  4. Conclusions  Our analysis of the data resulted in several interesting findings involving agreement and conflict among experts of computer forensics. Although the observations are interesting, our findings are bound by several limitations, and we see the need for more work to be done on this topic. We will summarize our observations, discuss limitations of our study, and present a call for additional research below  4.1. Summary of observations  It is interesting to note the differences in the levels of agreement observed from the various experts that participated in this study. While it is relatively easy to understand that some of the differences are due to the different perspectives from which the legal experts and the technical experts were asked to evaluate the tasks, there were many differences among each group, as well as differences between the groups. Also, from the complete set of 103 tasks evaluated, only 26 tasks achieved a level of high agreement among all of the experts, representing only 25% of the tasks Tasks where general agreement occurred within each group of experts, yet conflicting ratings occurred between the groups were observed however, this condition accounted for just under 10 of the total tasks evaluated. For example, only 10 tasks from the set of 103 tasks represent conditions where agreement occurred among the members of each panel, and the two panels reached conflicting results.  Although the differences in ratings between panels can be explained through the specific conditions from which each panel evaluates tasks differences between members within a panel of experts is more difficult to rationalize, and it occurred more frequently than did the instances where agreement occurred within panels yet conflict occurred between panels. In 16.5% of the tasks evaluated, members of the panel of legal experts reached conflicting ratings whereby at least one member felt very strongly that the task should be performed while at least one other member of the panel strongly felt that the task should not be performed. Even more conflicting was the level of disagreement among the members of the panel of technical experts, as they reached conflicting ratings in 17.5% of the tasks The level of conflict identified in this study cannot be attributed to one panel member providing outlying responses, as only one task among the subset of tasks that highly aligned \(i.e., those shown in Table 3. Top rated tasks\ was included in the subset of tasks with largest conflicts \(i.e., Table 4. Largest technical and legal conflicts\This task, task 10 concerned testing forensic software tools Overall, the large extent of conflict among forensic computer experts raises concern regarding reaching predictable outcomes when used in legal matters.  Forensic science is based upon using a measureable, scientific process to reach an unbiased conclusion, yet as this study illustrates, different forensic computer experts frequently do not reach the same conclusion concerning the importance to forensic task performance  4.2. Limitations  Although we attempted to be thorough in our analysis, it is important to note that numerous limitations exist, especially concerning the data collected. This study limited its survey population to the HTCIA; therefore, bias from the study population may impact th  How e v e r, it is  thought that opinions of experts within an organization, such as the HTCIA, are more likely to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


align than would opinions from a more diverse group of experts, thus measures of conflict are thought to be conservative in this report Also, concerning respondent bias, this study generated its output from a limited number of responses.  Non-respondents expressed reasons for not participating that included distrust, being too busy, vacation, and difficulty authenticating themselves on the survey s Website.  Invalid e-mail addresses and spam blocking filters also contributed to the reduction of responses [8  The set of 103 tasks presented within this report are not implied to represent a comprehensive set of tasks forensic examiners perform pertaining to the forensic data acquisition of personal computer workstations.  This set of tasks is limited to those that were identified by respondents of this study.  No conditional logic regarding the performance of tasks is suggested nor is the sequence of the performance of tasks  4.3. Call for additional research  Given the importance of expert testimony in legal proceedings and the level of conflict among forensic computer experts revealed within this study, more study is needed to develop a better understanding of the causes of conflict and solutions to reduce conflict For example, future studies may identify beneficial solutions from licensing organizations, industry standards, mandatory training, or legislation regarding the credentials of forensic computer examiners. Clearly, the inconsistency among forensic computer examiners opinions identified within this study illustrates a weakness within our legal system that has the potential to alter trail outcomes, thus allowing the guilty to be acquitted and the not-guilty to be wrongly convicted  5.

Figure 5 Statistically multiplexed traffic We note that in this case we would be able to utilize some of the free channel space for other types of transmissions which may be more delay tolerant see Figure 6 For example in this figure the bottom blue transmission can be thought to be a file which is packetized and needs to be transmitted down from the spacecraft We consider this file to be delay tolerant i.e the data is not needed right away down on the ground and it has a lower priority then the other traffics needed to be transmitted The delay tolerant packets will be transmitted only when the channel is not being fully utilized as to fill in the gaps available in the channel bandwidth This technique will delay the arrival of the delay tolerant traffic but will enable us to more fully utilize our channel bandwidth m T]T m Figure 6 Telemetry traffic along with delay tolerant traffic being sent via a channel We note in above scenario that although the delay tolerant traffic was transmitted at time 0 none of it was able to be transmitted until time 1 Also we note that the final delay tolerant traffic packet was transmitted 9 time instances later then it was received For this reason a buffering scheme must be devised such that all the delay tolerant traffic may be buffered until enough bandwidth for transmission exists Since no specific data was available on the dynamics of the various telemetry type traffics we developed a generic telemetry model which is formed by two types of traffic one constant bit rate which represents the sensory information which is constantly being transmitted down to the ground and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents file download and periodic data updates We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to telemetry constant bit rate  peak of intermittent transmission We will also assume that the intermittent transmission file transfer will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new files are ready to be transferred Using the above model we created a Matlab based tool for synthesizing traffic for simulation purposes The traffic generated by this tool is output to a file in a format which can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 5 COMMAND TRAFFIC MODEL The model for the command will be similar in spirit to the model which we have proposed for telemetry We see the data transmitted for command to be formed by two different types of transmission One constant bit rate which represents calls to various preloaded spacecraft subroutines and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents subroutine uploads to the spacecraft We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to command and we also assume that the intermittent transmission subroutine upload will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new subroutines are ready to be transferred Using this model we have developed a Matlab based traffic synthesizing tool The traffic provided by this tool can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 6 CONCLUSIONS This work has resulted in the development of a suite of traffic models that captures the fundamental types that will be in the space communications environment and in particular These models provide the capability to investigate the new IP-based communications functions and resulting performance that are required by the human exploration missions of NASA's Constellation Program and the Space Communications and Navigation SCaN network's ability to support them Four prototypical traffic models have been developed from which any number of streams may be generated 1 audio/voice 2 real-time motion imager live video 3 telemetry including both regular periodic data as well as intermittent file downloads and 4 command including periodic data as well as intermittent subroutine uploads The voice traffic model stochastically parameterizes calls talk times and talk spurts Multiple audio analysis tools were developed to assist in the derivation of parameters from data samples taken from relevant space missions Using these tools parameters of probability distributions were fit to data taken from Shuttle/ISS archives 12     n 


The characterization of motion imagery video traffic involved the stochastic characterization of I P B-frames of MPEG-4 sequences Several Matlab tools were developed to support video analyses wherein ISS and Shuttle specific mission video sequences were used to derive parameters for the associated model A general stochastic model was derived for data telemetry enabling broad parametric applicability ranging among constant bit stream periodic or bursty patterns This same general model through proper selection of parameters may also be used to model command data flow traffic Matlab programs were developed to enable each of the traffic types above to be synthesized and saved into a file for use by SCaN simulation for performance analyses Example flows were generated for a LEO case and an Ascent case and results illustrated using the SCaN Simulator These analyses show the need for such traffic models to determine packet loss including speech intelligibility and latency arising from both statistical multiplexing and potential use of DiffServ prioritization techniques when peak offered loads may undergo transient overload conditions 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration REFERENCES 1 Esther Jennings and David Heckman Architecture Modeling and Performance Characterization of Space Communications and Navigation SCaN Network using MACHETE submitted to 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 1-8 2008 2 Michael Hammer and James Champy Reengineering the Corporation New York Harper Business 1993 3 G Edward Bryan Not All Programmers Are Created Equal 1994 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings February 5-12 1994 4 Voice Activity Detection Using Generalized Gamma Distribution in Advances in Artificial Intelligence part of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3955 2006 5 Athina Markopoulou Fouad Tobagi and Mansour Karam Assessment of VoIP quality over Internet backbones In Proceedings of INFOCOM 2002 6 John Daigle and Joseph Langford Models for Analysis of Packet Voice Communications Systems IEEE JSAC SAC-4 6 1986 7 Harold Stem and Kim-Kwok Wong Modeling the on-off patterns in conversational speech including short silence gaps and the effects of interaction between speaking parties Vehicular Technology Conference 1994 8 0 Rose Statistical Properties of MPEG video traffic and their impact on traffic modeling in ATM systems Institute of Computer Science Report 101 University of Wurzburg 1995 BIOGRAPHY Tudor Stoenescu received a BS in Electrical Engineering  and an MS in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 1999 and a MSE and PhD in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2001 and 2004 respectively After receiving his PhD Dr Stoenescu accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position in Information Science and Technology at California Institute of Technology In 2006 Dr Stoenescu joined the Telecommunications Architecture Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dr Stoenescu's current research interests lie 13
