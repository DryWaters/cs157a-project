On The Economic Role of RIS/PACS in Healthcare: An Empirical Study  Moshe Ayal University of Rochester, NY moshe.ayal@simon.rochester.edu     Abraham Seidmann University of Rochester, NY avi.seidmann@simon.rochester.edu   Abstract  The integration of electr onic patient data records with digital images in PACS is the only way today to provide high-quality clinical services. Such integration enables clinicians to access both systemsê data reliably and consistently, as part of their regular working 
environment. This work extends the literature on RIS/PACS systems by focusing on changes in process dynamics as a source for ongoing firm-level performance improvements. A case discussion of viaHealth/Rochester General Hospital \(RGH medical center that implemented RIS/PACS and subsequently experienced benefits through gains to its continuous improvement efforts, is examined in light of theorized impacts of such implementations on process dynamics. Analyses of longitudinal data suggest that performance along a key metric motivating the RIS/PACS initiative \(i.e., clinical process lead-time showed a significant improvement immediately after system deployment. The data further suggest that the 
system implementation gave rise to ongoing trend of performance improvement, in contrast to a stable performance trend prior to go-live. Finally, we present a general framework for capturing the actual tangible and intangible benefits of RIS/PACS implementation at a major hospital   1. Introduction  Enterprise systems are one of the most important information technology \(IT\categories to emerge in the las Ev en in s t able in dus tries s u ch a s  banking and insurance, organizations must continuously invest in new IT infrastructure to keep up with growing demand and competition [2  I n t h e  
healthcare service, especially in hospitals, medical images are currently created digitally and stored in the radiology department s Picture Archiving and Communication System \(PACS\. Reports are usually stored in the Electronic Patient/Medical Record \(EPR or EMR\ of the Hospital Information System \(HIS and particularly in the Radiology Information System RIS\which is designed to store, manipulate, and retrieve information for planning, organizing directing, and controlling administrative activities associated with the provision and utilization of 
radiology services and facilities. High quality services can only be provided, however, if EPR data is integrated with the digital images in PACS. Clinicians should be able to access both systems' data as part of their regular working environment, whether HIS or RIS. A combined RIS/PACS should allow for teleconferencing with other users, e.g., for consultation with a specialist or technologist in the radiology department PACS consists of image acquisition devices storage archiving units, display workstations, computer processors, and databases. These components are integrated by a communications network and data 
management system. Combining RIS with PACS produces an integrated desktop to enhance diagnostic efficiency and productivity, and streamlining patient information and access a diolog is t s ca n q u ic k l y  view a patient's complete clinical position for fast accurate exam interpretations. Images can be automatically displayed on the workstation's diagnostic monitors, complemented by an RIS side monitor for viewing patient text information. Simple mouse clicks access a comprehensive tool set, exam data, clinical data \(such as laboratory reports\t histories, and 
voice dictation. Activating embedded native tool sets such as 3-D, MPR, MIP, and vessel analysis combined with automated prior image selection is just as quick and easy. Ordering exams is fast, flexible, and accurate with RIS. Requesting physicians can enter orders directly into the RIS through an HL-7 HIS via secure Web communications reducing entry tasks and possibilities for error. Orders can also be entered manually, or scanned in from paper documents, at the radiology reception desk. It all adds up to a more efficient workflow for the radiology unit and better 
service to referring physicians, as well as expanded marketing options In this paper, we provide grounds for supporting or rejecting, some of the claims being raised in relevant professional literature regarding the benefits of implementing a RIS/PACS system, based on realworld data acquired through a field study. The benefits as well as costs of such system implementation have Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 
 


both tangible and intangible characteristics, and our study of these provides a methodology for examining the value of implementation in any healthcare provider that considers going digital. Prior to the implementation, we looked at 150,000 studies radiology procedures\ terms of charges and revenues collected, and for a sample we identified report turn-around times \(TAT\d process bottlenecks. We repeated these inquiries after the RIS/PACS implementation. In addition, we used a survey instrument to measure the changes in the satisfaction levels of radiologists, technology staff, and referring physicians  2. Related Research  Film and film-related savings that are associated with PACS implementation come from the elimination of \(a\he film library, \(b\ilm processors, \(c darkroom and film library personnel, and \(d\ilm costs for specialties \(number of procedures, sheets, etc Investments in new digital modalities continue, even in small enterprises e w a y  to in creas e rev e n u e i s to  increase the volume of healthy covered individuals capitation contracts\mpete for large contracts carve-out'' services and tertiary care. Another way is to expand the hospitals geographic competitive reach Recent studies have shown that a softcopy department will be somewhat more expensive to operate than a conventional one, and that radiologists initially will be slightly less productive when using the new technology. In the long run, however, reports have shown that PACS can be cost effective by allowing for a significant increase in workload and volume of examinations without a corresponding increase in the number of radiologists and technologists  2.1. Tangible Benefits and Costs of RIS/PACS  In general, tangible benefits and costs are commonly known and easy to recognize. Tangible benefits are usually measurable in terms of cost reduction, which is associated with improving business efficiency, and generation of additional sales, which creates additional revenue. Tangible costs put users in control of their expenses, as they are easy to quantify First obvious benefit is savings on purchase and handling of film. PACS implementations achieve an average 80% reduction in film usage within the first y In addition  th ere are repo rts of redu ced costs for film handling, storage, and couriers. The interim steps of prepping jackets, completing paperwork, and locating prior images are eliminated with digital image management. In RGH s Dept of Diagnostic Medical Imaging, films were in use until 15 months after implementation of RIS/PACS. This situation changed only after the head of the department realized that his radiologists hardly used them. According to the department s radiologists, PACS could replace films in every modality except mammography, where radiologists preferred to use films Another benefit is increased productivity Interestingly, academic radiology departments across the United States do not employ a standardized set of productivity and financial indicators to measure their performance, although the radiology literature states that an integrated RIS/PACS help increasing patient throughput and workflow productivity Examination volume is used most frequently to measure productivity, but eight other productivity indicators are also common: examination volume examination volume per modality, technical relative value units \(RVUs\, professional RVUs, technical RVUs per FTE employee, professional RVUs per FTE employee, gross charges by modality, collections by FTE employee, and examination volume by resource or device. General expenses are commonly used as indicators of financial stat m ong a l l  indicators, productivity indicators are the most frequently used [7   T hus  w e c h o s e t o  m e a s ur e  productivity by testing the hypothesis that the RIS/PACS improves the billing system and increases the operational revenues of a diagnostic imaging service provider. Specifically, we examine following hypothesis H1  Implementing RIS/PACS results in a rise in the ratio of charges per procedure, due to a rise in \(a process efficiency, \(b\ a more accurate coding, and \(c faster and more reliable billing  Another benefit is the reduced turnaround time that for radiology practices, is a priority for any radiology service seeking to boost profitability and increase referrals i m porta n t meas u r e m en t of e f f i cien c y in radiology service is the promptness in producing a fina o m e practices docum e n t t i m e s  approaching 30 hours or more for the entire workflow process. One study, conducted in April 2001, found that a RIS measurably and significantly decreases report turnaround and transcription time, resulting in faster bill processing and enabling an increase in the number of procedures performed per month \(RIS Logic in www.merge-efilm.com\. The study was based on a random telephone survey of 150 radiologists and business administrators from diagnostic imaging centers and hospital radiology departments \(among hospitals with 200 and fewer beds\s a result, we specifically outline our second hypotheses as follows H2  RIS/PACS will improve the flow time of the diagnostic imaging service provider by reducing both Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 
 


a\ the diagnostic examination time and \(b\ the total service time. This reduction is a result of both \(a shorter lead times in phases and \(b\ exploiting the traditional process bottlenecks Apart from the system itself, a major cost is that of network and DICOM connectivity. The focal points of the preliminary groundwork are the hospital s IT infrastructure, its Virtual Local Area Network VLAN\d modality readiness for delivering DICOM images. In fact, software integration is becoming a critical component, as hardware accounts for less than 30% of the cost of PACS bs or a shared network environment, add another layer to the installation. A shared network environment cannot support the core PACS architecture. Rather, the facility needs to utilize the slower network for Web distribution. This approach entails creating a VLAN for the dedicated PACS network. A VLAN adds to the cost of the project, based on its size, the number of switches, and the geographic area that must be covered. Other factors that come into play include cabling and the network backbone infrastructure [10    2.2. Intangible Benefits and Costs of RIS/PACS  The intangible, or qualitative, benefits and costs of RIS/PACS are described in this section. In general intangible benefits and costs are hard to recognize and identify, and they are also hard to measure in terms of cost reduction. First intangible benefit is an increased satisfaction from service. Indeed, technology is a tool that comes in many forms and usually helps improve efficiency and effectiveness and, as a direct result satisfaction from medical service. For example: Rhode Island Hospital has seen patient satisfaction increase from 30% to 90% since its ER redesign and PACS implementa w e v e r, tech n o lo gy alon e does not improve the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care. Any successful implementation of technology requires a complete understanding of the technology s capabilities and limitations as well as the processes it replaces and connects ons equ e n t l y   w e  w e re  also curious to examine whether referring physicians that are familiar with new technology will be more satisfied by the ex-post radiology service. We specifically outline two hypotheses on customer satisfaction as H3  RIS/PACS improves total customer \(referring physician\ satisfaction with regard to the following: \(a service duration; \(b\ availability of studies; \(c\ service workflow H4  Customer satisfaction is higher among customers who actively use the new RIS/PACS  technology to communicate with the department compared with those who do not  Examinations are associated with the appropriate referring MDs based on information received from the RIS. By interfacing the PACS with RIS/HIS, data entry time is reduced, errors are eliminated, and a single source for access to patient and examination data is provided. One study investigated such an interface in a Department of Defense hospital and found that data mapping during installation saves significant amounts of time, improves productivity, and increases user acceptance during PACS implementation. In addition the PACS and RIS/HIS interface reduce the amount of manual data entry into multiple automated systems Improved interaction among departments is also a benefit, as PACS can bring substantial benefits to many departments of the health-care facility \(e.g., ED ICU, Operations, etc.\proving clinical care and turnaround times. Improved cooperation and interaction between departments, however, are not necessarily a given. Hospitals that pay close attention to the needs of the various departments before, during and after PACS implementation are most likely to realize better results Finally, costs of cooperation between departments have to be taken into account. On the other hand increased cooperation usually entails the costs of collaborative effort as well, and it requires an analysis of the department s workflows and image-viewing needs to devise an optimal solution. Components to consider include the types of workstations and monitors, viewing locations and conditions, training and tools to facilitate communication between radiologists and clinicians  2.3. IT Productivity and Benefits  A significant body of literature examines the strategic aspects of Electronic Data Interchange \(EDI   d [1 5]. How e v e r  th ere h a v e bee n on l y a  few systematic empirical assessments of the strategic benefits of this technology. Prior work has primarily considered the impact of EDI, e.g., one study found that EDI leads to a range of benefits for an industrial supplier, depending on how technology choices are made by its trading partners. Among others, they found that advanced EDI significantly reduces the probability of rework and delay e veral w o rks tr y to m easu r e  the benefits of information technology using empirical techniques. However, most of the articles carry out empirical investigation at the industry or the economy level. One study explored the effect of computerization on productivity and output growth, and found that computerization makes a contribution to measured productivity and output growth in the short term that is consistent with normal returns to computer investments. Moreover, the productivity and output Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 
 


contributions associated with computerization are up to 5 times greater over several years e v e r, th e  observed contribution of computerization is accompanied by relatively large and time-consuming investments in complementary inputs, such as organizational capital, that may be omitted in conventional calculations of productivity Recent empirical research has already suggested that implementing firms realize productivity and market capitalization benefits d s t u d ies of operational performance suggest that ERP positively influences performance over time ad dition  a case of a firm that implemented ERP and subsequently experienced benefits through gains to its continuous improvement efforts. The case [15 a s ex a m in ed i n  light of theorized impacts of such implementations on process dynamics. Analyses of longitudinal data suggest that performance along a key metric motivating the ERP initiative \(i.e., order fulfillment lead-time\owed a significant improvement immediately after system deployment. The data further suggest that the system implementation gave rise to an ongoing trend of performance improvement, in contrast to a stable performance trend prior to go-live. In addition, evidence on gains for Just-in-Time systems can be substantially increased by modern information technology support  Compared with conventional film-screen operation filmless operation using computed radiography was associated with a significant decrease in technologist examination times in the performance of general radiographic examinations. They inferred that the decrease in technologist examination times in a filmless environment offers the potential for increased productivity with resulting personnel savings and improved operational efficiency e v e r, th e y  put primary focus of productivity enhancements on technologists, without considering the effects on radiologists, which might be found unjustified, as our study suggests. Overall, there is very little empirical research at the firm level, and literature lacks a quantification of the impact of the implementation of a large healthcare IT system, like RIS/PACS, on the operations of the healthcare provider The combination of image-centric PACS and information-centric RIS enables hospitals and imaging centers to simultaneously manage and archive medical images. Relevant prior examinations are prefetched from the archive for comparison immediately. A worklist-enabled modality allows the technologist to select the scheduled examination from an existing list avoiding the redundant entry of information. This automation eliminates costly typing errors that may cause examinations to be filed with the wrong identification. Moreover, referring physicians can log in and view studies, including all images and completed reports  3.  Context Specification and Data  To validate our hypotheses, we measured process times and revenues and conducted satisfaction surveys of the staff and customers of the viaHealth/Rochester General Hospital \(RGH\ a medical center in Rochester, NY, during the years 2004-2006. We emphasize that no major incidents happened during the period of study, other than the implementation of RIS/PACS - even the number of clinicians staid the same and only few administrative employees were fired    Figure 1. The Clinical Process in the Department Before it Goes Filmless  Figure 1 depicts the clinical process in the department before it goes filmless. Delays occurred mostly in those cases in which a study was not successful. Upon such occasions in the film-based process, the technologists had to spent time at least a couple minutes replacing films and reloading the machines, whereas with PACS both deleting and reloading is done in seconds. However, this is just Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 
 


aspect of shortening the process lead-time. A careful examination of the flow revealed a substantial bottleneck shift in the process. With specific reference to Figure 1, this process effect describes a sequence of activities targeted at temporary bottleneck alleviation at the transcription, i.e subordination to bottlenecks   lti m a tel y  g i v i n g ri se to a tran s f or m a tio n a l eff ect  on the fulfillment process, i.e swifter fulfillment    3.1. Billing Turnaround  Figure 2 displays the billing process in the Diagnostic Imaging Department before and after RIS/PACS implementation. Phases that have been eliminated from the After process are shadowed. The two shadowed phases represent the frequent need of the department s billing unit to go looking for about 10% of the studies again, based on the clinical report they got after the Sign-2 phase. Often, this would bring the operation to the edge of failure, as the department just barely complied with the hospital s rule requiring billing of inpatient services within three days after the exam and of outpatient services within eight days. The head of radiology operations estimated that this had also contributed to the level of studies not billed by the department    Figure 2. The Billing Process in the Diagnostic Imaging Department   Figure 3. Revenue per Procedure per Modality Before and After RIS/PACS Implementation  Diag. Imaging Dept, RGH: \(a\; \(b\Total  We hypothesized that integrated RIS/PACS improves the billing system of a service provider and thus results in faster billing. We first examined whether the department s total revenues increased after implementation. Figure 3 shows the results per modality. This figure and Table 1 provide patterns for one of the main five modalities of the department CT as well as totals for the whole department \(5 modalities: \(1\ostic \(Regular X-ray, CR, DR 2\T; \(3\vasive; \(4\e; and \(5 Ultrasound\r results clearly show that an increase in the revenue per procedure followed the RIS/PACS implementation for all procedures, with the exception of the CT modality. Moreover, the growth rate of revenue per procedure in the department has more than doubled, from less than $2 per procedure per month to 4   Table 1: Revenue Per Procedure Per Modality Before and After RIS/PACS Implementation    Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 
 


3.2. Turnaround Times  Since process-changes tend to extend the implementation time-frame, the opportunity exists for additional information gains to yield ongoing process change and performance improvement e of those dimensions of process improvement is turn around time. Thus, we measured the time required for the generic process conducted in the radiology department of viaHealth/RGH. Our benchmark was similar data collected in June 2004, before the RIS/PACS implementation at RGH, by a team of researchers from Kodak. Their data consisted of 400 representatives TAT measurements. After RIS/PACS was implemented, in August 2004, we retrieved data on each procedure directly from the RIS. We tracked the time performance during the period August 2004  October 2006. We collected data on the duration of the four main phases of a generic service: \(a\xam done b\; \(c\ranscription; and \(d\ign-1 residents\ and/or Sign-2 \(attending physicians\ for final approval. Figure 4 describes the results of the average duration per phase across all modalities for the Diagnostic Imaging Department    Figure 4. The Diagnostic Imaging Dept, RGH a\rocedures per Month; \(b\TAT Learning Curve   The results confirm our hypotheses regarding significant reductions in diagnostic examination times Within a year, the time required for approval of a transcribed report went down from about 50 hours to less than 20. Moreover, improvement was detected in all phases of the process. The most impressive improvement was achieved in the transcription phase where cycle time was reduced from about 60 hours prior to RIS/PACS implementation to about 4 hours immediately after implementation, and further to less than an hour within a year Improvement was not always immediate, however Our results suggest that the time required for dictation increased from 8 hours to 25 immediately after implementation. Eventually, as radiologists gained experience with the system, this figure decreased to below the original value, down to 4 hours. In fact although significant cycle-time improvements were achieved for all phases, only transcription experienced shorter durations immediately. A learning period of a couple months was required before the department could achieve broader improvements Figure 4\(b\ovides the aggregate learning curve of the department. Using the classical logarithmic model \(e.g n k 1  n^b w h ere k 1 is t h e T A T  at month 1, we find that b = -0.665. This implies that the learning rate is r = 10^ \(b* log 2\ = 63% during the first year after implementation. The aggregate 80 total TAT reduction, down from about 100 hours upon implementation to around 20 hours after 10 months, is indeed phenomenal. However, as the national benchmark for the service duration is 12 hours, the department must still effect additional improvements in cycle time, using the wealth of information now provided by the RIS/PACS system    Figure 5. TAT at the Diagnostic Imaging Dept RGH: Pareto Chart \(a\fore and \(b\After RIS/PACS Implementation    The Pareto charts in Figure 5 suggest that the exam phase made a negligible contribution to the total TAT both before and after RIS/PACS implementation Transcription, which used to make up half the total TAT, has been dramatically reduced to a very small part \(5%\. Sign-1 and Sign-2 went up from a 40 share to more than 70%, so these offer the greatest potential for operational improvement  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 
 


3.2. Customer Satisfaction  To validate our two hypotheses on the effect on customer satisfaction, we conducted a survey. Once again, the pre-implementation data were collected at viaHealth/RGH in June 2004 by a research team from Kodak. They used a satisfaction questionnaire distributed among staff and customers. With a response rate of approximately 40%, the survey yielded data from 150 referring physicians \(see Appendix A In August 2004, the RIS/PACS system was implemented in the department. We waited for implementation to be completed at the referring physicians sites to conduct a second survey. We anticipated that we would witness a dramatic change in their satisfaction with the diagnostic imaging service We likewise expected notable improvements in staff satisfaction within the radiology department. This ex post survey was conducted in October 2006, with over 70 responses from referring physicians \(Appendix B The customer - referring physicians - survey focused on four dimensions of the process: time, workflow quality, and interaction with the radiology staff. The results are summarized in Table 2  Table 2: Satisfaction with the Department Among Customers Before RIS/PACS Implementation   The table presents the number of responses received for each question, and the median, lower and upper quartile values. In order to identify patterns in the data and highlight their similarities and differences we use the Principal Components Analysis \(PCA methodology. The table presents the results of the PCA analysis, specifying the main eigenvectors of the normalized covariance matrix of the data and their percentage explaining the responses variance The results show that referring physicians were satisfied with their level of interaction with the department personnel mainly with the radiologists median = 6\d somewhat less with the technologists and administrative staff \(median = 5\he customers were indifferent \(median = 4\arding the workflow and the quality of the service, but they were not satisfied with the time it took to produce a radiology report. Indeed, the time required to receive a final report led many respondents to act according to the preliminary report without waiting. We anticipated that implementing the RIS/PACS system would improve customers level of satisfaction from the diagnostic imaging service. Indeed, the after results were significantly higher. Figure 6 shows the median, lower and upper quartile values for each question    Figure 6. Referring Physicians Satisfaction Level After RIS/PACS Implementation  We computed one-way ANOVA to test whether data from compared questions have a common mean Our results clearly show that they do not. Table 3 quantifies the differences in referring physicians  satisfaction levels before and after RIS/PACS implementation  Table 3: Multiple Comparison: Before and After RIS/PACS Implementation   To validate our hypothesis that referring clinicians who use the new technology are more satisfied with the service than those who do not, we establish a predictor Usage of technology We add to the model another predictor Time to receive a signed final report  which the literature suggests is associated with overall Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 
 


satisfaction. We construct a model of total satisfaction  TOT hich takes the following form TOT = b0 b1 * FNR + b2 * TCU + err Results are summarized in Table 4. We see that satisfaction is even higher among those referring physicians who actively use the technology fully with PACS at their own or the hospital s site. The results are statistically significant at p < 1  Table 4: Model of Total Satisfaction: After RIS/PACS Implementation   4. Discussion  Some works documented in detail new information technology \(IT\plementation in a single manufacturing organization o ppos ed to m o re  general studies that analyze data from many organizations. However, this work is amongst the first to study a service organization, particularly in healthcare, with IT impact. Therefore, here intangibles like satisfaction, are as important as tangibles, such as turn around time \(TAT\e financial impacts on the service provider - and those were documented in detail As we observed, the rapid improvement, that does not coincide with the common productivity paradox  is a direct result of the fact that the bottleneck in our case was the most prone to technology usage, and happily adopted his part in the system implementation Having such an outstanding improvement on the spot fueled the improvement process of the whole organization, and enabled significant gains in productivity From a managerial perspective, case examination at the end of the study period showed that the bottom-line impact of the lead-time improvements was significant for viaHealth/Rochester General Hospital \(RGH\e observed a phenomenal 63% year-long learning rate after the RIS/PACS systems were implemented During that period, TAT shrunk by 80%, indicating that most of the benefits of RIS/PACS take time and added effort to be fully realized. The billing process became more authentic and reliable, as all preps procedures, and exams could be captured, and the rate of lost studies decreased from 10% to less that 1%. We documented a steady increase in revenue of more than 3 per procedure per month. Taking into consideration an average rise in charges rates of about 5% annually this gives a pure rate of billing improvement of 1% per month per procedure, not to mention the 20% rise in number of procedures during the first year. Finally, the satisfaction level of referring physicians went up dramatically from around 3 to 6 on a 7-point Likert scale  4.1. Limitations  Implementation of RIS/PACS results in significant cycle-time improvements over the long term throughout the imaging process, and immediate results in the transcription phase offset, in the short term, by increased time requirements while staff learn the new software. These trends drive down costs and enhance revenues under most conditions, although cycle-time reductions may not be sufficient to enable the department to attain industry performance targets Under such circumstances, however, the abundance of information and reporting options within the integrated system make possible financial analysis that can highlight profitable segments of the practice. Practice analysis tools could then uncover new ways to maximize profits by indicating which insurance programs and referring physicians are most profitable This possibility remains to be studied, based on data from a hospital s financial department  4.2. Implications  Several interesting managerial and theoretical implications emerge from our findings. First, good integration of workflow and information system forms the essential basis for any operational improvement on the part of the health-care provider. Having welldefined and well-understood processes gives the ability to respond to changes in market conditions. While defining the metrics and measuring and tracking the process, we could detect improvements in both cycle times and customer satisfaction. We witnessed a significant cycle-time improvements achieved in all phases after implementing RIS/PACS by the department. However, transcription showed an immediate and sharp improvement, while all the rest experienced longer processi ng durations immediately after implementation. This also expands literature as it focuses on the bottleneck alleviation of the process, the transcription, ultimately giving rise to a transformational effect on the service process Tanscriptionists are more professional in using computers than the rest of the staff, so that might explain this rapid pace of improvement. However, as Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 
 


we witnessed, not before long improvements were achieved in all other phases Another important implication of the study is the potential for post-implementation improvements, such as an enhanced interface between the radiology department and other hospital departments and referring physicians. The use of information systems capabilities should lead to developing complementary procedures in all departments, which could elevate the service of the entire health-care facility. A practical managerial take away for radiology, and more generally for IT Implementations at large, is that trained customer's level of satisfaction from a service is dramatically improved given that she actually use the new technology, or get trained and understand process adaptations. We believe that investing in such customer of customer's training, not just customers bares great potential for product success and customers full utilization of product's benefits  Appendices  We conducted a satisfaction survey in RGH s Diagnostic Imaging Department, with the objective of assessing the attitudes and opinions of services postdigital\ided by the department.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual

Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
