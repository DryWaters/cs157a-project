It was designed to simplify the tasks of information management for the organizationsê staff. In this paper, we propose a new recommendation model and algorithm which are based on a faceted classification by level in the aim to facilitate the documentsê indexing. This approach exploits the user trace indexing of his/her documents to learn about the user preferences and then to produce their recommendations. Consequently, these recommendations will provide a kind of knowledge base aiming at improving document  ranking and highlight most relevant information that meeting user  needs. This model is based on a statistical method called Association Rules \(AR\sing an Apriori algorithm to generate the recommendations  Keywords-component; Recommendation; KOS; Hypertagging level;  association rules; facet; tag  I   I NTRODUCTION  Recommender Systems \(RS\ and Information Filtering \(IF are recently used in multiple domains like digital libraries and online advertising. They aim is to present the information movies, music, books, news, images, web pages, etc.\at interest users. In this context, social bookmarking systems and folksonomies uses RS to suggest interesting items for users. A folksonomy is defined by the fact of sharing social resource between different users, while their assigning keywords called tags". These systems are distinguished by the type of resource they support. Among the most popular social bookmarking systems, we cite Flickr 2 and Youtube 3 for media  1 National Agency of Research  2 www.Flickr.org Connotea 4 and CiteUlike 5 for scientific references and del.icio.us 6 for web bookmark sharing. All these bookmarking services use tags to facilitate and to speed up the search and navigation tasks. To assist user in the process of resource describing, recommendation framework are integrated in tagging activity. In the context of NAR  project Miipa-Doc   Methods and Integrated Services for Institutional and Participatory Content Faceted Classification Documentaries complexes\, we develop a new type of Knowledge Organization System \(KOS\alled Hypertagging based on  the tagging of electronic documents and on the principles of faceted classification. According to Gartner Inc, "The company employees spend 30 to 40% of their time to create search, find, rearrange, and organize their documents. To overcome these problems, it is necessary to reduce the cognitive effort of the user and to ease the tracking of good facets and tags to classify its documents. In order to deal with these problems, several researches [2, 3 pr opos e a t a g recommendation solution in the web field \(websites bibliographic resources, social networks links, etc.\hese solutions are only based on us er-resource-tag tripartite graphs and consider only the level of tag. In this paper, we propose an enhancement for the previous solutions. In fact, our solution is based on a new model quadripartite user-resource-facet-tag We tried to exploit the facet lev el consisting in a class of tag in the aim to reduce the number of item by eliminating from the outset not interesting facets In fact, when adding another level that filters items, their computation will be concentrated on relevant items only which provide more precise results In this paper we propose a new model of RS for faceted classification, called by level to assist the user in tagging  3 www.youtube.com 4 www.connetea.org 5 www.citeulike.org 6 www.delicious.com 978-1-4673-2225-6/12/$31.00 ©2012 IEEE 2012 International Conference on Education and e-Learning Innovations 


documents. This approach takes into account the hierarchical structure of KOS faceted \(facets and tags\ addition, tags in KOS system are grouped into classes called Facets or dimensions unlike tags clouds          Therefore, the amount of data processed is significantly lower than baseline. Recommendations are generated at two levels, of the facets in the first time and second time the tags Indeed, we propose a recommendation algorithm inspired from association rules principles. The same algorithm is used to meet two objectives: the recommendation of facets and the recommendation of tags This paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents an overview of the related works in the field of recommendation systems: principles and techniques of the existing recommendation systems, the operating principle of association rules and their ap plication areas We present in section 3 the context of our work especially Hypertagging components. Then, in Section 4 we introduce our model of recommendation per levels in a faceted KOS. We describe in Section 5 the algorithm process. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and present future perspectives of this work II  R ELATED W ORKS  A  Recommendation and bookmarking on line The purpose of a recommendation system is to "recommend items \(also called resources to users related to their preferences and expectations. The aim is both to minimize the time spent on research and to suggest relevant items that would not be consulted spontan eously and increase their overall satisfaction"[5  There are three types of reco mmendation techniques: filtering based on content [1 llab orativ e f ilteri n g  4 and hy brid filtering [13 T h e f i rst t y pe co n s is ts is co m p ari s on bet w e e n the user profile content items, wh ile the second type takes into account the judgment of users on shared items leading to the discovery of neighboring users. The latter type combines both filtering based on content and collaborative filtering The recommendations may be made at two levels: when looking for relevant items or in their indexing step. Unlike works that use tags in the research phase to reformulate and expand the user queries [11 ou r ap p r oach su perv ise s a n d assists the user during the documentary classification in order to suggest appropriate tags in the indexing phase  B  Association rules The method of association rules was introduced by [14 in t h e  aim to analyze the consumerês basket. It is based on rules like If a customer buys milk and bread then he/she will buy in the same time jam". More formally, an association rule takes the form X  Y, where X  I, Y  I, X Y  where I is the set of items. A rule is composed by an X-antecedent and a part composed of a set Y disjoint from X. Two metrics are used to indicate the performance of rules: support and confidence The support shows the proportion of transactions where the itemsets X  Y regarding the whole transactions    Sup \(XY      1   The confidence is the proportion of transactions where the itemsets X  Y regarding the transactions where the itemsets X    Conf \(XY 012 012  2   In the aim to determine the frequent itemsets and to generate recommendations rules through the measurement of support and confidence proposed by the Apriori algo T h is is the first search algorithm of the most frequent pruning including steps to take into acco unt the exponential increase in the number of candidate itemsets Mainly the association rules were used in the marketing field and then it has spread to othe r application areas with different objectives such as: query reformulation in Information Retrieval \(IR\16 th e folksonomiesê structure 17 anal y s i s  of co-occurrences between the terms. In Information Retrieval association rules have been integrated, for example, with ontologies to expand semantic queries [18 and f o r th e improvement of a system of information retrieval in XML documents [19 A ssociatio n ru les are also u s ed f o r t h e  recommendation. Indeed, [20 h a ve develo ped a recommendation system based on the content of the pages already visited by the user \(user trace\ help him in his next surfing in the Web. Moreover, in ey  w e re u s ed to  increase the accuracy of predictions of tags We have some differences from 3 First, the type of input data is different: [3 e p o lar it y  of tags, while we propose a new approach by recommendation levels \(facets and tags\we use tags created freely by the user and considered positive tags Furthermore, the purpose of using association rules is also diff erent. They serve, for them firstly to improve the prediction of tags by extending the queries that are performed with a single tag, and secondly, to increase the rate of return if the URL become rare \(indexed once or twice\. In our approach the association rules are used initially, at the recommendation of facets and tags for users to index documents by tagging already made and in a second step, the discovery and extraction knowledge In this paper, we focus only in the recommendation in the indexing phase. Our work is similar to [20 in th e ope ratin g principle of the user trace to d etermine his/her preferences and  Tags clouds  Facets 


choices on the web, against the recommendation made at the stage of research information an d not in document indexing  III  R ECOMMENDATION BY L EVEL IN THE KOS  F ACETED  A  Work Environment: Hypertagging Structuring elements of Hypertagging are conceptual and graphics constituents that enable users to classify their documents using these components. These components are the views, the Facets \(or dimensions\he tags The views are binders which a set of facets are grouped according on the one hand to share personal views of users, on the other hands to the organization of the company          Figure1  Sets of facets of a researcher- teacher   For example the two views Teaching" and "Research presented in Figure 1 showing an instance of two different views of a teacher-researcher userê activities Each order contains one or more facets. These facets are classes that organize a set of values, depend ing on their nature or terms under which they are considered. One of the original features of the representation of Hypertagging is the tags with icons called SemioTags. In the collaborative environment, these facets can be either an individual facet \(used by one person\ or shared \(used by a group of people\The description of a document relies on tags, values of a facet. Tags are injected as document metadata  B  Computing of correlation level in a KOS-faceted To determine the interests and user preferences, we focus on determining the correlations between the facets and tags The determination of the most frequent itemset is done by the Apriori algorithm The objective is to calculate the correlations between different system components facets and tags\ from the most general \(facet\o the most detailed \(tag\ We rely on the principle considering that: if a facet is common then it necessarily contains frequent tag s. Our approach consists in two levels. The first one is the recommendation of the facets At this level, each classified document will be stored in a database associated with its annotated facet. The second level is the recommendation of tags. At this level, the objective is to extract the most popular tags related by exploiting the correlation of the facets identified above. Figure 2 describes the process of generating correlations. Determining correlations between the facets is via the Apriori algorithm by taking the indexed database BD = \(d 1 d n and the sets of facets F  F mo  F mu as inputs. We obtain as a result the most frequent itemsets \(facets\ and that will be used later to determine the correlation between tags. Indeed the correlation of the facets must be respected in the generation of facet-tags For example, if we obtained after step 1 a correlation between a facet F1 and a facet F2, we consider that each of these facets must be present in the generation of itemsets facets and associated tags   Figure2  Correlation of facets and tags Since there are two types of facets F mo and F mu we improve this algorithm by exploiting this feature of facets to minimize the computational cost. This optimization is built into the stage of joining itemsets. After the generation of frequent itemsets, we do not link tags belonging to a single facet monovalued because these combinations are prohibited by the setting of the facet, and they will not produce rules until the user cannot simultaneously choose his/her tags to classify the document C  Recommendation Algorithm  Definition We consider f  t 015  as the set of facets and tags selected by the user uU to classify its document dD The knowledge base is defined by a set of association rules AR Each AR is defined by a peer  A C  where A is the antecedent part and C is the consequence of the AR  When the user selects the first tag, the system verifies whether the AR has an antecedent part f  t 015  If one or more rules exist then the system suggests to the user a set of f   t  015   where f  t 015  f   t  015   Algorithm Input

The query process of AR is based on repetitive process each time the user tags his/her document. We provide the algorithm of recommendation in the next section  If we suppose that the user has chosen f \(t\= Type of document \(Report\, the recommendation system checks the rules in the database if there is one or more rules as part antecedent containing f \(t\.For exam ple, if we have in the base of the AR following rule Type of document \(report  Activity \(Meeting\ + Project ANR The recommendation system w ill suggest to the user in the first time the facets and Activity Project. Once the user has validated the proposed project facet, the system proceeds to the next level of recommendation to provide the tag ANR. In the next section, we explain the process of recommendation based on association rules in a KOS faceted system  IV  H YPERTAGGING  The main functions of Hypertagging are storage \(naming classification\, treatment \(research\ and communication sharing The functions of capture and creation of documents resources are not included in Hypertagging, there documents are either created by individual tools or collective, accessible workstations as Office suite, CMS \(Content Management System\.. or acquired from external systems through web browsers Structuring elements of Hypertagging are conceptual and functional graphs, which represent a GUI with which the user can classify a document by simply "clicks". These elements can be Views, dimensions and tags Views allow classifying individually or collectively dimensions. This classification is based on mental users classifications in different cont exts. "Product" and "Clients" are examples of views in a commercial enterprise. Each view contains one or more dimensions. These are similar to classes in the sense of classification\ and contain multiple values These values are the tags, represented as icons A dimension can appear in multiple views. It can be multivalued \(the user has set for it several tags\or single-valued limited to a single tag\. Compared to the collaborative aspects a dimension can be individual or shared. It can contribute to the naming of a document \(in the case where the user chooses that this dimension name appears in the naming of the document The description of a document is based on the tags, the values of a dimension. Tags are injected as document metadata Metadata is a fundamental component of the conceptual document classification. They are among the main concepts of the prototype Hypertagging, necessary to support the search functions of classified documents. There are two solutions to associate metadata to resources internally and externally method  V  C ONCLUSION   In this paper we de velop a new approach for automatic recommendation of facets in our KOS Hypertagging for documentary ranking. Our model can learn over time the habits and preferences of us ers via the operating trace of indexing. This approach allows for easier indexing of documents to the user by suggesting recommendations that meet their needs and expectatio ns. We believe that cold start problem is an important issue that we should deal with The applied approach of recommendation makes hypothesis that users have enough tagged documents with facets and tags to allow the system to learn and start the process of recommendation The perspectives of this work aim to extend this recommendation technique in a document sharing environment and facets-tags in a group of users. To conclude our approach differs from other existing works on recommendation by proposing a new model of association rules including a facet lev el added to the tags level    R EFERENCES   1  M.

In all of our experiments, we use 10-fold cross-validation on all datasets except for the datasets of spect and ionosphere which provide test datasets in addition to training datasets We use the method proposed by Aliferis et al.

In the experiments, we set the minimum confidence threshold to 0.8 for CBA and CMAR, and set the growth rate to 20 for CAPE and our CEEP and MB-EP classifiers. To thoroughly test the impact of the support threshold values, we set seven minimum supports for CE-EP, MB-EP, CAEP, CBA, and CMAR including 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 respectively. We select the best classification accuracy under the seven minimum supports as the results for our comparative study. The EP classifier based on strong jumping EP uses the minimal support threshold suggested in the original paper [1  T h e p a ram eters  f o r  C P A R ar e  se t th e  same as those reported in [2 A, CM AR  a nd C P AR ar e implemented in the LOCS KDD software [24 in  J a v a  w h ile  CE-EP, MB-EP and CAEP are implemented in C++.

Table IV summarizes win/tie/loss counts for comparing our two classifiers with the other classifiers.  As shown in Tables III and IV, our two classifiers, CE-EP and MB-EP, usually outperform CAEP SJEP, CBA, CMAR, and CPAR. Although CE-EP only considers mining the classification rules from the space of the direct causes and direct effects of the class label, it outperforms not only MB-EP, but also SJEP, CBA, CMAR and CPAR. Empirical results indicate that detecting cause effect relationships can find high quality predictive rules to achieve better accuracy.

achieves a higher predictive accuracy than the existing associative classifiers. Table V also indicates that even with very high-dimensional datasets, CE-EP and MB-EP only select a very small set of rules while CAEP, CBA, and CMAR cannot deal with those datasets, even with a rather high support value When the support value is up to 0.2, CBA and CMAR classifiers donêt select any rules on the australia and liver  datasets. Moreover, on the madelon dataset, CMAR also cannot select any rules. On the promoters dataset, although CBA and CMAR select a very small set of rules of 5 and 8 rules respectively, their corresponding classification accuracy is very low, only up to 15% and 2 Table VI compares the running time of our two classifiers with the CAEP, CBA, and CMAR classifiers with the minimum support thresholds up to 0.2. The best result is highlighted in bold face. The CE-EP and MB-EP classifiers are always faster than CAEP. Compared to CBA and CMAR with the same minimum support threshold, on some small datasets, such as breast-w, pima and vote CBA and CMAR are faster than CE-EP and MB-EP. On some datasets, such as australia  live and promoters although CBA and CMAR are faster than CE-EP and MB-EP, CBA and CMAR almost donêt select any rules and only achieve very low accuracy The running time of CBA and CMAR fluctuates among different datasets while CE-EP has a very stable running time for both small and large datasets TABLE VI    R UNNING TIME OF FIVE ASSOCIATIVE CLASSIFIERS IN SECOND  SUPPORT 0.2  Datasets CE-EP MB-EP CAEP CBA CMAR australia 12.58 12.58 14.67 0.14 3.072 breast-w 13.222 13.222 13.222 0.5 0.187 heart 10.28 10.28 13.08 0.36 0.438 infant_mortality 14.36 15.11 3557.41 10.047 ionosphere 8.55 11.56 19.5 208.67 51.516 kr_vs_kp 13 29.36 287.08 97.49 13.25 liver 10 10 10.51 0 0 mushroom 16.94 41.49 46.92 22.31 335.188 pima 10.49 10.49 10.49 0.25 0.062 promoters 12.39 13.39 5.83 5.9 spect 8.36 8.36 10.22 0.86 2.828 spectf 12.95 12.95 2375.63 5.406 vote 10.22 10.22 10.922 1.36 11.11 wdbc 13.59 13.84 48.39 111.42 226.219 madelon 12.86 13  20 hiva 13.14 13.25   lymphoma 10.8 10.8   breast-cancer 46.7 145   ovarian-cancer 13.8 20.8   dorothea 160.4 1789.2    D  Sensitivity Analysis on Support Thresholds  To further explore the performance of CE-EP, MB-EP CAEP, CBA and CMAR, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the classification accuracy, number of selected rules, and running time of those five classifiers with seven minimum support threshold values    1  Sensitivity analysis on classification accuracy  We plot the classification accuracy of those five classifiers on the twenty datasets with seven support thresholds, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 As illustrated in Fig.2, we can see that CE-EP, MB-EP and CAEP are less sensitive to the support thresholds than CBA and CMAR. For all datasets, both CE-EP and MB-EP are insensitive to the different support thresholds, even for those high-dimensional datasets. Furthermore, CE-EP is not only more insensitive, but also always achieves a higher accuracy under all the seven support thresholds than CAEP CBA, and CMAR on all datasets except mushroom and wdbc

   Figure 2  The classification accuracy of five associative classifers under different support threshold values on 20 datasets On the other hand, CBA and CMAR are very sensitive to the support thresholds. For example, on all the datasets except for infant-mortality and spectf when the support threshold is up to 0.3 or 0.4, the corresponding accuracy is greatly reduced. Moreover, on some datasets, the accuracy of CBA and CMAR is even reduced to 0, such as australia kr-vs-kp, liver, promoter and spect On the infant-mortality  and spectf datasets, CBA can only work on the support value greater than 0.2 From the above results, CE-EP and MB-EP are insensitive to the support thresholds. We have a further sensitivity analysis on the number of selected rules in the next section  2  Sensitivity analysis on the number of selected rules  We plot the number of selected rules of CE-EP, MB-EP CAEP, CBA and CMAR on some datasets with the various support thresholds, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 in Fig. 3, instead of all the twenty datasets due to the page limit. From Fig.3, we can see that the numbers of selected rules of CBA and CMAR are very sensitive to the support thresholds. With a small support value, CBA and CMAR select a large number of classification rules. With the support value increasing, the number of selected rules is greatly reduced. Along with Fig. 2, we can conclude that when the support value is small, CBA and CMAR can obtain a large number of rules for classification to achieve good accuracy as shown in Fig. 2. When the support value is large, CBA and CMAR prune too many rules, including useful rules, and this results low classification accuracy From Figures 2 and 3, it is clear that with a small support value, a large number of rules provide rich information for classification and make CBA and CMAR achieve high accuracy. Unfortunately, with a big support value, a large number of rules are generated, and they are difficult to store retrieve and maintain for classification. For example, in Fig 2, on the infant-mortality and spectf datasets, CBA doesnêt work under a small support value because of a huge number of rules CAEP is less sensitive to the support value than CBA and CMAR. Therefore, CAEP also gets a more stable performance than CBA and CMAR under the different support values as shown in Fig. 2. But CAEP cannot deal with a high-dimensional dataset, even on the spectf dataset As for CE-EP and MB-EP, especially CE-EP, under all seven support thresholds, CE-EP and MB-EP not only select a small set of rules, but also are insensitive to the support threshold, even on those very high-dimensional datasets Therefore, those results further demonstrate that the importance of introducing causality into associative classification. More especially, when CE-EP and MB-EP mine the classification rules from the space of the direct causes and direct effects or Markov blanket of the class label they can achieve strongly predictive rules no matter whether the support value is small or large. This also explains why the accuracy of CE-EP and MB-EP remains stable under the different support thresholds as shown in Fig. 2 Although Fig. 3 only contains eight datasets, the results on the remaining twelve datasets have a similar trend Therefore, in a word, among those five associative 
921 


classifiers, as for the number of selected rules, CE-EP and MB-EP are the most insensitive classifiers to the support thresholds while CBA and CMAR are the most sensitive ones. CAEP is less sensitive than CBA and CMAR   Figure 3  Number of selected rules with varied support thresholds  3  Sensitivity analysis on running time  Fig. 4 shows the running time of the five classifiers under seven support values, on the same eight datasets as in Fig.3. From Fig. 4, we can see that the running time of CAEP, CBA, and CMAR is very sensitive to different support thresholds, especially CBA and CMAR. In Table VI we report the running time of those five classifiers under the support value up to 0.2. CBA and CMAR are much faster than CE-EP and MB-EP on some small datasets. The running time of CE-EP and MB-EP is also insensitive to the support values while the running time of the CBA and CMAR classifiers fluctuates under the different support values   Figure 4  Running time with varied support thresholds E  Comparison of classification accuracy of our classifiers with the other state-of-the-art  classifiers  Table VII compares the accuracy of our two classifiers against well-known classifiers such as decision tree J48 Naive Bayes \(NB\, ensemble classifiers Bagging and Boosting implemented in Weka. We also present a win/tie/loss summary in Table VIII to compare the overall performance of our two classifiers against each other. From Tables VII and VIII, both CE-EP and MB-EP achieve the highest accuracy on the 9 data sets of the 20 data sets respectively. On the remaining data sets, while our two classifiers are not the best, they achieve the accuracy very close to the highest on most of these 11 data sets. Our two

Meanwhile, how to deal with high sensitivity to the minimal support threshold is another challenging problem. In this paper, we bring causality into play when designing associative classifiers and propose a new framework for associative classification. In order to validate our framework, we use EP-based classifiers as baseline methods to instantiate our framework and propose two causal associative classifiers: CE-EP and MB-EP Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework Meanwhile, we have only instantiated our framework on EP-based classifiers. Exploring our framework in general association rule classifiers is our future work A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(60975034, 61070131, 61175051 and 61005007\, the US National Science Foundation \(CCF0905337\, and the US NASA Research Award NNX09AK86G  R EFERENCES  1  H.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
