INTRODUCTION Findingtheassociationruleisoneofthemosttargetsof datamining,itsgoalisdiscovering allfrequentpatternsand strong association rules in the data set. At present it has widely applied in the network advertisement cheat, the commodity shelf layout, the traffic accident analysis, the insurancebusiness,disease forecasts, teachingappraisaland so on. Now ripe mining  association rule algorithms are about BOOLEAN data[5,6], in fact there are lots of quantative attributes in the database.Quantitative attributes must be divided several disperse intervals when mining association rules. It maybe bring the incisive boundary problem.Inordertosolvethisproblemsomedomesticand foreign scholars introdued the fuzzyset concept into fuzzy association rule  algorithms[1,712].The common fuzzy association rule mining algorithms are all based on the Apriori algorithm.

n-dimension data cube\( I1  I k Support=sup_count/total_count 2 3 4. Performance Analysis Example 2 Lets talk about a practical problem just like the status of sales. Assume that we will mine the association rules involved 4 dimension attributes of sales, the minsup=25%. First of all, using OLAP technology to build a 4-D data cube and the 4 dimension attributes are: time location, item, and supplier. For location dimension which contains area, country and so on, we choose province level We use brand level for item dimension, company level for supplier dimension. Time dimension can be divided as Q1 1-3 4-6 7-9 10-12 location\(P1,P2,L1,L2 York, item\(B1,B2,B3,B4 C1,C2,C3 sales data cube can be generalized like this Graphic 2: The 4-Dimension Data Cube of Sales The details of this sales data cube are in the table follow: The amount of cells is 100 Location Time Item Supplier Count Cell-1 P1 Q1 B1 C2 5 Cell-2 P1 Q3 B1 C1 2 Cell-99 L1 Q3 B1 C1 3 Cell-100 L2 Q4 B1 C3 11 Table 2: The details data table of sales data cube We use original Apriori_Cube Algorithm to find frequent predicate set with minsup_num= 25%*100=25 According the data table we calculate that sup_count of every member of dimension L is \(P1:8, P2:5, L1:1, L2:24 and also T, I, S. So there is the process Graphic 3: The processes of old algorithm As we know, through comparing with the minsup_num dimension location has no one frequent 1-predicate set, so that there have no frequent 4-predicate set in the output by the original algorithm. But users are interested in the Candidate 1-Predicate set L T I S P1 P2 L1 


L2 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 B1 B2 B3 B4 C1 C2 C3 Frequent 1-Predicate set T I S Q1 Q3 B2 B3 C1 C2 I1 I 2 C1              C2                 C3 2 12 1 3 5 1 6 2 12 8 11 Q 1  Q 2  Q 3  Q 4 P 1 P 2 L 1 L 2 Candidate 2-Predicate set Q1,B2},{Q1,B3 Q1,C1},{Q1,C2 Q3,B2},{Q3,B3 


Q3,C1},{Q3,C2 Candidate 3-Predicate set Q1,B2,B3}{Q 1,Q3,B2},{Q3 C1,B2 Frequent 2-Predicate set Q1,B2}{Q1,B 3},{Q3,B2 Q3,C1 Output: 1L U 2L U 3L Frequent 3-Predicate set Q1,B2,C1},{Q1,B3,B2 Q1,B2,B3  6 level from the same dimension and SP to pruning Candidate 3 Set, pruning {Q1,Q3,B2}, keep {Q1,B2,B3} due to the special requirement on location B by users 7 1 max_support of every dimension 1 frequent 4-predicate set which contains location dimension And the candidate 3-predicate set {Q1,Q3,B2} is useless because when we mine multi-dimension association rules we should follow that one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension even the sup_count >minsup_num when there are no requirements from users. But this time, users require that different members from dimension item can exist at the same time So we redo this mining process by the improved Algorithm Graphic 4: The processes of improved algorithm At last, we got the frequent 4-predicate set which the users are interested in, and then can format the rules 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size 


of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.

But this time, users require that different 


members from dimension item can exist at the same time So we redo this mining process by the improved Algorithm Graphic 4: The processes of improved algorithm At last, we got the frequent 4-predicate set which the users are interested in, and then can format the rules 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.
