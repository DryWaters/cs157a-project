Simulation validation in particular is the process of determining the degree to which a model or simulation is an accurate representation of the real-world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model or simulation 3  Simulations are by definition approximations or abstractions of the real world.  Specifying them involves determining the set of entities of interest to be simulated and the accuracy of representation For verification, simulation software can be tested against its requirements by a vari ety of mature software methodologies not covered in this paper. The simulation 
community has made considerable advances in defining uncertainty, fidelity and validity of simulations.   When these parameters can be quantified and measured, traditional software testing techniques can be profitably applied However, even if a simulation is certified to implement its requirements exactly, that does not measure the credibility  2 Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Volume 8 Revised as of April 1 2008 Subpart A--General Provisi ons Sec. 820.3 Definitions 3 Committee on Standards American Aeronautics and Astronautics \(AIAA from Obercampf 2002 


  2 of simulation results for a particular use. When NASA analysts could not state the credibility of simulations used to predict the success of the Shuttle launches, the Chief Engineer commissioned a standard for models and simulations.  The resulting NASA-STD-7009 recognizes the importance of measuring the credibility of the final results of a simulation study and reporting these results unambiguously with a Credibility Assessment Scale.  The assessment scale measures, among other things, the credibility of the verification and validation performed on the software that implements the simulation This paper describes how thes e considerations were taken into account in developing the Orion Modeling and Simulation VV&A process, where accreditation refers to the process of certifying that a model and simulation is appropriate to a particular intended use 2  R ELATIONSHIPS  The relationships between Systems Engineering, Software Engineering and M&S are shown in Figure 1.  The figure illustrates that while there are commonalities and overlap between systems engineering, M&S and software engineering, there is also uniqueness.  Each discipline has its own Body of Knowledge.  Each has its own methodologies Figure 1:  Three Distinct Domains Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed. Issues such as logistics, the coordination of different teams, and automatic control of machinery become more difficult when dealing with large, complex projects Systems engineering deals with work-processes and tools to handle such projects, and it overlaps with both technical and human-centered disciplines such as control engineering and project management 4   4 http://en.wikipedia.org wiki/Systems_engineering Software engineering is the application of a systematic disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software 5  Universities have recently added advanced and undergraduate degrees in Modeling and Simulation.  M&S education is fast becoming a recognized discipline within academe and industry. And as a discipline it has experienced a top-down approach with regard to academic programs that have their origins at the graduate level Programs have grown from graduate M&S courses in such diverse fields as Engineer ing, Operations Research Economics and Sociology 3  S IMULATION AND S OFTWARE C OMPARED  A simulation is a representation of the operation or features of one process or system through the use of another 6 The system or process being represented is the referent.  Many modern simulations are implemented in software 7 These may profit from good Software Engineering practices and modern software testing techniques, but the focus of this paper is the unique aspects of testing M&S.  Simulations are by the very definition a representation of the referent.  They are abstract or they would be copies.  In fact the very abstraction is critical to their use - but how much abstraction? How well does the M&S need to match the referent?  In what aspects of behavior or constituency How accurately?  What fidelity?  These terms are difficult to define much less specify as testable requirements A classic example from the aerospace industry is the difference between a simulation of a rocket engine and the software used to control the engine.  The rocket engine may be simulated with a system of partial differential equations It will be a representation of the operation of the engine The inconsistencies caused by assumptions like laminar flow or inaccuracies in the e quation solver may combine to produce an uncertainty in the estimate of performance, but that uncertainty may be perfec tly acceptable.  On the other hand the software used to control the engine must be predictably error free Software is verified and validated by rigorous processes Software verification is confirmation by examination and provisions of objective eviden ce that software meets its specifications.

  3 examination and provision of objective eviden ce that the particular requirements for a specific intended use are fulfilled.  NASA Software Independent Verification and Validation \(IV&V\is an Agency-wide strategy to provide the highest achievable levels of safety and costeffectiveness for mission critical software Likewise M&S are verified and validated by rigorous processes that are adapted for the unique nature of M&S M&S verification is the process of determining that a model or simu plem entation accurately represents the developer\222s conceptual description and specification.  M&S validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model [or simu is an accurate representation of the real-world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model or simulation.  The subtle difference deals with that tricky aspect of fidelity 4  NASA\222 S M&S  S TANDARD   The genesis of NASA\222s recent emphasis on assuring the validity of simulations and the credibility of simulation studies is depicted in Figure 2 Columbia Accident Investigation Board \(CAIB A Renewed Commitment to Excellence Diaz Report Return-to-Flight Task Group Stafford-Covey Report M&S VV&A Team Initiated October 2005 NASA Chief Engineer Memo, Sept. 2006  Figure 2:  Drivers for the Simulation Standard The Columbia Accident Investigation Report \(CAIB\ called for NASA to \223develop, validate, and maintain physicsbased computer models to evaluate Thermal Protection System damage from debris impacts. These tools should provide realistic and timely estimates of any impact damage from possible debris from any source that may ultimately impact the Orbiter. Establish impact damage thresholds that trigger responsive corrective action, such as on-orbit inspection and repair, when indicated.\224 The Diaz Report broadened the scope beyond STS.  Action Item Number 4 called for NASA to \223develop a standard for the development, documentation, and operation of models and simulations; documentation, configuration management, and quality assurance; verification and validation, operational data a nd trending; tool management maintenance, and obsolescence; training requirements, best practices for user interfaces; a nd user feedback when results appear unrealistic\224 The Stafford-Covey report enjoined \223formal development verification and validation, and outside review plans.\224 It said that assumptions should be written down and consistently applied.   Sensitivity analysis and careful analysis of uncertainty was to be performed The Chief Engineer\222s Memo required that the credibility of M&S results is properly conveyed to those making critical decisions, that analysts should assure that the credibility of M&S meets the project requirements. NASA was to establish M&S requirements and recommendations that will form a strong foundation for disciplined \(structure management, control\developm ent, validation and use of M&S within NASA and its contractor community, include a standard method to assess the credibility of the M&S presented to the decision maker when making critical decisions \(i.e., decisions that effect human safety or mission success\using results from M&S, and establish a common set of terms and a uniform way for M&S practitioners to communicate the credibility of M&S 5  R EQUIREMENTS FROM NASA-STD-7009 NASA-STD-7009 requires that the presentation of any results from M&S to a decision maker include \(1 estimate of the results, \(2\st atement on the uncertainty in the results, \(3\e evaluation of the results on the credibility assessment scale, and \(4 any explicit caveats that accompany the results. \(An exam ple of such a caveat would be use of the model in violation of its assumptions decision maker then makes his/her own assessment of credibility based upon all four pieces of information in the context of the decision at hand as shown in Figure 3. This is intended to provide a standard method to assess the credibility of the models and simulations presented to the decision maker when making critical decisions \(i.e decisions that effect human safety or mission success\ng results from models and simulations and to assure that the credibility of models and simulations meet the project requirements

This CAS consists of eight factors grouped into three categories.  The assessment process involves evaluating the M&S results on each of eight factors, and then rolling up these eight factor results into a single number that represents the summary credibility assessment.  The M&S Development category captures those aspects of the M&S that pertain to the general assessment of the credibility of the M&S for their broad intended use; the M&S Operations addresses the aspects relevant to the current application of the M&S to generate the particular M&S results under assessment; and the Supporting Evidence category addresses three cross-cutting factors The credibility assessment scale does not purport to measure credibility; rather, it assesses the M&S results, and the rigor of the processes used to produce them, against key factors that affect the credib ility judgment. The fundamental premise of this approach is that as a general rule, the more rigorous the key processes used for generating the M&S results, the greater the credibility of the M&S results, all else \(including the estimated uncertainty\ng equal  Supporting Evidence  M&S Operations  M&S Development Verification Validation Input Pedigree Results Uncertainty Results Robustness Use History M&S Management People Qualifications M&S Results Credibility Body of Evidence Technical Review Body of Evidence Technical Review Body of Evidence Technical Review Body of Evidence Technical Review Body of Evidence Technical Review  Figure 4: The Credibility Assessment Scale from NASA-STD-7009  


  5 The M&S Operations category deals with the credibility factors for the application of this particular computational model in the generation of the current M&S results. This includes the conduct of the present simulation and the analysis and reporting of the results. The Supporting Evidence category covers the use history of the particular computational model employed in the M&S; the overall management of the M&S processes; and the qualifications of the people involved in the development, operation, and analysis of the computational model 6  C ONSTELLATION I MPLEMENTATION  The Constellation Program developed the process shown in Figure 5 to meet the requirements of NASA-STD-7009. The Three-Phase VV&A Process was developed to work within NASA\222s dynamic and diverse environment.  Designed specifically to accommodate each unique situation, this process allows the practitioner to evaluate and determine which activities are relevant to their needs.  It also allows for necessary information gathering and subsequent planning before committing to V&V activities that can be cost and resource-intensive.  To determine the types and amount of evidence needed to en sure credibility, it is critical to understand the program need\(s\hat the M&S is supporting, as well as the ability of the M&S to fulfill those needs.  The phased approach addresses this, rather than assuming that a full VV&A effo rt is necessary in every situation, and provides management with the information necessary to make critical decisions. Breaking the VV&A activities up into discernable phases allows the practitioner or manager to determine whether to accredit the M&S based on evidence in existence at that time, or proceed to the next phase  Phase 1 Initialization VV&A Process VV&A Process Phase 2 Planning Phase 3 Execution VV&A Process OUTPUTS User INPUTS 225 Design Requirements 225 Data Analysis 225 Design Requirements 225 Data Analysis How Good Does it Need to Be 225 M&S Requirements 225 M&S Designs 225 M&S Code 225 M&S Data 225 M&S Use 225 M&S Requirements 225 M&S Designs 225 M&S Code 225 M&S Data 225 M&S Use M&S Tool Artifacts M&S Tool Artifacts Developer INPUTS How Good Is it VV&A Process INPUTS Decision Decision Decision 225 Capability Report 225 Credibility Assessment 225 Estimate for Phase 2 225 Memo 225 Accreditation Plan 225 V&V Plan 225 Memo 225 V&V Report 225 Accreditation Report 225 Memo 225 Capability Report 225 Credibility Assessment 225 Estimate for Phase 2 225 Memo 225 Accreditation Plan 225 V&V Plan 225 Memo 225 V&V Report 225 Accreditation Report 225 Memo NASA Standard for M&S, NASA-STD-7009 M&S VV&A Recommended Practices Guide  Figure 5: The Constellation Program\222s Three-Phase VV&A Process A never-before-assessed but existing M&S may already have all the V&V evidence need ed to accredit.  When the evidence is assessed and perhaps documented in a capability assessment, the M&S may be accredited following initialization.  If not, additional verification and validation activates may be planned in the second phase. After planning, which includes an estimate of required resources it may be discovered that the program lacks the resources to accomplish the new V&V activities at the time Management may elect to use the M&S with the understanding that additional V V was needed but not yet performed.  Finally there is the decision after the execution of the new V&V activities 8   8 A more complete discussion of this process is in the NASA VV&A 7  O RION I MPLEMENTATION  The mission of the Orion Modeling and Simulation Office OM&SO\ ensure that th e Orion Project has adequate modeling capabilities to support spacecraft design implementation, test, and operations activities: safely accurately, and efficiently The OM&SO developed an approach to implement M&S standards to support important Orion design decisions and verification of system requirements.

Simulationspecific validation concerns include the M&S being fit to its intended use, validation against experimental data uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis Traditional software testing techniques must be augmented with credibility assessment techniques that address these unique concerns.

The FST algorithm must preserve the property of orthogonality between the different frequencies. Additionally, any noise present even after rectifica tion will be mitigated by the summation process. Thus for this  technique, mathematically, crosstalk from adjacent frequencies will be zero and the SO S time record length can be as short as one period of the lowest fre quency. However, the FST method only works if the octave harmonic relationship holds for all frequencies in the SOS including the sample frequency. This en sures that over a period of any frequency present in the SOS there will always be an even number of samples. The implementa tion of the rectification functions with discrete signals in a manner that preserves orthogonality between different frequencies is developed within this paper
