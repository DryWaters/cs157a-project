The performance optimization of MapReduce\nprograms is challenging because it requires a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the whole system including both hardware\nlayers \(processors, storages, networks and etc operating systems, JVM, runtime, applications and etc optimiza-\ntion are based on empirical and heuristic attempts.

In addition to\nthe best practice on performance tuning, several key findings are\nsummarized as valuable workload analysis for JVM, MapReduce\nruntime and application design.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBig data is changing the world. It is more than simply\na matter of size, but also great opportunities and insights.\nMapReduce [4] and Hadoop play a critical role in the big\ndata era. The success of Hadoop is well recognized in the\ncommunity and has triggered dozens of famous projects and\ncompanies, such as the Cloudera Hadoop [3] and the IBM\nBigInsights [10].\nAmong the topics related to Hadoop, the performance at-\ntracts many attentions from both academia and industries. With\na given hardware and setup, a better performance is always\ndesired. Many works reveal that currently lots of MapReduce\nprograms suffer from performance issues However the per-\nformance optimization of MapReduce programs is not trivial.\nIt is because the performance is impacted by both hardware\nlayers \(processors, storages, networks and etc operating systems, JVM, runtime, applications and\netc to\nsignificant performance variation. Cross layer settings are also\nhighly coupled which make the tuning intractable. Although\nthere are many works on Hadoop performance tuning, it still\nremains a blank on how to build a systematical framework\nwhich performs whole system optimizations.\nIn this paper, we present a performance evaluation frame-\nwork for whole system optimization which correlates perfor-\nmance metrics from different layers. This framework is built\non deep analysis of each layer in the hardware and software\nstacks and extensive experimental experiences. It is composed\nof a series of predefined patterns, each pattern indicates\none or more potential performance issue. The behavior of\nMapReduce programs is captured and correlated with resource\nutilization. This framework provides a holistic approach to\nevaluate MapReduce program efficiency. It allows users at\ndifferent levels of experience to conduct MapReduce program\nperformance optimization.\nThe framework is verified by Terasort benchmark in our\nexperiments. With the help of the framework, we we finally get\nthe Terasort result improved from 47 mins to less than 8 mins\non a 10-node Power7R2 cluster. Our normalized performance\nis 0.21GB sorted/node/sec, while the normalized performance\nof the Terasort world record held by Microsoft Research is\n0.10GB sorted/node/sec [2].\nThe contribution of the paper can be briefly summarized as:\n1 correlate performance metrics\nfrom different layers and efficiently pinpoint the potential\nperformance issues for whole system optimization.\n2 presented to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the framework.\n3 performance is\nsummarized and shared.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section\nII presents the analysis of each layer. Section III introduces\nthe proposed evaluation framework. Section IV demonstrates\nits effectiveness. Section V summarizes the best practice\nof achieving best Terasort performance Related works and\nconclusions are presented at Section VI and Section VII,\nrespectively.\nII. STACK ANALYSIS\nA typical MapReduce program runs on a stack that can be\nabstracted into six layers. Analytic libraries lie on the top of\n978-1-4799-1235-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE                               126 Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design\n\nthe stack, which are always designed for specific industrial\nrequirements. MapReduce programs lie in the second layer,\nwhere the programmers could develop MapReduce programs.\nMoreover, several high-level languages such as JAQL[1] could\nalso be used to generate MapReduce programs. A MapReduce\nruntime is at the third layer, such as Hadoop, BigInsights, and\nPlatform 


Symphony, etc. The fourth layer is JVM runtime.\nOn the bottom, operating system and hardware architecture\nserves as the fifth and sixth layer, respectively. Here we\nhighlight some important factors that have big impacts on the\nperformance.\nA. Hardware Architecture\n1 archi-\ntecture. Fully exploiting CPU’s computation power is the\nfirst priority to achieve high system resource utilization. Our\nperformance tuning shows that Simultaneously Multithreading\n\(SMT Prefetching are very important to\nthe performance of MapReduce programs. For instance, IBM\nPOWER7 processor provides three different SMT modes: 1-\nway, 2-way and 4-way [15]. The purpose of using SMT is to\nincrease processor pipeline utilization by hiding the latency\nof pipeline stall events such as last level cache miss Besides\nSMT, POWER7 processor also offers advanced data prefetch\nengine that conceals the latency of retrieving data. Power7\nprefetch engine can recognize sequential data access pattern\nand stride-N patterns and initiate prefetching of data from L2\nor L3 cache or memory to L1 cache to improve the overall\nperformance.\n2 128GB per node in our cluster How to allocate memory\nto tasks is critical to the performance of a MapReduce pro-\ngram. Detailed discussion will be included in section IV.\n3 is very important to hide the disk I/O\nlatency as much as possible. A common practice is to overlap\nthe disk I/O with computation. In addition, there are some\nconfigurations of the disk sub-systems which have impacts\non the performance, such as disk I/O scheduling policy, read\nahead buffer. How to adjust these parameters to achieve best\nperformance depends on the characteristics of the workloads.\n4 key component in\nMapReduce due to several reasons. First, the performance of\nshuffle phase greatly relies on the performance of the network.\nSecond, the network also determines the performance of\ndistributed file system e.g., HDFS performance\nbottleneck.\nB. Software Stack\n1 OS abstraction to the upper layer software. Many hard-\nware features can be exploited by the software via APIs\nprovided by the OS. For example, the SMT mode, disk I/O\nscheduling policy and read ahead buffer, huge page table can\nall be set by APIs or command lines provided by the OS.\n2 critical role in\nserving the upper-layer Hadoop run-time. In fact, there are\nmany JVM level parameters which could be used for Hadoop\nperformance tuning, such as JIT policy, garbage collection\npolicy, heap size, and lock reservation option. For Hadoop\nMapReduce tasks, it is important to fully utilize all available\nmemory so as to eliminate unnecessary disk I/O operations.\n3 parameters available for tuning. Based on our exper-\niments, the most critical parameters to the performance fall\ninto following categories: resource sharing between Map and\nReduce, buffer allocation for intermediate data, task schedul-\ning for timing and number of launching Reduce tasks, and I/O\ncontrol to reduce I/O operations.\n4 recommended to think\nabout whether a more efficient algorithm can be used. A better\nalgorithm might deliver much higher performance gain than\nother tuning.\nIII. CROSS-LAYER PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nFRAMEWORK FOR WHOLE-SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION\nIn this section, we introduce cross-layer performance eval-\nuation framework, which is shown in Table I. It is composed\nof three patterns, and each pattern indicates one or more\npotential performance issues at a wide range. The key idea\nof this framework is to correlate the application behavior with\ncorresponding resource utilization.\nA. Pattern 1: Spill Efficiency\nIn this group, we define a pair of evaluation index\n<NSpillRecord, Umemory/heap>. NSpillRecord is the appli-\ncation index which represents the number of spill record\nand Umemory/heap is the resource index which reflects the\nmemory utilization. These indexes work together to evaluate\nMapReduce program Spill phase efficiency. Figure 1 shows an\nexample of this pattern.\nFault tolerance is one of the major design considerations of\nHadoop. To avoid successful task performed repeatedly during\nunexpected failure, all the outputs of Map tasks are written to\ndisk. The Reduce phase fetches the intermediate data from\ncorresponding mappers. During this process, spill and merge\nhappen.\nBoth the Spill and Merge involve many I/O operations\nwhich are very time consuming. Thus, it is very likely that\nSpill and Merge become performance bottleneck. So how\nmany spill records determines the overall performance to a\ngreat extend. This is why we choose NSpillRecord as the\napplication index to evaluate the spill efficiency.\nIn Figure 1 NSpillRecord shows not only how many records\nhave been spilled, but also how many rounds of merge occurs.\nThis value is easy to monitor as it is a standard counter in\nHadoop job. The optimization goal for Map phase is that\nthe NSpillRecord equals to NMapOutputRecord, which means\nit only spills one time. The optimization goal for Reduce\nphase is slightly different. NSpillRecord is ideally close to zero.\nTABLE I\nEVALUATION FRAMEWORK DEFINITION\npattern Description Potential Inefficiency Cause\nSpill Efficiency NSpillRecord: the number of Spill Record in Map/Reduce phase JVM related parameters\n 


NSpillRecord,Umemory/heap > Umemory/heap: system memory or JVM heap utilization Runtime buffer parameters\nScheduling Efficiency TShuffleTail: timing for end of Map phase Runtime scheduling parameters\n TShuffleTail,UNetwork > to the last reduce \(in first wave Function Efficiency CSupporting : cost of support functions Application Algorithm\n< CSupporting ,UCPU/disk UCPU/disk: utilization of CPU and disk I/O\nFig. 1. Pattern 1: Spill Efficiency\nIf NSpillRecord is significantly more than reduce records, it\nmeans this job is hitting multiple merge passes, which is very\nexpensive.\nFrom the resource point of view, the system memory\nusage and java heap usage are closely linked together with\nNSpillRecord. Considered as a whole, whether the memory is\nutilized efficiently in Spill phase can be easily found out. If\nNSpillRecord is larger than NMapOutputRecord in Map phase\nor NSpillRecord is larger than zero in Reduce phase while the\nmemory utilization is not high enough, it indicates a potential\nmemory under-utilization issue. It is recommended to first\ninvestigate whether Java heap size is assigned with a proper\nvalue, and then check whether Spill related buffer parameters\nare set properly. This pattern gives an overview of memory\nutilization of spill phase in a MapReduce program.\nB. Pattern 2 Scheduling Efficiency\nIn this pattern, we define an evaluation pattern\n<TShuffleTail, Unetwork>. TShuffleTail is the application\nindex which represents the time period from the end of Map\nphase to the start of last reducer \(in first wave activity during TShuffleTail. This pattern works\ntogether to demonstrate how well the MapReduce program\nbehaves on fetching intermediate data.\nOverlap is the key feature of MapReduce program. The\nshuffle phase can start as early as the first map ends. Figure\n2 illustrates how the program executes. The shuffle phase\nconsists of two parts: one is to copy intermediate data from\nmappers, the other is to wait for mappers to complete. Based\nFig. 2. Pattern 2: Shuffle Efficiency\non this understanding, we define TShuffleTail to indicate how\nlong it takes to copy intermediate data after the Map phase\nends.\nThe performance optimization becomes more clear based\non this pattern. Changes to shorten TShuffleTail have great\npotential to improve the overall performance. From the pro-\ngram efficiency point of view, network is a key factor during\nTShuffleTail For data intensive workload, network throughput\nis prone to be performance bottleneck. So this pattern is\nconsidered as a whole to identify the real performance issue.\nC. Pattern 3: Supporting Function Efficiency\nIn this group, we define a pair of evaluation\nindex <CSupportingFunction, UCPU/disk Here\nCSupportingFunction denotes the supporting function cost\nand UCPU/disk represents the CPU and disk utilization. This\npattern works together to evaluate the supporting functions\nefficiency of hadoop runtime Figure 3 illustrates an example\nof this pattern.\nOther than user-defined Map/Reduce functions, the func-\nFig 3.

Here we select the most frequently\nused supporting functions, like Compression/Decompression,\nPartition and Serialization. During optimization attentions\nneeds to be paid on the supporting functions to ensure that\nthey only consume reasonable cpu cycles.\nIV. VALIDATION OF THE PROPOSED EVALUATION\nFRAMEWORK\nIn this section, we share a real case to demonstrate how\nto use this evaluation framework to identify the performance\nissues and figure out the solutions.\nA. Evaluation Environment\nOur target is to achieve the best Terasort performance on a\n10-node IBM PowerLinux Power7R2 cluster. Table II lists the\ndetailed configurations. Each Power7R2 node has 2 POWER7\nchips at 4.2GHz and 128 GB of memory. Software RAID0 is\nconfigured over LVM to each node.\nThe following sections present our major steps of Terasort\nperformance tuning.\nB. Choose the proper compression algorithm\nIn this part, we demonstrate how to use pattern\n<CSupportingFunction, UCPU/Disk> to select a proper\ncompression/decompression algorithm.\nIt is intuitive to use gzip lib to compress the intermediate\ndata as gzip is well acknowledged for good compression ratio.\nAs shown in the experiment in Figure 4\(a compresses\n1 Tera byte data into 148G. While as indicated by the\nCSupportingFunction, 30% CPU cycles are spend on compres-\nsion. Correlating this with UCPU utilization of CPU, we find\nthat gzip takes significant CPU cycles for each Map and the\nMap task takes much longer time when running together with\nReduce task because of contending for CPU resource. As a\nresult, the average Map task takes 292.4 sec. This motives us\nto seek other compression algorithms with less CPU cost.\n\(a b Algorithm Selection\nFigure 4\(b 


delivers a compression ratio\nof 21.7% while only takes 8% CPU cycles. Each Map task\ncompletes much faster with an average of 74.9 sec which\nsignificantly improves the overall performance.\nIn short, this evaluation pattern CSupportingFunction,\nUCPUDisk> effectively guides us to evaluate the supporting\nfunctions and improve the overall performance from 2120 sec\nto 711 sec.\nC. Spill Once\nIn this part, we show how <NSpillRecord Umemory/heap>\npattern leads us to identify the Spill performance issue.\nFigure 5\(a spill happen and one\nmerge happens at each Map task. The NSpillRecord is 2*1010\nwhile NMapOutputRecord is 1*1010. This suggests that the\noutput buffer of Map task is not large enough to hold all output\nrecords, and hence the Map task spills. If it spills more than\none time, 3 times of I/O operations are needed.\nFrom the resource utilization we can see that the system\nmemory is fully utilized while the java heap only consumes\n434M memory. This clearly suggests us to check runtime\nconfigurations. In total there are three parameters related\nto Map phase spill and merge behavior, that is, io.sort.mb\ndefines the total buffer size io.sort.record.percent defines\nthe proportion between meta-data buffers and key/value data;\nio.sort.spill.percent defines the threshold at which spill is\ntriggered. As shown in the table in Figure 5\(a a b Evaluation\nis 400M. Before performing this evaluation, we are not sure\nhow much heap size will be consumed by the Mapper. Now\nit gives us a confidence that Map task only takes around\n34M. Therefore memory utilization can still be improved by\nassigning more memory to java heap.\nAs a result, by changing the maximum java heap size to\n750M and io.sort.mb to 650M as shown in Figure 5\(b and only\none spill happens. Meanwhile, the overall performance has\nbeen improved from 711 sec to 672 sec by this optimization.\nThis example shows that <NSpillRecord, Umemory/heap>\npattern reveals the potential memory utilization issues includ-\ning java settings and hadoop configurations.\nD. Start the Reduce Phase Early Enough\nIn this part, we show an example of how to use\n<TShuffleTail, Unetwork> to identify the scheduling ineffi-\nciency.\nFigure 6\(a shown in the Unetwork, the\nnetwork is far from fully utilized. The proposed evaluation\nframework helps us identify this problem. The real problem\ncomes from the scheduler. Figure 6\(a Map phase completes, some Reducers even not start\nyet. By more investigation, we find out that the root cause\nis the task scheduler policy. The job tracker only initiates one\nreducer at each heartbeat per node. So for every node, we have\nin total 32 reducers which means that it takes 96 seconds to\ncomplete the initialization. This problem can be solved by\nchanging heartbeat or task scheduler policy.\n\(a 0.4\n\(b b slowstart to 0.1.\nThe TShuffleTail is shortened to 55.2 sec. Although the Map\nphase becomes a little longer because early started reducers\nare contending for CPU resource, the overall performance is\nimproved from 653 sec to 636 sec.\nApparently, the performance optimization is an iterative\nprocess, we continue to use this framework to further identify\nthe new performance issues, and then solve it. Our latest result\nis 471 secs When normalized to GB sorted/node/sec, our\nresult is 0.21 GB/node/sec, while the normalized performance\nof the Terasort world record held by Microsoft Research is\n0.10GB sorted/node/sec [2].\nAll the above performance tuning steps not only benefit\nprogrammers who care about the MapReduce performance,\nbut also provide valuable reference cases to the designers of\ndifferent layers.\nV. RECOMMENDATION FROM THIS FRAMEWORK\nIn this section we summarize our tuning experience by this\nframework as follows. More details could be found at [13].\n1 Efficiently utilizing CPU cycles is important for both\nCPU-bounded and I/O-bounded workloads. For CPU-\nbounded workloads, it is recommended to launch a\nsimilar number of Map/Reduce tasks as the number of\nhardware threads While for I/O-bounded workloads, it\nmight be helpful to spawn a larger number of Map/\nReduce tasks than the number of hardware threads. In\nthis way, when a thread is blocked by I/O operations,\nsome other thread is still able to keep making progress.\n2 Hadoop parameters related to overlapping\nI/O latency with computation. For example, the user can\nget the network I/O of shuffle phase overlapped with Map\ntask computation by tuning Slowstart of Reduce tasks In\naddition, it is possible to change the Hadoop scheduling\npolicy, so that a more suitable scheduler can be selected\nfor specific applications.\n3 This could be achieved by careful tuning\nof JVM heap size, io.sort.mb and io.sort.record.percent.\nWe recommend to firstly utilize all available memory\nresource by setting proper JVM heap size, and then set\nthe fraction of the heap size used for both the intermediate\ndata and the meta data accordingly.\n4 better data locality.\n5 selection of JVM, JIT and GC policy to benefit\nfrom the underlying hardware architecture.\nVI. RELATED WORK\nThe research on MapReduce performance has drawn atten-\ntion for years. Here we briefly summarize the latest 


works\nclosely related to the performance evaluation, performance\nmodeling and optimization methodologies.\nWang et al. evaluated Hadoop performance through a simu-\nlation approach by MRperf [17]. The fundamental scheduling\ncharacteristics of MapReduce was abstracted and modeled\nanalytically in [16]. Ekanayake et al. [5 presented their\nexperiences of applying the MapReduce technique in data\nintensive scientific analysis. Fadika et al. [6] evaluated Hadoop\nperformance in the context of High Performance Computing\nenvironment.\nStarfish [9 took advantage of a comprehensive performance\nmodel to automatically adjust the parameters. Grey-box 11]\nrevealed the hidden relationships between the MapReduce\nperformance and the external observed system features. He\net al. [8] introduced an algorithm that efficiently exploited the\nresource utilization by a probabilistic model.\nFor the related work of performance improvements, LARTS\n[7] was evaluated to be more efficient compared with na-\ntive Hadoop. MSMapper [14] further extended the mapper-\nlevel parallelism and eventually led to better performance.\nCloudRAMSort [12] performed distributed optimization and\nled to sorting one Terabyte data in 4.6 seconds on a 256 node\nx86 cluster.\nVII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we propose a performance evaluation frame-\nwork which helps identify the potential performance issues\nof MapReduce programs. We also share the experiences of\nhow this framework guide us to achieve the best Terasort\nperformance on a 10-node Power7R2 cluster. This framework\nprovides a simple and effective approach which allows users\nat different levels to conduct perform optimization. Moreover,\nit also provides valuable reference to designers of different\nlayers.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Jaql. http://code.google.com/p/jaql/.\n[2] Microsoft researchs minutesort world record. sortbench-\nmark.org/FlatDatacenterStorage2012.pdf.\n[3] Cloudera http://www.cloudera.com/.\n[4] J.

nschedule to meet TRL 6 demonstration by PDR. \nDuring Phase A, a 1/6 prototype of the cooling system was nfabricated and tested, demonstrating thermal and hydraulic \nperformance over mission worst-case hot and cold nenvironments. A full scale radiator was also built and tested \nto demonstrate structural performance. In Phase B, a full \nscale, 1/2 – cooling system is being fabricated that includes \na full-sized solar array platen, two radiators and pump to \ndemonstrate thermal and hydraulic performance of the full \nsystem. An additional solar array wing and radiator are \nbeing fabricated for structural testing. \nDuring Phase A, a solar cell coupon consisting of four solar \ncell assemblies bonded to a water cooled substrate was nsuccessfully tested to the highest predicted steady-state \nirradiance in vacuum. In Phase B, a full-sized secondary \nsection is being fabricated, including a flight-like water-\ncooled platen and flight-like solar cell assemblies. \nTechnology demonstration will include high-temperature, \nhigh-irradiance testing, along with other solar cell \ncharacterization tests that are continuing from Phase A.  \nThe Solar Limb Sensors are an extension of existing \ntechnology, however, the operating environment is different \nfor SPP with the Solar Limb Sensors operating in a \npenumbra environment. In Phase A, the sensor concept and \nfeasibility were developed. Phase B work includes the \nfabrication and testing of a prototype sensor. \nThe FIELDS investigation includes four electric fields \nantennas that extend well beyond the TPS, and so are \nexposed to the full 512 suns at minimum perihelion. Phase \nA development for these antennas centered around extensive \nmaterials testing for candidate antenna materials, and \nniobium has been selected. In Phase B, truncated lengths of \nthe niobium whip antennas are being fabricated and tested in \nhigh illumination conditions. In addition, a prototype of the \nthermal choke used to isolate the antennas from the truss \nstructure assembly will be fabricated and tested. \nThe SWEAP SPC is a Faraday cup with high flight heritage. \nHowever, SPC also extends beyond the TPS and will be \nexposed to the direct solar environment. As with all Faraday \ncups, the instrument is a series of high voltage and ground \ngrids separated by electrical insulators used to measure the \nenergy of incoming solar wind ions. These grids are \nmounted in an enclosure, and behind the grids is a collector nthat interfaces with a rigid coaxial cable to send low-level \nelectrical signals to a preamplifier protected by the TPS.  \nTechnology demonstration for SPC is considerably more \ncomplicated than for the FIELDS antennas Prototype grids \nand insulators have been built and tested to verify electrical \nand thermal performance in the solar encounter \nenvironment. A prototype rigid coaxial cable assembly has \nbeen built and successfully tested. In Phase B, a \ndemonstration prototype of the instrument is being \nfabricated for testing in the simulated solar environment. \n \n6. CONCLUSION \nSolar Probe Plus is the culmination of decades of planning \nfor a mission to the near-Sun environment. The \nmeasurements made by SPP will be critical for our \nunderstanding of the processes by which the Sun produces \nand accelerates the solar wind and energetic particles, and \nhow the Sun’s corona is heated.   \n \nSPP has successfully completed mission definition \nfollowing Phase A. Midway through Phase B, we anticipate \ncontinuing technology demonstration and preliminary \ndesign, with PDR in January 2014. \n \n  9 \n7.

FROM\nTHE BEST \(p < 0.05 comparisons\nbegin to occur with same frequency and hence the advantages\nof ICE become less pronounced.\nFor our synthetic random-walk dataset ICE again generally\nprovided the best performance - but this time the results could\nnot be con?rmed to a statistically signi?cant level, even for\nlarger symbol sets. Note that in general the synthetic data\nprovided an easier task, with almost all methods performing\nbetter than for the real world energy data when quantizing\nto the same number of symbols. A potential explanation is\nthat the nature of the random walk means that the time series\nare more spread out in the space11, and hence it is easier to\ndiscriminate between time series in general. This results in\nless re?ned symbolizations \(with respect to comparisons closing the gap on the ICE quantizer\nas shown in the results. Finally, note that in this dataset the\nsymbol distributions for the time series are Gaussian, and this\nhelps promote the effectiveness of qSax.\nIt is worth also noting that aMSE \(which used the same core\nsimulated annealing algorithm as ICE, varying only the cost\nfunction chosen value of 900 for\nthe approximation of the continuous space in the GPU methods\nwas of an appropriate granularity. A ?nal observation is with\nregard to the poor performance of the MOE and Uniform\nquantizers Their consistent losses, and general inability to\nidentify the majority of nearest neighbours correctly, serve to\nhighlight that the consideration of quantization approach can\nbe vital to the effectiveness of data mining algorithms.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nMany quantization techniques which are thought of as\noptimal, are in fact only optimal within the context of a speci?c\nproblem domain such as signal reconstruction. In this work we\nhave shown that in the extremely prevalent case where quan-\ntized input is used as the basis for time-series comparisons,\nstandard approaches can lead to potential performance loss. To\naddress this issue we have presented a novel quantizer \(ICE computationally tractable implementation\neffective to large data. Our empirical results based upon three\ndifferent datasets \(and using various time-series lengths and\nsymbol-set cardinalities initial evidence for the\nsuperiority of ICE for comparison-based data mining tasks.\nEven though one might expect the assumptions that underpins\nICE to be violated by many real-world datasets, our results\nhave indicated that even when such violations occur our\nquantizer can still provide superior performance to current\nstate-of-the-art quantization approaches.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was funded by the RCUK Horizon Digital\nEconomy Research Hub grant, EP/G065802/1.\n11The variance in the pairwise distances between the original time series\nin the random walk dataset was over double that of the electricity dataset.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
