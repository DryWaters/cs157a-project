to the simple circuit of a synapse between three neuronal cells with non-hebbian learning rules and with temporal associations of condi tioned and unconditioned stimuli This model mimics the synaptic plasticity of the sen sorimotor synapses responsible for the habituation sensitization,classical conditioning of gill-withdrawal reflex The evolution of the neuronal states is described by a set 
of differ ential equations for the dynamics of membrane potential, potassium conductance calcium conductance and calcium concentration in dendritic and assonic regions Introduction Learning behaviour of the marine mollusc Aplysia has been studied extensively and has become a good model for artificial neural networks which take into account interesting aspects of elementary forms of learning such 
as habituation sensitization and classical conditioning Aplysia reacts to a stimulus on its siphon by the defensive response of contracting its gill through a neural circuit which consists of a population of about 25 sensory neurons that innervate the siphon and make monosynaptic connections with interneurons and with gill motoneuron A 
repeated mild stimulus to the siphon causes habituation with a decrease in the response which can last for several hours An unconditioned stimulus as a shock to the tail cause an enhancement of defensive response with a sensitization to even the mild siphon stimulus that has caused the habituation behaviour In the classical conditioning experiments 
the mollusc learns to anticipate an unconditioned shock to its tail following a conditioned All these learning mechanisms can be schematized by the same system of sensory neurons from the siphon that make excitatory monosynaptic connections with motor neurons that control the gill withdrawal see Fig.1 The weight of the senso rimotor synapse is reduced during 
his habituation through a diminished influx of calcium ions into the presynaptic terminal The associative changes produced by conditioning occur through presynaptic facilitation of the synaptic connection This pre-modulatory coincidence mechanism is different from the pre-post coincidence proposed by Hebb5 The group of Card6,7 has developed analog VLSI circuits to mimic qualitatively the learning 2694

the WGS84 Public transformation parameters exist for conversion of coordinates from localized datum to WGS84 lust as it is important to ensure that all data is on the same horizontal datum it is equally important to veiify that all vertical measurements are on the same vertical datum when vertical measurements are important to the knowledge discovery task Use of mean sea level \(MSL\is common but many others can also be found such as low water mean lower low water neap tide or even as height above the ellipsoid to name just a few Most NlMA products express elevation in terms of MSL Global positioning systems give height above the ellipsoid In addition to datum issues working with spatial data in knowledge discovery requires an understanding of the data\222s coordinate reference system Rules for measuring distance for example in one coordinate system may not hold true for another Even more basic is the consideration that all data should be on the same coordinate system in order to simplify spatial analysis The location of spatial data is often expressed with geodetic coordinates of latitude and longitude These are based on an ellipsoid model of the earth Latitude is the angle between the plane of the equator and a line perpendicular to the ellipsoid at a given point Longitude is measured with respect to a prime meridian positive to the east and negative to the west Knowledge discovery in spatial data often involves spatial nearness or distance relationships Geodetic coordinates however are non-Cartesian and require a more coniplicated mathematical calculation great circle path to measure distance 17 Fig 2 shows a screenshot from the GlDB application The map shows NIMA DNC with NAVO bottom sediment data for the Onslow Bay area near the coast of North Carolina The data is shown overlaid on a CADRG a raster map produced by NIMA Any datum and coordinate system incompatibilities are resolved at the time the data are imported into the GIDB database Ll61 Fig 2 GlDB Screenshot Showing NEMA DNC with NAVO Bottom Sediments In addition to geodetic coordinates the location of spatial data may also be expressed in projected coordinates Map projections are common in map making They minimize some distortion while introducing others Some common projections include the Mercator the Transverse Mercator \(TM\Universal Transverse Mercator \(UTM and the Lambert Conformal Conic LCC The Mercator is often used in navigation the TM in quadrangle maps the UTM in large-scale military maps and the LCC in maps with predominantly east-west expanse  171 Some projections may make analysis of spatial relationships easier while other may introduce spatial distortions Those that preserve area may help with analysis of spatial extent while those that preserve scale and direction may help with analysis of nearness Data preparation may involve conversion of all coordinates to a single projection or conversion to geodetic,.according to the needs of the user Fig 3 shows the same area as figure 2 with the additional overlay of gridded and contoured weather data from FNMOC The wind barbs show model output wind data and the contour lines illustrate predicted temperatures The GlDB application allows the user to query these vector features in order to determine wind and temperature attribute values The same holds true for any vector surface Fig 3 GIDB Screenshot Showing the Additional Overlay of Weather Data from FNMOC Much digital spatial data, especially that from NIMA is derived from digitized paper maps Addressing map-scale and especially map-scale differences among such data is also an important step of the data preparation phase of mining spatial data Large-scale such as 1 20,000 spatial data will likely yield more feature-rich detail Small-scale such as 1:2,000,000 data may not Among the questions that need to be answered are whether the data has sufficient detail to yield results Small-scale data may also contain abstract representations of significant features or omit them entirely IS A map of a winding river at one scale may be represented as a nearly straight line at another and completely omitted at yet another Whether the corresponding digital spatial data is an accurate representation of reality or an abstraction may strongly affect the results of the knowledge discovely process Combining data from multiple scales can also impact spatial reasoning operations 1268 


Temporal data present similar issues involving temporal synchronicity and granularity Consider for example temporal atmospheric data consisting of measurements of winds atmospheric pressure rainfall etc each measured by different sensors that record events at various time intervals Some measure each hour some every six minutes some once per day, some once every month etc Depending on the needs of the user data preparation may require some combination of interpolation and binning in order to relate all atmospheric events to precise time intervals B Data Source Issues 1 NIMA data Most vector data distributed by NIMA is in Vector Product Format VPF A VPF database is made up of libraries that aggregate data by scale Libraries are organized into coverages of thematically consistent data that share a single coordinate system and scale and that are contained within a specified spatial extent Coverages can be tiled or geographically subdivided for the purpose of improving data management A tiling scheme defines tile boundaries the size of tiles and the handling of the features that lie on tile boundaries and text primitives that cross boundaries Tiling schemes are defined by product specifications rather than by VPF Coverages are composed of features Five categories of cartographic features are defined in VPF Point Line Area Complex and Text The coordinate system is defined at the library level 6j This data organization generally follows historic mapping techniques of organizing data in disjoint thematic layers While this method is favored for the production of maps in which layers are overlaid to produce the desired map view of the world its usefulness for other purposes can be problematic In particular one study I91 found that this practice resulted in considerable preprocessing and data integration to resolve inconsistencies between layers such as positional errors and to resolve missing attribute and geometric data for purposes of 3D synthetic environment construction For example in some cases in the Digital Nautical Chart feature attributes may be limited to the Digital Geographic Information Exchange Standard\222s DIGEST general feature and attribute coding catalogue FACC codes While this provides an adequate description of what a feature is on a map it fails to give detailed values with respect to this particular feature In some cases attribute values are designated as 221unknown.\222 NIMA\222s Mission Specific Data Sets \(MSDS on the other hand can be a good source of detailed data for a given area with populated attributes Since these are prepared in relation to specific missions they may not exist for a geographic area of interest Of note is the practice of some VPF products to aggregate varying scales within a database\222s library resulting in a scale-range rather than uniform scale within the library For knowledge discovery this means adapting the appropriate knowledge discovery technique to the data  1269 CONCLUSION 2\output This section covers issues relevant to use of gridded model output of the nature of that produced by FNMOC as discussed above This data covers a spatial extent but is highly dependent on the temporal element in that it consists of atmospheric forecasts at short-term periodic intervals originating from the time of the model run Format is CRIB a WMO World Meteorological Organization standard format for archiving and exchanging gridded data It is a binary format that offers some data compression Suitable software is necessary to read the file Because of the data volume of model output little historic output is warehoused necessitating a user-created data store for examining long-term trends or for examining predicted conditions at some time in the past Further, coordinates for the gridded data values are projected in the Mercator projection Care must be taken when merging this data with other spatial data to assure a common coordinate system 3 Observation data This section discusses issues concerning observation data in the context of the data collected at the Argus Site at the FRF mentioned above The discussion should be pertinent to a wide range of sensor-based observation data and serves to highlight areas in which special sensitivities are required in the data prep stage of knowledge discovely As discussed above this data consists of detailed sensor readings over long periods of time Its format is plain text and data for the Argus Site at the FRF is available on the Internet Sensors are periodically replaced and others temporarily malfunction or are turned off for maintenance This effectively produces 223holes\224 in which observations are missing in recorded series In addition sensors record at widely differing intervals ranging from minutes to days or more Of particular note is that the data provided to the public does not always differentiate between actual readings and a time-series summary Hourly reports of wave heights for example may be a summary of the existing conditions over a one-hour time period Further the reported wave height may not have been 223observed\224 but derived from pressure measurements Spatial considerations of datum and projection are relevant here The spatial locations of sensors and physical measurements of sand bar locations etc at the FRF site, for example are reported in a local coordinate system That local system uses cross-shore and along-shore axes to designate x,y coordinates Conversion to latitude and longitude or some other common projection is necessary in order to relate this data to other spatial data We have discussed a variety of data mining or knowledge discovery techniques all having the intent of uncovering useful patterns and associations from large databases We have been working with data mining techniques for a variety of oceanographic data and have 


encountered a number of troublesome issues relative to available data We have described the steps preparatory to data mining and three data mining techniques that we have applied to spatia-temporal data We included a detailed review of various sources of geospatial, oceanographic and meteorological data and associated issues inherent in their use in knowledge discovery We also provided issues relevant to the difficulties in providing an overall integration of this heterogeneous data for knowledge discovery  Generation TEC-0091 US Army Corps of Engineers  161 NIMA 2000 National Imagery and Mapping Agency Technical Report 8350.2, January 3,2000 I71 Snyder J Map Projections A Working Manual U.S Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395 U.S G0VW"nt Printing Office, Washington D.C 1987 I81 USGS Map Scales, Fact Sheet, 015-02 US I91 Trott K Anobis of Digital Topographic Data hues in support of Synthetic Environment Terrain Dofa Base Topographic Engineering Center, November 1996 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank the Naval Research Laboratory's Base Program Program Element No 0602435N for sponsoring this research REFERENCES I Han J and Kamber M Dafa Mining Concepts a,sd Techniques San Diego, CA Academic Press 2000 2 Hand D Mannila H and Smyth P Principles of Data Mining Cambridge, MA MIT Press 2001 3 Ladner R Petry F CobbM Fuzzy Set Approaches to Spatial Data Mining of Association Rules.To appear in Transactions in Geographic Information Systems 2003 4 Burrough P and Frank A eds Geographic Objects with Indeterminate Boundaries GISDATA Series Vol 2 London, UK  Taylor and Francis 1996 Uncertainty in Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Data Fuzzy Sets andSystems 113 1,2000 6 VPF, Departmentment of Defense Interface Standard for Vector Product Format MIL-STD 2407,28 June 7 NIMA Digitizing the Future National Imagery and 8 USAS US Army Simulation Training and 5 Cobb M Petry F and.

higher order interactions In addition we also applied the improved version of the k-means clustering algorithm in CLUTO When using cosine as the similarity measure we were able to identify 36 clean clusters out of 80 clusters which is worse than the hyperclique pattern approach Finally we observed the following effects of the hyperclique-based clustering approach If we set the minimum support threshold to 0 and h-con\223dence threshold to 20 the discovered hyperclique patterns cover 861 items Since there are 932 items in total the hyperclique pattern mining algorithm must have eliminated 71 items We amine the distribution of these 71 items in the CLUTO means clustering results We observe that 68 of the items are assigned to the wrong clusters by CLUTO As a result we believe that the items not covered by these hyperclique patterns are potentially noise items 6 Conclusions In this paper e formalized the problem of mining perclique patterns in data sets with skewed support distribution We also introduced the concept of cross-support property and showed how this property can be used to avoid generating spurious patterns involving items from different support levels Furthermore a ew algorithm called hyperclique miner was eveloped This algorithm utilizes crosssupport and anti-monotone properties of h-con\223dence for the ef\223cient discovery of hyperclique patterns Finally we demonstrated applications of hyperclique patterns for discovering strong af\223nity patterns among low-support items and for hyperclique-based item clustering For future work there is a potential for using the hyperclique concept in a variety of applications such as dimensionality reduction copy detection and collaborative 223ltering Also it is valuable to exploit the 000\001

Issues While it w as in tellectually c hallenging to dev elop a declarativ e expression for asso ciation rule mining from deductiv e databases there are sev eral op en issues with great promises for

These are some of the issues w e plan to address in the near future The motiv ation imp ortance and the need for in tegrating data mining tec hnology with relational databases has b een addressed in sev eral articles suc h as 12  13 They con vincingly argue that without suc h in tegration data mining tec hnology ma y not nd itself in a viable p osition in the y ears to come T o b e a successful
