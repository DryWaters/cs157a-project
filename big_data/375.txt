To rank the performance of estimators, a\npopular method is using the same error metric of performance. It\nis not without controversy. First, this ranking method depending\non the “marginal” information without considering the “joint”\ninformation among the estimators is one-sided since different\nerror metrics reflect different aspects of performance. Second,\nranking according to different error metrics may lead to different\nresults. Thus, we propose to use the “joint” information just like\nPitman’s closeness measure \(PCM to rank the performance of es-\ntimators. However, one drawback of PCM, named nontransitivity,\nbrings big trouble for estimation performance ranking. To rank\nestimators utilizing the “joint” information, we propose a new\napproach using a so-called estimator ranking vector \(ERV corresponding estimators\nare. Order-preserving mappings are proposed to obtain ERV,\nwhich, however, may not be unique. Then we use three specific\nmappings \(i.e., linear, contraction, and concave, respectively this problem. Linear mappings can be easily applied and\nthe other two mappings broaden the application domain of ERV.\nThe ranking vector can also be used in multiple-attribute ranking\nproblem. It does not need data normalization.\nKeywords—Performance ranking, estimation, ranking vector,\nmapping.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEstimation performance evaluation has received significant\nattention in recent years. There are many metrics for tracking\n\(see, e.g., [1]–[9 see, e.g., [10]–[12 incomprehensive and\ncomprehensive ones, enrich the theoretical work on measures\nfor estimation performance evaluation \(see, e.g., [13]–[20 multiple estimators, how to rank their performance\nbased on single or multiple performance metrics is a worth-\nwhile problem.\nGiven multiple estimators, most people may select root-\nmean-square error \(RMSE is the most popular error\nmetric for estimation performance evaluation, to determine\ntheir ranking. However RMSE has two serious flaws, as\nResearch supported in part by grant for State Key Program for Basic\nResearch of China \(973 2013CB329405 61203120 NASA/LEQSF\(2013-15 the\nResearch Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China\n\(20110201120007 Research Funds for the Central\nUniversities of China.\npointed out in [15]. First, it pays too much attention on\nhow bad the performance is, that is, it is highly large-error\ndominant. Second, RMSE has no clear physical interpretation.\nSome people may select another measure of performance,\nsuch as average Euclidean error \(AEE geometric average\nerror \(GAE HAE  mid-range error \(IMRE  is not without controversy. First, this method\ndepends on the “marginal” information without considering the\n“joint” information among the estimators. Here, “marginal”\ninformation means the information of each estimator and\n“joint” information is the relative information of the multiple\nestimators. Thus, this method is one-sided since different error\nmetrics reflect different aspects of performance. Second, rank-\ning according to different error metrics may not be consistent,\nthat is, different error metrics may lead to different ranking\nresults. For instance, there are three estimators xˆ1, xˆ2 and xˆ3.\nAccording to RMSE, xˆ1 is better than xˆ2 and xˆ2 better than\nxˆ3. However, according to AEE, xˆ1 may be better than xˆ3 and\nxˆ3 better than xˆ2. Thus, ranking results are not consistent. Is\nthere any other approach?\nAs mentioned above, ranking based on the same measure\nof performance depends on the “marginal” information. If we\nlet them compete with each other, then the “joint” information\ncan be used. For comparing the performance of rival estimators\nof a parameter, Pitman [21] proposed a criterion based on the\nprobability that one estimator is closer to the parameter than\nthe other. If this probability exceeds 0.5 for each value of\nthe parameter, then the first estimator can be considered to be\nsuperior to the second [22]. This criterion is known as Pitman’s\ncloseness criterion or Pitman’s closeness measure \(PCM on\nPCM allows us to quantify “how probable” we have chosen\nthe better one. Thus the simple philosophy of PCM can also\nbe found in a discourse by Descartes: “...when it is not in our\npower to discern the truest opinion we ought to follow the\nmore probable.” [23]\nRao observed some peculiar phenomena about PCM [24].\nHe successfully argued for PCM as an intrinsic measure of\nacceptability and presented many diverse examples in which\nshrinking the MSE of an unbiased estimator to an MMSE\nestimator does not yield a better estimator in the sense of PCM\n[20], [24]. [25] discussed ways of determining the relevant\nprobabilities for Pitman’s closeness 


comparison of estimators\n453\n16th International Conference on Information Fusion \nIstanbul, Turkey, July 9-12 2013 \n978-605-86311-1-3 ©2013 ISIF\n[22], [24]. The main advantages of PCM were described in\n[20] as follows First, it uses the “joint” information of two\ncompeting estimators, and more information can be extracted.\nSecond, PCM is generally applicable and robust against the\nchoice of the error metric.\nHowever, PCM is not perfect. It has some drawbacks,\nas described in [24]. A basic problem is that in giving the\npreference to an estimator, it may take into account a subset\nof the sample space that occurs only with a probability slightly\ngreater than 0.5; the “winner” can then be arbitrarily bad when\nthe observation does not belong to this subset. Due to this\npeculiarity, it is not transitive. For example, if xˆ1 is better than\nxˆ2 and xˆ2 better than xˆ3, then by PCM, xˆ1 is not necessarily\nbetter than xˆ3. Nontransitivity of PCM is the most severe\nproblem for estimation performance ranking.\nTo solve this basic problem, [20] proposed a relative loss\nmeasure and a relative gain measure. They can greatly alleviate\nthe peculiarity of PCM that “the winner can be arbitrarily\nbad when the observation does not belong to the particular\nsubset”. However, they are still not always transitive. To solve\nthe problem of nontransitivity, [26] defined a Bayesian version\nof Pitman’s closeness called posterior Pitman closeness. It was\nproved that this closeness is transitive in one dimension under\nfairly modest assumptions, and that the posterior median is\nthe posterior Pitman closest estimator However, in general,\ntransitivity is still a big problem for ranking.\nTo solve the nontransitivity problem of PCM and use the\n“joint” information, we define a PCM matrix which contains\nthe entire pairwise competition results of all estimators based\non PCM. The PCM matrix can be used to rank estimators.\nIn this paper, by using the PCM matrix, we present two\nmethods named simple score addition \(SSA LSA respectively. For each estimator, SSA is the\nsum of PCM results by competing with the other estimators\none by one. LSA can be viewed as a limiting form of SSA by\nrepeating the competition infinitely many times.\nIn this paper, for ranking estimation performance, we\npropose a new approach by using an estimator ranking vector\n\(ERV the magnitudes of\nthese elements represent a rank. For example, given three\nestimators xˆ1, xˆ2, and xˆ3 with ERV [1, 1.5, 2.5]?, the rank is:\nxˆ3, xˆ2, xˆ1. According to the ERV, all estimators involved are\nranked directly and no need to consider the problem of non-\ntransitivity. However, we do not have the ERV from the very\nbeginning and what we have is the competition results. Then\nhow can we obtain ERV? The basic idea is as follows. The\ncompetition process can be viewed as a mapping and the result\nshould reflect the relative strengths of the estimators. Thus, it\nis reasonable to require that mapping be order-preserved. For\nexample if the ERV is [1, 1.5, 2.5]? and the mapping result\nis [2, 3, 4]?, then this mapping is order-preserved. If the ERV\nis [1, 1.5, 2.5]? and the mapping result is [2, 1, 4]?, then the\nmapping is not order-preserved However, the obtained ERV\nby order-preserving mapping may not be unique. For example,\nif for one ERV [1, 1.5 2.5]? the mapping result is [2, 3, 4]?\nand for another ERV [2, 1.5, 2.5]? the corresponding mapping\nresult is 3.5, 3, 4]?, then how should we choose? We use three\nspecific mappings called linear mapping, contraction mapping,\nand concave mapping to solve this problem. Linear mapping\ncan be easily applied and the other two mappings broaden the\napplication domain of ERV. In short, our goal is to obtain a\nunique ERV according to joint” information of the estimators.\nThus, we still let the estimators compete with each other, that\nis, PCM or some other competition process is one step of our\nmethod.\nThe above proposed ranking methods are based on a single\nperformance metric such as PCM by using “joint” information.\nIn practice, sometimes we want to rank estimation performance\nbased on multiple performance metrics such as RMSE, AEE,\nGAE, HAE, median error, error mode, IMRE, and so on.\nActually, this is a multiple-attribute ranking problem. Multiple\nmethods of comprehensive evaluation can be used to solve this\nproblem \(see, e.g., [27]–[31 based\non weighted average, that is, they convert multiple attributes\ninto one attribute for ranking. Weighted average is not without\ncontroversy. First, data should be normalized prior to weighted\naveraging because different attributes may have different units\nand orders of magnitude. However, we do not have a perfect\ndata normalization method and different methods of data\nnormalization may lead to different ranking results Moreover,\nimproper data normalization may lead to bad results. Thus,\ndata normalization is a big problem for methods of weighted\naverage. Second, methods using a weighted average can also be\nviewed as a “marginal information user without considering\nthe “joint” information among the compared objects. There-\nfore, the existing ranking methods based on weighted average\nare not appropriate for us to apply in ranking estimation\nperformance based on multiple performance metrics.\nFor ranking estimation performance based on multiple per-\nformance metrics, we also propose to use the ranking vectors.\nJust like the definition of PCM we define multiple-attribute\ncompetition measure \(MCM the “joint” information, we define an\nMCM matrix, which contains the entire pairwise competition\nresults of 


all compared objects based on MCM. Then, all the\nabove proposed methods can be used for ranking estimation\nperformance based on multiple performance metrics. There are\ntwo advantages. First, the problem of data normalization is\nnaturally avoided since we just need to make comparison for\nthe same attribute. Second the problem of nontransitivity is\navoided and “joint” information is extracted. Furthermore, in\npractice different performance metrics need not have equal\n“weight”, that is, we can give them different “weights based\non their importance in practice. For example, if RMSE is more\nimportant, then we can count it more times.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the\nPCM matrix. Simple score addition and limit score addition\nare also presented for solving the nontransitivity problem of\nPCM. In Section III order-preserving mappings are presented\nand linear, contraction, and concave mappings for obtaining a\nunique ERV are proposed. In Section IV, the MCM and MCM\nmatrix are defined. We also propose to use the ranking vector\nto solve the multiple-attribute ranking problem. In Section\nV, a simple example is provided to illustrate the difference\nbetween PCM and ERV when transitivity of PCM does hold\nin some scenarios. The other example illustrates how to use\nthe ranking vector to rank estimation performance based on\nmultiple performance metrics. Section VI concludes this paper.\n454\nII. PCM MATRIX, SIMPLE SCORE ADDITION AND LIMIT\nSCORE ADDITION\nA. PCM Matrix\nPCM is based on the probability of the relative closeness\nof competing estimators to the estimand [20]. The following\ndefinition of PCM was given in [20]. For convenience, we\nquote it here. Given a probabilistic model p \(x, z observation z alone. Let m \(1, 2;x relative to\nthe parameter x, and\nm \(1, 2;x xˆ2 means that xˆ1 is prefered to xˆ2 relative to\nthe parameter x, for example, ?xˆ1 ? x? < ?xˆ2 ? x? for some\nvector norm ?·?. PCM for measuring xˆ1 ? xˆ2 relative to x is\ndefined as\nM \(1, 2;x m \(1, 2;x xˆ1 ? xˆ2 xˆ1 = xˆ2  1, 2;x Pitman-closer to x than xˆ2 is. We have the\nfollowing relation\nM \(1, 2;x 2, 1;x Introduction, one of the drawbacks of\nPCM is nontransitivity. To use the “joint” information, we\ndefine the PCM matrix as\nXPCM ,\n??? M \(1, 1;x 1, N ;x N, 1;x N,N ;x 1 PCM matrix contains the entire pairwise competition\nresults of all estimators based on PCM. Pairwise competition\nmakes good use of the “joint” or relative information.\nB. Simple Score Addition\nNow, the above PCM matrix can be used to determine the\nranking of the estimators. One simple method is simple score\naddition SSA  2 when\ncompeting with the other estimators one by one. Thus, a larger\nelement of SSA means that the corresponding estimator is\nbetter than the estimator that corresponds to a smaller element\nof SSA.\nThe following example illustrates how SSA is calculated.\nExample 1. Assume we have the following PCM matrix\nXPCM n[\n0.5 0.8 0.7\n0.2 0.5 0.7\n0.3 0.3 0.5\n]\nAccording to \(2  n1\n1\n1\n]\n= [ 2.0 1.4 1.1 ]\n?\nBy SSA we conclude that xˆ1 is better than xˆ2 and xˆ2 better\nthan xˆ3.\nHowever SSA sometimes does not reflect the strength\nof the estimators because of the following drawbacks Here,\nstrength reflects how good the performance is. First, SSA\nignores the prior strength \(i.e., all equal to 1 the information of PCM matrix is\nnot completely explored. For example, if we treat the result of\nSSA as the prior strength and calculate another SSA, then the\nranking result may change.\nThe following example illustrates this problem.\nExample 2. Assume we have the following PCM matrix\nXPCM =\n[\n0.5 0.6 0.7\n0.4 0.5 0.9\n0.3 0.1 0.5\n]\nAccording to \(2  is better.\nTo solve the above problem, we define simple score addi-\ntion square \(SSA2 1]\n? \(3 3 0.5\n]2 [\n1\n1\n1\n]\n=\n[\n0.5 0.6 0.7\n0.4 0.5 0.9\n0.3 0.1 0.5\n]\n[ 1.8 1.8 0.9 ]\n?\n= [ 2.61 2.43 1.17 ]\n?\nBy SSA2 we conclude that xˆ1 is better than xˆ2. For this\nexample, SSA2 can distinguish which one is better while SSA\ncan not because SSA2 takes advantage of information about the\nprior strength of the estimators. This prior strength is obtained\nby the first step \(i.e., the SSA information of the PCM matrix. In\nother words, compared with SSA, SSA2 makes better use of\nthe “joint information. Thus, SSA2 can make a better ranking\nthan SSA.\nC. Limit Score Addition\nSince SSA2 makes better use of the “joint” information and\ncan explore more information of the PCM matrix, a natural\nidea is to repeat the competition results more times, that is,\nto multiply the PCM matrix more times. The extreme case is\n455\nto let the number of repetition go to infinity. Thus, limit score\naddition \(LSA lim\nn??\nXnPCM [1, . . . , 1]\n???XnPCM [1, . . . , 1]??? \(4 matrix and\n[32] illustrated that a positive matrix had that limit.\nCompared with SSA and SSA2, LSA explores 


much more\ninformation of the PCM matrix and makes much better use of\nthe “joint” information.\nIII. ERV AND ORDER-PRESERVING MAPPING\nA. ERV and Order-Preserving Mapping\nAs mentioned in Introduction, based on “joint infor-\nmation, transitivity does not hold in general. For ranking\nestimation performance using “joint information, we define\nERV as\nr = [r1, . . . , rN ]\n?\nwhere N is the number of estimators and ri > 0 \(i = 1 N other. As mentioned\nin the previous section, the strength reflects how good the\nperformance is. The larger the element is, the better the\ncorresponding estimator is. Then how can we obtain ERV?\nA competition process can be viewed as a mapping ? =\nF mapping, i.e., ? = XPCM?. Here, it is reason-\nable to require that F be an order-preserving mapping since the\ncompetition process should not change the relative strengths of\nestimators and competition results should show the strengths.\nHere, order-preserving mapping means the order/ranking of\nthe elements of ? and that of are the same. Then r can be\nobtained according to this requirement. However, r may not\nbe unique in general To obtain a unique ERV, we consider\nseveral specific cases.\nB. Linear Mapping\nAssume we have an ERV r and competition matrix X \(e.g.,\nthe PCM matrix XiNrN\nThus, the final scores of the estimators can be written as\ny = Xr\nwhere y = [y1, . . . yN ]? is the final score vector. Here, we\nassume that the final scores are proportional to the strengths\nof the estimators i.e., ERV r that is,\nF \(r r have\nXr = ?r \(5 33] shows that\nthere exists an eigenvector r with all positive entries and its\ncorresponding eigenvalue is positive and the largest eigenvalue\n\(in absolute value scalar multiple ?r of r with a positive ? is also an\neigenvector with the same eigenvalue. Actually, the ranking is\nunique because all positive eigenvectors are proportionable.\nPerron-Frobenius Theorem \(positive matrix i.e., each element of A is a positive number A A spectral radius of A, then the\nfollowing statements are true [33].\n• ? > 0\n• ? is called the Perron root.\n is the only eigenvalue on the spectral circle of A.\n• There exists an eigenvector r > 0 such that Ar = ?r.\n There are no other nonnegative eigenvectors except\none that has all positive elements, that is, all other\neigenvectors must have at least one negative or non-\nreal element.\nAccording to the Perron-Frobenius theorem, if we have a\npositive matrix X \(e.g., PCM matrix in X , they can be replaced by very\nsmall positive numbers.\nIn fact, to calculate the positive eigenvector or ERV, we\ncan use the following limitation method [32]\nr = lim\nn??\nXnr0\n?Xnr0?\n\(6 vector. Compared with LSA \(4 1]\n?\n. Actually, when X = XPCM, r = LSA. Thus,\nthis method can be viewed as a steady-state result by an infinite\nnumber of identical competitions presented by matrix X .\nExample 3. Assume we have the following PCM matrix\nXPCM =\n[\n0.5 0.6 0.6\n0.4 0.5 0.84\n0.4 0.16 0.5\n]\nAccording to \(2 0.16 0.5\n][\n1\n1\n1\n]\n= [ 1.7 1.74 1.06 ]\n?\nAccording to \(3 0.16 0.5\n] [\n1.7\n1.74\n1.06\n]\n= [ 2.43 2.44 1.49 ]\n?\n456\nThe ERV \(i.e., a positive eigenvector of XPCM 0.6625 0.6376 0.3931 ]\n?\nSSA shows that xˆ2 is better than xˆ1 and xˆ1 better than\nxˆ3. Although SSA2 has the same ranking result as SSA, the\nspecific results of xˆ2 and xˆ1 are very close. By ERV, we\nconclude that xˆ1 is better than xˆ2 and xˆ2 better than xˆ3. ERV,\nas a steady-state result, explores much more information of\nthe PCM matrix and makes much better use of the “joint”\ninformation. Thus, we trust ERV more.\nC Contraction Mapping\nThe above linear mapping is one approach to obtaining\nERV. For a more general \(nonlinear mapping, can we still\nobtain a unique ERV? Fortunately, this question is answered\nby the following theorem 34].\nBanach Fixed Point Theorem. Let \(Z, d Z ? Z .\nThen F admits a unique fixed point r in Z \(i.e., F \(r start with an arbitrary\nelement r0 in Z and define a sequence {Zn} by\nZn = F \(Zn?1 7 F is a contraction mapping, defined as follows [35].\nLet \(Z, d a\ncontraction mapping on Z , if there exists q ? [0, 1 F \(x y x, y in Z . A contraction mapping can be a linear\nor nonlinear mapping. The Banach fixed point theorem 34]\nguarantees the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point of\ncertain self maps of metric spaces and provides a constructive\nmethod to find that fixed point.\nAccording to the Banach fixed point theorem, we can\nobtain a unique fixed point r, that is, the unique ERV.\nReal world illustrations [34]. The Banach fixed point\ntheorem has the following interesting real world illustrations\nthat can help us understand it well. When you go into a\nshopping mall, somewhere, usually you can see a map of the\nmall. On the map, there is a cross or 


arrow indicating your\nlocation with the text “You are here”. This point on the map\ncoincides with the corresponding point in the shopping mall.\nIt can be explained as follows. Drawing shopping mall onto\nthe map can be view as a contraction mapping and that point\nis a fixed point. According to the Banach fixed point theorem,\nthat unique fixed point exists.\nConsider another real world illustration [34]. Take two\nsheets of graph paper of equal size with coordinate systems\non them, and then lay one flat on the table and crumple up\n\(without ripping or tearing crumpled paper does not\nreach out of the flat one. Then there will be at least one point of\nthe crumpled sheet that lies exactly on top of its corresponding\npoint \(i.e., the point with the same coordinates sheet.\nThis point is a fixed point; however, it has nothing to do with\nthe Banach fixed point theorem since that process can not be\nviewed as a contraction mapping. Moreover, the fix point is not\nunique. In fact, this real world illustration is related to another\nfixed point theorem named the Brouwer fixed point theorem\n[34].\nBrouwer Fixed Point Theorem. Assume that K is a\ncompact convex subset of Rn and that F : K ? K is a\ncontinuous mapping. Then F has a fixed point in K .\nThe Brouwer fixed point theorem does not follow from\nthe Banach fixed point theorem and the fixed point is not\nnecessarily unique. The second real world illustration above\nis a consequence of the n = 2 case of the Brouwer fixed point\ntheorem.\nFurthermore, the Perron-Frobenius theorem \(for a positive\nmatrix theorem [36] if let K denote the set{\n\(x1, . . . , xn x for x ? K .\nAlthough the Brouwer fixed point theorem is well known\nbecause of its use across numerous fields of mathematics, it\ncan not be used to obtain ERV directly since the fixed point\nis not unique sometimes.\nD Concave Mapping\nContraction mappings contain some nonlinear mappings.\nThis subsection focuses on concave mapping, which also con-\ntains some nonlinear mappings. A concave mapping is defined\nas follows [37]. Let Rn be the n-dimensional Euclidean space\nwith a standard cone\nK = Rn+ = {x ? R\nn| x = \(x1, . . . , xn for 1 ? i ? n}\nA mapping T : K ? K is concave if\nT \(?x + \(1 1 0, 1]. A unique ERV can be\nobtained according to the following concave Perron-Frobenius\ntheorem.\nConcave Perron-Frobenius Theorem [37]. For a concave\nmapping T : K ? K with Tx > 0 for x > 0 the following\nstatements hold.\n• The conditional eigenvalue problem Tx = ?x with\n? ? R, x ? K , ?x? = 1 has a unique solution x = x?,\n and x? > 0, ?? > 0.\n• For the normalized mapping T˜ x = Tx?Tx? , x > 0,\nlim\nk??\nT˜ kx = x? for all x 0.\nIn this section, we proposed to rank the performance of\nestimators by ERV. The “joint” information of estimators are\nused and the problem of nontransitivity is avoided. Linear map-\npings can be applied easily and directly and the unique positive\nERV \(eigenvector conveniently. Contraction mappings and concave\nmappings are more complicated than linear mappings, but they\nbroaden the application domain of ERV.\n457\nIV. RANKING BASED ON RANKING VECTOR\nMultiple-attribute ranking is very popular and plays an\nimportant role in economy, society, etc. Multiple methods of\ncomprehensive evaluation can be used to solve this problem,\nsuch as fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, principal component\nanalysis, linear weighted composite method, and so on \(see,\ne.g., [27]–[31 on a weighted average.\nThe weighted average methods differ in how to determine the\nweights. They can be grouped into three classes: subjective\nweighted, objective weighted, and a combination of the two.\nJust like RMSE, however, they solve the multiple-attribute\nranking problem based on the “marginal” information More-\nover, data normalization is a big problem and sometimes it is\nthe most difficult part. Thus, we propose to use our ranking\nvector to rank the performance. As mentioned, the ranking\nvector uses “joint” information and does not need to normalize\ndata. Therefore additional information can be extracted.\nA. Multiple-Attribute Competition Measure Matrix\nJust like PCM, for multiple-attribute ranking problems, we\ncan define a multiple-attribute competition measure \(MCM 1, 2; a the\ndifference between two compared objects S1 and S2 relative to\nthe ith attribute ai \(the total number of the competitions w.r.t.\nai is n 1, 2; ai S2\n0 if S2 is better than S1\nThen, the MCM is defined as\nMMCM \(1, 2; a 1, 2; ai is the vector of the attributes. When MMCM \(1, 2; a have the\nfollowing relation\nMMCM \(1, 2; a 2, 1; a joint”\ninformation, we define the MCM matrix as\nXMCM ,\n??? MMCM \(1, 1; a 1, N a N, 1; a N,N ; a MCM matrix contains the entire pairwise competition\nresults of all compared objects based on MCM. Pairwise com-\npetition makes good use of the “joint” or relative information.\nThe following example demonstrates how the ranking\nvector can be used for multiple-attribute ranking.\nExample 4. There are four students and ten attributes in\nTable I. Our goal is to rank the comprehensive quality of the\nfour students. Let the students 


compete with each other just\nlike Pitman’s closeness measure does. For example, S1 is better\nthan S2 for math and arts, but S2 is better than S1 for the\nother eight attributes. Thus, X12 = MMCM \(1, 2; a I. TEN ATTRIBUTES OF FOUR STUDENTS\nS1 S2 S3 S4\nmath 90 86 88 80\narts 95 93 90 86\nlong jump 4.1m 4.5m 5.0m 5.2m\nEnglish 86 88 90 92\ngeography 87 91 90 86\nphysics 88 95 90 83\nmusic 87 95 88 92\nhigh jump 1.5m 1.53m 1.6m 1.6m\nhistory 90 92 95 85\nshot put 6.6m 6.7m 6.8m 6.9m\nX21 = MMCM \(2, 1; a the\nfollowing MCM matrix is obtained:\nXMCM =\n??? 0.5 0.2 0.2 0.50.8 0.5 0.4 0.60.8 0.6 0.5 0.55\n0.5 0.4 0.45 0.5\n???\nThen according to the Perron-Frobenius theorem, we can\nobtain a positive ranking vector as\nr 0.3294 0.5558 0.6042 0.4664 ]\n?\nThus, the rank is: S3, S2, S4, S1.\nMoreover, our method is more proper for the case of an\nadequate number of attributes because the “joint” information\nis not adequate if there are not enough attributes, then. In\nthis case, “marginal” information should play an important\nrole. Therefore, for multiple-attribute ranking, we need to\nconsider the practical case more specifically. Anyway, using\nthe ranking vector does have the following advantages. First,\n“joint” information is used, that is, additional information is\nextracted. Second, no need to consider the severe problem\nof data normalization. Third, the unique positive ranking\nvector can be calculated easily. Fourth, the thorny problem\nof nontransitivity is avoided.\nB. Ranking Estimation Performance Based on Multiple Per-\nformance Metrics\nFor estimation performance evaluation, sometimes we want\nto rank the performance of estimators according to RMSE,\nAEE, GAE, HAE, IMRE median error, error mode and some\nother errors. Here, just like what we did in Example 4, the\nranking vector provides an option. The following example\nillustrates how to use ranking vector to rank estimation per-\nformance based on multiple performance metrics.\nExample 5. Assume we have four estimators xˆ1, xˆ2,\nxˆ3 and xˆ4. The estimation errors x˜1, x˜2, x˜3 and x˜4 are\ngenerated from the following distributions x˜1 ? N 0.8, 1 0.5, 1 4, 1 0.6, 1 2.5, 1 0.1 1 14, 1 a, b estimator, 10000 errors are generated to\ncalculate RMSE, AEE, GAE, HAE, median error, error mode\nand IMRE. The results are in Table II. Let the estimators\ncompete with each other just like example 4 does. For example,\nxˆ2 is better than xˆ1 for HAE and median error, but xˆ1 is better\nthan xˆ2 for the other five performance metrics. Thus, X12 =\n458\nMMCM \(1, 2; a 2, 1; a following MCM matrix is obtained:\nXMCM =\n??? 0.5 0.7143 0.5714 0.28570.2857 0.5 0.1429 0.14290.4286 0.8571 0.5 0.2857\n0.7143 0.8571 0.7143 0.5\n???\nThen according to the Perron-Frobenius theorem, we can\nobtain a positive ranking vector as\nr = [ 0.4927 0.2374 0.4731 0.6907 ]\n?\nThus, we conclude that the rank is: xˆ4, xˆ1, xˆ3 xˆ2. This\nexample shows that the ranking vector can be applied easily\nfor ranking estimation performance based on multiple perfor-\nmance metrics. It uses “joint” information and does not need\ndata normalization.\nTABLE II RESULTS OF PERFORMANCE METRICS\nxˆ1 xˆ2 xˆ3 xˆ4\nRMSE 1.2863 1.6928 1.3759 2.2860\nAEE 1.0454 1.2126 1.0788 1.1614\nGAE 0.7152 0.7246 0.7063 0.6280\nHAE 0.1949 0.1656 0.1206 0.1083\nmedian error 0.9102 0.8633 0.8855 0.7831\nerror mode 0.0214 0.0311 0.0268 0.0093\nIMRE 1.0095 1.0838 1.0220 0.9381\nV. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES\nWe treat the performance metrics impartially in the above\nexample, that is, the performance metrics have equal weight.”\nIn fact, different metrics need not have an equal “weight.” We\ncan give them different “weights based on their importance\nin practice. For example, if RMSE is deemed more important,\nthen we can count RMSE more times. We illustrate it by the\nfollowing example.\nExample 6. Assume we have four estimators xˆ1, xˆ2 xˆ3\nand xˆ4 that are exactly the same as in Example 5. Here,\nwe assume that RMSE is more important than the other\nperformance metrics such that we count it 2.9 times. Let\nthe estimators compete with each other. For example, xˆ2 is\nbetter than xˆ1 for HAE and median error, but xˆ1 is better\nthan xˆ2 for the other 6.9 performance metrics \(RMSE is\ncounted 2.9 times 1, 2; a 2, 1; a 2/8.9. By pairwise competition,\nthe following MCM matrix is obtained:\nX =\n??? 0.5 0.7753 0.6629 0.43820.2247 0.5 0.1124 0.32580.3371 0.8876 0.5 0.4382\n0.5618 0.6742 0.5618 0.5\n???\nThen according to the Perron-Frobenius theorem, we can\nobtain a positive ranking vector as\nr = [ 0.5814 0.2733 0.5035 0.5777 ]\n?\nThus, we can conclude that the rank is: xˆ1, xˆ4, xˆ3, xˆ2.\nComparing Example 5 with Example 6, we can see that the\nranking results are different. In practice, different error metrics\nneed not have the same “weight.” We can give them different\n“weights” based on their importance.\nIf the transitivity of PCM does hold in some scenarios,\nthen can we declare that ranking based on PCM is the same\nas ranking based on ERV? We answer this question by the\nfollowing example.\nExample 7. Assume we have three estimators xˆ1, xˆ2, and\nxˆ3, and the PCM matrix is\nXPCM =\n[\n0.5 0.7 0.8\n0.3 0.5 0.9\n0.2 0.1 0.5\n]\nThen, we have ERV \(i.e., a positive eigenvector 0.7691 0.5821 0.2637 ]?\nFrom XPCM we can see that transitivity does hold. The ranking\nresult based on PCM can be concluded as follows. xˆ1 is the\nbest and xˆ2 is better than xˆ3. This is the same as the ranking\nresult of ERV.\nIf the PCM matrix is\nXPCM =\n[\n0.5 0.51 0.51\n0.49 0.5 0.9\n0.49 0.1 0.5\n]\nthen we have ERV\nr = [ 0.5996 


0.6977 0.3922 ]?\nFrom the PCM matrix we can conclude that xˆ1 is the best\nand xˆ2 is better than xˆ3. However ERV shows that xˆ2 is the\nbest and xˆ1 is better than xˆ3. Thus, ranking based on PCM\nand that based on ERV are inconsistent. In our opinion, the\nreason is the following. PCM cares only better or worse, and\nnot how much better or worse. That is, 0.51 and 0.99 is the\nsame when PCM is directly used for ranking. On the contrary,\nERV does evaluate how much better or worse to some extent.\nThus, they may be inconsistent sometimes In other words,\nERV uses more information than PCM although both of them\nuse “joint” information. Thus, we should trust ERV more.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper deals with estimation performance ranking\nusing “joint information. PCM, as a “joint” information user,\nhas some drawbacks. One of its drawbacks named nontransi-\ntivity is a big problem for estimation performance ranking. We\nhave presented simple score addition and limit score addition\nby using the PCM matrix. To rank estimators with “joint”\ninformation, we have proposed a new approach by using the\nso-called estimator ranking vector. Order-preserving mappings\nhave been proposed to obtain ERV. However, the obtained ERV\nmay not be unique. Then three specific mappings, named linear\nmapping, contraction mapping and concave mapping, have\nbeen proposed to obtain a unique ERV. Among these three\nmappings, linear mapping can be applied easily; contraction\nmapping and concave mapping broaden the application domain\nof ERV. These two mappings deserve more studies. For the\nproblem of multiple-attribute ranking, just like PCM and the\nPCM matrix, we have defined MCM and MCM matrix. The\nranking vector can also be applied to this problem. It uses the\n“joint” information and the troublesome data normalization is\navoided Seven examples have been presented to illustrate the\nfollowing conclusions. SSA2 can make a better ranking than\nSSA. Compared with SSA and SSA2, LSA explores much\n459\nmore information of the PCM matrix and makes better use\nof the “joint” information. Different error metrics need not\nhave the same “weight” in practice when multiple performance\nmetrics are used for ranking estimation performance. ERV uses\nmore information than PCM, although both of them use “joint”\ninformation.\nREFERENCES\n[1] E. Blasch and P.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
