This new approach belongs to the Direct Group Mobility \(DGM\ prediction scheme and 
is based on the Tree Path Construction Algorithm TPCON\ and the Merge Tree Algorithm \(MTA\. Two Call Admission Control \(CAC\ algorithms are developed for each BS according to the predictive or adaptive policy for the reservation operation in order to minimize the call dropping probability. This study deals with the system behavior only at exceptional congestion time periods \(periodical events 1. Introduction Many strategies have been  developed  that ensure handoff connections are given priority over new call attempts such as: the queuing of handoff reques 
and the channel reservation schemes h e availability of the wireless network resources cannot be guaranteed throughout the lifetime of a connection In th e m obile ter m i n a l  w i t h a data stru ctu re  mechanism  predicts the next moves.  The quality of service \(QoS\ cellular networks is mainly determined by two blocking probabilities the Call blocking probability \(cbp\,when a new connection request is not granted permission to enter the network and the 
Call dropping probability \(cdp when a connection is violently ended during a handoff between cells \(lack of resources\e examine the group mobility patterns of a userês routes \(going to work, schools etc\ daily basis for a long time period week\n order to discover periodical events \(like basketball game\xceptional congestion time periods.  During, before, or after  the events many mobile users ask for bandwidth  all at the same  time which might cause dropping of the internal calls. In this case a collaborative system 
between the wired and wireless part of the network is developed. Data Mining 4  w i th th e t e r m s o f it em s e ts  a s s o c i a t i o n r u l e s   support and confidence provides us with the necessary tools to elaborate this problem 2. Model Description 2.1.  Wireless network structure In our model of  the classical wireless/mobile network with a cellular infrastructure we consider a wired backbone and a number of base stations \(BSs 2.2. Data Mining concepts Let I = { i 1 i 
2 i 3 i m be a set of literals called items. An itemset  containing k  items is called an kitemset.    A transaction T \(or itemset\f items such that T  I.   Let X be a set of items . A transaction T  is said to contain X if and only if  X  T [4  5   An  association rule implies the form X=> Y, where X  I Y  I, and X  Y  For the association rule 
s two are the basic measures, the support and the confidence Support \(sp\ an itemset \(string\ stands for the number of times that an itemset or sub-itemset appears in the database. Common subpath \(cs\s the common part of the branch paths. The cs is the subpath çabcd Restricted Support is the support given by the first same items that compose the cs. Extensive support is given by extension of the support operation beyond the first cs. The confidence c of the rule is computed as the quotient of the supports for the itemsets c

The Direct Group Mobility We use a collaborative system \(cell-BS-node\with the composition approach, in order to take the mobility trend at special congestion times \(periodical events without taking into account the user mobility profile  The DGM based on  the g roupsê mo ve, can guarantees Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing \(ITCCê05 0-7695-2315-3/05 $ 20.00 IEEE

The proposed Algorithms 4.1. The Tree Path Construction Algorithm TPCON In order to find the group mobility trend  the transformation of the routing table  into tree\(s needed. The purpose of Tree Path Construction TPCON\ to create tree\(s\or each BS, while the MTA finds the connection between the adjacent BSs According to the TPCON  the path with the maximum support is considered as the root. Consecutive paths are placed at the child positions. So éjké is consecutive to the çdjé. An order of the paths is considered at the beginning of each BS \(root\, so that the  next \(greater number \(or successor path\will become the right child of the root \(or the previous node\hile the path with lower number \(or predecessor path\will take the position of the left child. Thus, for BS 2 the path çjk will be the right position of the root çdjé \(ord\(k\d\(j or 5>4\, while the path çgjé will take the left child position of the  çjké \(ord\(g\rd\(k\1<5 4.2. The Merge Tree Algorithm \(MTA The next step after TPCA  is the MTA. The necessity of MTA is based on the ability to find the most critical paths for predefined route or sequence of BSs by finding the connection items among them. In other words in Fig 2, we can find the most popular paths where users move from the starting point BS1 to the BS2.  We compare itemsets \(subpaths\ starting from the root node \(or any node\ the BS1 with  the root node of BS2 A path  BS1, source\at has a connection with any node of  BS2  \(target\ easily be examined  \(without searching the tree\ust by focusing on the root node of BS2 and examining the continuity of their second items Example: If çdhé † BS1  \(Fig.2\en the çdh ç cannot be connected with any  itemset of the tree BS2 \(root djé\ince ord\(h\d\(j\ or 2<4 Example: A node çdké † BS1 can probably have a connection with a node of the BS2 \(like the çdj j\ or  5>4 From the  conf BS1, BS2 conf \(dj, bd\5/90 =0.72 and the  conf BS1, BS2 conf \(el, de\30 =0.66 we finally  have the stronger confidence that is:  conf BS1 BS2 max \(0.72, 0.66\2.

Two values of threshold the th 1 for the predictive case and the th 2 for the adaptive case  are defined.   The adaptive CAC is activated only when cdp>th 2  6.  Simulation For our experiments, we assume the uniform mobility behavior of the users. This means that a user  BS 1 event cells: a,b,c,d,e,f per  sp    cells   IC 10   100   ab      c  10     90   bd      c 10     30   de      c 11     50   bk      c BS 2 cells: g,h,i,j,k,l per   sp   cells  IC 11    65    dj     c 12    30    jk     c 12    15    kl     c  13    60    gj     c Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing \(ITCCê05 0-7695-2315-3/05 $ 20.00 IEEE 


follows a cyclic pattern within a one day period. We use time sub-periods during a day, for several weeks in order to find periodical events\nd examine the mobility of each user. There are two phases of the simulation; the initial and the main. The initial phase contains the path generation and the discovering of the favorite group path while the main one contains the simulation of the arrival and service of users.   The performance of the proposed algorithms is examined for various user mobility patterns and three scenaria are developed below 1. All the kind of users In Fig 3 we have the case of the increase of the call dropping probability during the rush hours. In Fig 4 we have the case of service according to CAC \(predictive\ where the cdp<0.20. In Fig. 5 the CAC \(adaptive\is activated only when cdp>0.30, and then the bandwidth is reserved only for the handoff users. The local users are dropped \(due to lack of available channels\o that the handoff users are serviced 2. Users with branches and restricted support A new set of  user mobility patterns with more branches is considered.  Fig. 6 depicts the adaptive CAC with restricted support Later at t rs 49, the cdp takes lower values than cbp 3.

objective data The data is the adult database in UCI ML Repository 13 W e analysed its test data contain ing 100,000 instances of 40 attributes where 6180 instances are persons having more than 50K USD annual income and the rest are persons having less than 50K USD We splitted the data into two groups according to the 50K USD threshold for a comparative study and high are used since the association among items is so strong that more than 2,000 QFIs are mined even with this  The followings two QFIs are the examples of the comparative study 50K support=69.6 50K support=56.2 The rst QFI is for the persons having more than 50K USD income while the second is for the persons less than 50K USD Under similar support the former is for elders and veterans while the latter is for younger and unemployed persons The upper bound of the dividends as stock owners is far larger in the former The high granularity of the interval values yet maintaining the interpretability shows the high usability of QFIMiner to analyse massive data 4 Discussion and Conclusion QFIMiner evaluates the density in the neighborhood of each transaction projected onto every axis in each candidate dense cluster This enables ner and more accurate detection of dense clusters than the other grid based approaches while maintaining a good efìciency In addition QFIMiner computes the density threshold by the average density in each candidate dense cluster in every subspace This enables more accurate and efìcient detection of dense clusters than by the equi-width grid based and variable density threshold of SCHISM 11 In summary the performance of QFIMiner is superior to the past subspace clustering approaches in terms of its accuracy and efìciency It provides highly comprehensive notions of numeric and categorical clusters in form of QFIs Acknowledgement The authors wish to thank Dr Alexandre Termier in ISIR Osaka Univ for his extensive support to write this paper This research was

CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA. In other words, the number Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00 © 2004 IEEE 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06 N um be r o f C ou nt ed P at te rn s Support Threshold Mafia Min_Conf=0 Min_Conf=0.1 Min_Conf=0.3 Min_Conf=0.5 Min_Conf=0.7 Min_Conf=0.9 Figure 8.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
