Understanding Competition using Big Consumer Search Data  
Understanding competition is essential for every firm. Unfortunately, informati on on who competes 
with whom is scarce Traditional research approaches such as surveys and panels are time consuming, expensive and usually not well applicable to markets with large numbers of consumer durables. Consumer search data from a price comparison site, however, allows for observing consumers search and compare products, revealing which products they consider to be "competing alternatives. We propose and critically compare three methods that use these data to identify, analyze and visualize competitive relationships between products. Finally, our empirical study of 147,336 consumers searching in the consumer electronics product category provides in 
sight into consideration set size and composition, and s hows that the average consideration set size of a co nsumer is 4.38 and the average consideration set of a product is 7.49 
1. Introduction  
Understanding competition has long been recognized as essential for competiti ve strategy. It is the heart of strategic managem  supporting pricing polic ies, product desi gn, product positioning and communic  21  While sales of own prod 
  
ucts are directly observable managers must resort to costly reports from market research firms for information on market shares and sales of competing products. The question of who their competitors are, however, remains unanswered To identify compet itive relationships, research has turned to consumer perception and behavior. When faced with the decision of which product to purchase consumers form a relevant set of alternative products commonly referred to as such, consideration sets provide time- and situationspecific information about consumer preferences and products they perceive as bei ng comp  
Since consumers determine wh ich alternative products to include in their consideration sets, they become the ultimate arbiters of competitive Past research has leveraged consideration sets to analyze competition and market structures. For example, DeSarbo et al. [4 identify co m p etitive relationships and construct market structures based on survey data of jointly considered luxury cars as well as portable telephones. Similarly, Erdem [6 used panel data on repeat purchases of consumer products \(e.g yoghurt, detergent generate market maps Unfortunately, t raditional approaches for 
competitive identification, such as surveys and consumer panel data, are usually prohibitively expensive and time consum may suffer from sample biases, are confined to the cognitive boundaries of the interviewed consumers or require repeat purchases, which deem them inappropriate for consumer durable goods such as smartphones or TV-sets An attractive alternative are online search data of individual consumers. They can be used to identify consideration sets and thus comp etitive relationships between products \(e.g. Moe  data capture actual observed consumer behavior, they 
represent revealed measures of consumer search which are more reliable than survey  Furthermore, online search data are not subject to the limitations of consumers cognitive capabilities when trying to recall past conside ration sets or comparing numerous alternatives in a test setting. And finally technology allows for collecting information about these searches at rather low cost With millions of consumers searching and comparing millions of product s online every day, big data on consumer online search activity should be available for nearly any consumer durable product The challenge lies in capturing sufficiently 
representative online search da ta in a timely and cost effective manner, distilling th e relevant consideration set information from it and generating valid and meaningful output that can easily be grasped by managers The aims of this article are threefold: Firstly, to propose three methods for id entifying competing products, analyzing their relationships along metrics such as consumer interest \(measured by search volume\epicting t he underlying ma rket structure

 The stream of past research devoted to competitor identification and market structure analysis lays testimony to the importance of understanding competitive relationships \(e.g. Erdem Bergen  et al. [4 m p etito r  identification and market structure analysis can be undertaken using different types of data such as consumer surveys, online product offerings  as well as different analytical methods such as cluster analysis \(e.g   m u ltidim ensional scaling \(e.g Erdem  e.g. Green   While some approaches to analyzing market structure and competitiv e relationships are based on product attributes \(e.g. Lee Bradlow [1  draw on consideration sets of consumers \(e.g. DeSarbo et al W e follow the la tter approach since  consumers become the ultimate arbiters of competitive relationships by selectively determining which alternative products to includ e in their consideration  Consideration sets th us provide us with time and situation-specific information about consumer preferences and products they perceive as competitors  to uncover underlying  ma Ho wever, unlike product attributes, consideration sets ar e latent constructs in the minds of consumers and are thus not directly  Previous research has therefore resorted to either panel data \(e.g. Erdem or survey data e g  for the purpose of investigating consumer durable goods in markets consisting of many products. Panel data require repeat purchases common to fast moving consumer goods such as juice or detergents. However consumer durables such as smartphones or TV-sets are purchased only once every few years. Surveys on the other hand are confined to the cognitive boundaries of consumers. This constraint limits surveys to a handful of alternative products that consumers are able to process at the same time and introduces uncertainty of whether consumers are able to correctly recall past purchase decisions or envision future purchase intent With the rapid spread and evolution of the World Wide Web, research has started to circumvent survey and panel data by leveraging user-generated content and online consumer search to analyze competitive relationships and market structures. For instance, Lee  use a textm ining algorith m to  analyze online customer reviews for product attributes of digital cameras and apply clustering techniques to identify the underlying mark et structure. Kim et al  custo m er search data on camcorders from Amazon to estimate consideration sets as basis for mapping market structures using multidimensional scaling techniques Both articles see a major advantage in using online data for market research since these data are less costly and timelier than surveys and panels In this article, we follow the notion of Kim et al  su m er search since it enables us to identify consideration sets and thus competitive relationshi   Moreover, online search data capture actual observed consumer behavior and therefore represent revealed measures of consumer search, which are regarded as more reliable 
in product consideration maps that incorporate product attributes and performance metrics. Secondly, to evaluate the suitability of the three methods for identifying, analyzi ng and visualizing competitive relations. Thirdly, to empirically investigate consideration set composi tion and size in consumer electronics and to compare the results of the three methods Our approach is unique as it is based on big consumer search data from a leading price comparison site that includes clickstr eam data from thousands of unique users in the LED-TV category. A major advantage of using price comparis on site data is that it contains non-aggregated search activity of individual consumers and is not confined to the product catalog and customer base of a single retailer. Moreover, with over one million users searching for product information and prices every day, big consumer search data is available in real-time at low cost. And finally big consumer search data from price comparison sites allow further analysis of consideration set size and composition as well as the development of new performance metrics for competitive analysis We organize the remainder of this article as follows: The next secti on provides an overview of relevant literature for considera tion sets and their application in competitive analysis and market mapping. It is followed by a detailed description of the price comparison site data used in this study. We then propose three methods for analyzing competition Subsequently, we empirically apply these methods to big consumer search data for the LED-TV category Finally, we compare the results of the three methods and close with managerial implications arising out of our findings

 In this section, we provide an overview of the data structure and function of price comparison sites. We then propose three methods, namely consideration ranking, consideration clust ering and consideration mapping. Together, they allow us to identify, analyze and map competitive relationships

3. Methodology 
We are the first to use price comparison site data for observing, processing and analyzing the consideration set formation of individual consumers across a large number of products spanning an entire market. Further, we apply and compare multiple methods and propose performance metrics as basis for better understanding com petitive relati onships. Finally we provide new insight into consideration set size and composition of competing consumer durables. Table 1 compares our study with previous research and outlines that our methods have more features and our empirical study covers more consumers and products than other studies  Price comparison sites continue to gain popularity among consumers as they actively contribute to efficient W ith millions of consumers searching and comparing hundred thousands of products in hundreds of product categories at price comparison sites, price comparison site data provide an encomp assing representation of the market Being an intermediate, price comparison sites provide many value-adding functions such as search tools and an objective comparison of products and  spectru m of consum ers Price comparison site data are thus by definition not confined to the inventory customer base and sales policies \(e.g. pricing and promotion\a single retailer. Moreover, price comparison sites capture revealed measures of consumer search at a nonaggregated, individual level, offering insight into individual customer journeys   To provide an overview of the general structure and content of price comparison sites and to introduce the price comparison site specific terminology used in this article, we provide a fictions example of a typical user journey across a price comparison site In our example, Susan needs a new smartphone and decides to compare several models online. She starts by searching for a smartphone from Apple using Google. Googles search results also include a link to a price comparison site, which Susan clicks on. She is taken to a product details page for the particular Apple smartphone at the price comp arison site. We call this visit of a user to a product detail page a page impression for that particular product. Susan is presented with a general description of the smartphone, technical detail s, pictures, a product video, the average test score of several consumer tests other users opinions and ratings of the product as well as a list of retail offers including price, availability shipping cost, payment optio ns, shop rating and a link to the online-shop of the respective retailer Susan studies the presented information and decides to take a look at an alternative smartphone from Samsung. This time she uses the search bar of the price comparison site to find the Samsung smartphone she is looking for. She is presented with a list of smartphones matching her search terms at the product listing page. Susan clicks on the Samsung smartphone she was looking for, opening its product details page and generating a page impression for this Samsung smartphone model The following day, Susan continues her search and directly enters the URL of the price comparison site and navigates to the smartphone product category using the category navigation menu. To reduce the list of several hundred smartphones, Susan applies filters e.g. display size, WiFi capability\sorts the results by price. She then clicks on a model from HTC and is taken to its product details page \(creating a page

We call this a click on a product offer For the analysis proposed in this article, we would summarize the relevant informa tion of this customer journey as follows: Susan's consideration set size is 3 Each smartphone was viewed by one user \(here Susan\tphone received 2 page impressions The HTC smartphone received 1 click, the others none. The conversion rate from page impressions to clicks \(=CLK/PI\artphone and zero for the Apple and Samsung smartphones Before we can commence with our analysis we must process the clickstream data from the price comparison site. A clickstream consists of a series of actions a user \(or consumer customer journey across a website. We track these actions and log the sequence of products viewed \(by page impression\her j ourney. By allowing for reciprocity and transitivity among the products of a customer journey, we can construct consideration sets that include all products considered  In a first step we translate individual users clickstreams into a relational topology of jointly searched products normalized by the degree of relationship between them. To do so, we first use an automated procedure to process the log files containing the clickstreams of thousands of users tracked at the price comparison site. The procedure identifies and analyzes each individual users clickstream and translates product views \(page impressions of product pages deration sets see Table 2 As depicted in Table 3, the consideration sets are then organized in a joint consideration matrix  expresses the relationship of joint consideration of product j and k observed in the clickstreams of all users  Based on the notion that the degree of competitive relationship between two products is not only relative to how many times they are viewed together but also to the number of times they are each viewed, we apply Linden et normalize the degree of competitive relationship between two products j and k as follows  1   where is the degree of competitive relationship   product k is the number of consumers who searched both and Table 4 shows how the normalized relationships are mapped into matrix     There are two perspectives on consideration set size that must be differentiated. The first, from a consumer point of view, expresses how many products a consumer jointly considers \(see Table 2 The second, from a product point of view, expr esses how big the consideration sets are in which a given product is included \(see Table 3

 3.5. Method 1: consideration ranking  3.6. Method 2: cons ideration clustering 3.7. Method 3: consideration mapping  
In our numerical example the mean consideration set size of all consumers is 2.25 whereas for products it is 2.28  We now conduct consideration ranking based on the normalized consideration matrix see Table 4 to identify the closest competitors of any given focal product. Since matrix is in essence an inverse distance matrix of similarity the greater the value, the more similar\identify and rank competitors of a focal product according to their normalized degree of joint consideration with the focal product. From Table 5 we see that product As nearest competitors are products B and C. As we observe no relationship to product s D and E, we conclude that these products are not in competition with product A We next analyze the competitive relationships in terms of how much interest each competing product attracts number of page impressions\with how many other products it is being considered with consideration set size\inally, we can also compare the conversion rate from page impressions to clicks on offers for each product As shown in Table 5, our competitive analysis indicates product B to be the closest competitor to product A. Furthermore, product B generates more consumer interest that is indicated by the larger number of page impressions. However, product B is not able to convert interest into clicks on offers as well as product A. Finally product A typically faces slightly more competitors than product B as indicated by the slightly larger consideration set size  with similarity data as proximities for the identification of clusters The output of the hierarchical WARD-clustering is summarized in Table 6. The jump of the coefficient between stage 3 and 4 of the WARD linkage processing indicates that the optimal number of clusters is 2 \(number of objects minus step number after which coefficient jumps = 5  3 = 2   From the cluster membership column we see that in the case of two clusters, products A, B and C are competitors as well as products D and E  Although, taken together, consideration ranking and consideration clustering paint a good picture of who competes with whom and how intense these competitive relationships are, they offer little insight into the underlying market structure and positioning a of all products relative to another. We therefore conduct consideration mapping to visualize the underlying market structure and transpose metrics of competitive performance as well as product attributes onto the generated consideration map In a first step we run multidimensional scaling procedures \(P alized  joint consideration matrix The consideration map depicted in Figure 1 shows the close competitive relationship between product s A and B as well as between products D and E as seen in our original normalized joint consideration matrix see Table 
Table 6. Results of consideration clustering  Stage Cluster Combined Coefficient Cluster Membership CL 1 CL 2 
 While consideration ranki ng provides insight on competitors of one product it offers little indication of which sets of products compet e jointly together. We therefore employ hierarchical WARD-clustering to uncover joint competitive rela tionships of multiple  products. The clustering procedure is adapted to directly process our normalized joint consideration matrix

4.\ore, product C is a more distant competitor to product A than B. This finding is also in line with the results of the output of the consideration clustering  In the final step of our analysis, we explore competitive performance and drivers of market structure by transposing performance metrics and product attributes over th e generated consideration map. For instance, we add conversion rates of the observed products to our considera tion map by varying the bubble size of the products accordingly \(the larger the bubble, the higher the conversion rate consideration map not only informs about relative positions of competitors but also about their strength or performance\ms of conversion rate \(see Figure 1\ course, other prod uct attributes or metrics could also be used to represent bubble size and color  In this section we apply the previously introduced methods to empirically demonstrate how they can process price comparison site data to better understand competition   We collected clickstream data in August 2012 from thousands of users in the LED-TV product category of a leading price comparison site. For the purpose of this study, a tracking pixel was developed and installed on all pages of the price comparison site. It allows us to track each user along her journey and capture which products she looks at and on which offers she clicks All user actions are captured with a time stamp that allows us to reconstruct the sequence of actions per user. A major advantage of obtaining consumer search data directly from the price comparison site is that we do not have to rely on error-prone crawler technology or published data summaries that may be indexed normalized and/or truncated   In our data we observe 147,336 users searching and comparing 1,104 products of 55 brands generating 681,692 page impressions on products and 212,260 clicks on the offers of 269 online retailers. See Table 7 for further summary statistics    The average consideration set size \(number of products considered\users is 4.380 with a standard deviation of 4.29 and a positively skewed distribution see Figure 2\inding is in line with that of  ing survey data, found consideration sets of luxury cars to contain 2 to 6 models for the majority of consumers. On the other  estimated the mean  consideration set size for camcorders based on Amazon data to be 14. Both studies observe a long right tail, which we also observe in our data The average consideration set size a product is 7.490 with a standard deviation of 3.096 and a slightly positively skewed distribution \(see Figure 2 Evidently there are some products that are considered with very few others, while at the other end there are products that are considered with many Overall we not only observe different product performance across metrics such as page impressions and conversion rate, but also on consideration set size We later use these metrics to compare products identified as competitors in order to get an indication of their relative competitive strength

  Although the collected data span across 1,104 unique LED-TVs, it is not practical to demonstrate the proposed methods with such a large number of products. The output would be too encompassing to easily follow in this article \(i.e. the joint consideration matrix  better conversion rate and a comparatively smaller consideration set size, making it the stronger competitor of the two. Furthermore most of the closer competition to our focal product stems from same brand products \(3 out of 5\While this finding suggests t hat brand may be a key differentiating attribute for consumers when considering which LED-TV to purchase, it also points to a potential inner-brand cannibalization problem of Philips   We just summarize but do not display the details of the result of consideration clustering. From the agglomeration schedule of the WARD linkage processing we identify the number of optimal clusters to be 20. Cluster size ranges from 1 to 5 with a mean of 2.55. Again the output suggests that brand drives consideration set composition for LED-TVs since all but one cluster consists of a single brand. Our focal product is clustered with only one further competitor Philips 40PFL5007K\e consideration ranking, is also the competing product that is most often jointly considered   We apply PROXSCAL multidimensional scaling procedures to the normalized joint consideration matrix of the top 50 competitors of the focal product \(Philips 40PFL5507K\generate a two dimensional consideration map \(see Figure 3

The resulting matrix  thus captures 1,250 relationships  and proceed to applying our proposed methods Table 8 summarizes the results of the consideration ranking for the top 5 competitors of the focal product The consideration ranking identifies the closest competitors to our focal product as being the Philips 40PFL5007K and Samsung UE40ES6300. Although the Samsung UE40ES6300 is jointly considered less often with our focal product than the Philips 40PFL5007K, it attracts mo re consumer interest \(page impressions

 In order to identify the closest competitors of the focal product easily from the consideration map, we draw a circle around th e focal product encompassing exactly 5 products \(includi ng the focal product\e chose 5 products since the mean consideration set size of the focal product is 4.64 \(see Table 8 consideration ranking and the consideration clustering indicate brand to be a key driver for joint consideration.

By adding metrics such as consumer interest \(page impressions to the consideration ranking we are able to also evaluate the strength of each competing product However, a joint identificati on of competitors and a visualization of the market structure and its drivers cannot be achieved by consideration ranking Consideration clustering allows for a joint identification of competitors. However, it does not disclose which product is closest to a focal product and in our empirical study truncated the list of competitors of our focal product at one Furthermore, consideration clustering does not visuali ze the underlying market structure and its drivers Consideration mappi ng produces a visual representation of all competing products relative to another. By transposing attributes onto the consideration map, it is possible to explore the drivers of the underlying market structure and of the consideration set composi tion of consumers. Although consideration maps provide a relatively good visual representation of which products compete most strongly, they produce no straight forward ranking or grouping of compe ting products      Figure 5 illustrates that a ll methods tend towards similar results. Most considera tion clusters can also be identified as such in the consideration map and the closest competing product of the focal product is in the same cluster as well as nearest in the competitive map Nevertheless, there are some discrepancies such as clusters 16 and 19, where the consideration map indicates that part of cluster 19 should in fact be in a competitive relationship with cluster 16. Also, the product identified through competitive ranking as being the 3 rd closest competitor to the focal product is depicted as further away in the consideration map than for instance the product ranked 5 th  With each method having its own strengths and weaknesses \(see Table 9.\mbination of all three methods allows for an encompassing understanding the competitive environment    We set out to better understand competitive relationships by analyzi ng big consumer online search data from a price comparison site. We found that price comparison site data is an excellent source for this purpose. It provides revealed measures of consumer search from hundred thousands of consumers every day that spans across entire markets of consumer durable goods and provides several performance metrics \(e.g. clicks, impressions attribute data \(e.g. brand, size\characteristic makes them a highly valuable online data source that is timely and available at low cost Our study extends the existing research stream on competitive analysis and provides new insight into consideration set size and composition of competing consumer durables by using big online search data from a price comparison site as basis for observing

processing and analyzing the consideration set formation of individual consumers across a large number of products spanning an entire market Moreover, we propose and demonstrate the feasibility of three methods that all shed light on slightly different aspects of competition. The implications of using only a single method range from underestimating the potency of a competitive product to identifying the wrong products as being competitors. Managers are therefore well advised to employ a combination of the methods proposed in this articl e if they wish to attain a correct and encompassing un derstanding of the competitive situation faced by their brand and products We must however also recognize several limitations of our study. Fi rst, although all products considered by any given user are captured, repeat page impressions of a single product from the same user will be understated if the user opens a separate browser window for each product and switches between these windows instead of viewing them in sequence within a single window.
