F0 analysis for Japanese conversational speech synthesis Hideharu Nakajima and Yoshinori Sagisaka Member, IEEE Abstract This paper proposes a conversational style text-to-speech synthesis scheme based on an analysis of fundamental frequency, F0. Through the analysis, we confirm that conversational F0 ca n be represented by the superpositional model usin g three components ranging utterance, major phrase, and mi nor phrase. We compare each component of the model between conversational style and reading style to investigate the following points: where big F0 discrepancies are found, what linguistic factors concern to the discrepancies, and to what extent do such discrepancies occur This paper uses real domain data that includes a lot of linguistic context. Analysis confirms that la rge differences occur in global components such as single span whole utterances and phrases and that the differences occur at or around domain-specific expressions. The analysis also reveals that local components are almost the same in both styles. These analyses show that it is necessary to estimate the utt erance and phrase components from words attributes other than the grammatical clues to realize conversational synthesis in the super positional manner I I NTRODUCTION EXT-to-speech TTS synthesis can now produce highly natural sounding and prosodic reading style synthetic speech through the introduction of the corpus-based approach   The current level of qu ality has enhanced the use of synthetic speech in various applications that demand human-like conversational inte raction. These applications include for example, story telling for entertainment, voice response for telephone call center automation and sales pitches for voice-assisted e-commerce. However, the prosodic naturalness of conventional TTS remains insufficient Hence, it has become necessary to study  14  We focus on F0 control of conversational speech prosody in terms of the super positional model of F0 and its com   m odels represent F0 as the addition of component curves that have different time spans This approach has merits both in statistical treatment and linguist ic understanding. As it uses the characteristics of curves as a prior and connects each component to prosodic entities, they show local and global features separately without da maging statistical optimization to approximate an observed F0 contour. On the other hand, in other approaches where an F0 contour is directly estimated the F0 pattern configuration is not used as a prior knowledge and instead F0 top line values for each frame \(a smaller unit than phoneme are directly estimated from a lot of parameters of the surrounding linguistic inform 9  T hese approaches require large data sets for training and cannot provide any direct links to the corresponding linguistic factors Manuscript received June 15, 2009; revised August 5, 2009 H.

Moreover, we expect that we can effectively obtain an accurate F0 control model based on intuitive factors by investigating where big F0 discrepancies are found what linguistic factors concern to the discrepancies and to what extent the discrepancies occur This paper uses the real speech of several domains to compare F0 characteristics of conversational and reading styles and investigates F0 ch aracteristics of conversational speech. In previous research, Abe et al. used the data simulated for several domain-s pecific speaking styles and claimed that their global model, which represents the global F0 pattern between accent phrases, is needed for each domain specific However, the local m odel which represents local F0 patterns in accent phrases, can be the same for different speaki  Although this suggests the use of a superpositional model to handle different styles of conversational speech, they didn’t reveal linguistic details because they used common sentences for all domains, domain specificity wa s not considered Sagisaka et  adjectival accent phrase to investigate the relation between conversational F0 and word attributes, and demonstrated that control by the accent component of the command and response m However the r esearch was limited to those expressions. To establish a conversational style TTS for general sentences, it is necessary to analyze other various expressions Given this background, this paper uses real utterances from different domains that have di fferent styles to understand the F0 differences between conversational and reading styles In addition, we use a superpositional model to compare the differences in each component.

As we are going to anal yze the relationship between F0 and linguistic factors, we use a superpositional model that decomposes F0 into the following three components 1\ponent: spans entire utterance length 2 Phrase component: responsible for global patterns between accent phrases 3\Local component: responsible for local patterns in each accent phrase We extract these components through following steps A Utterance Component For description of F0 component spanning over an entire utterance \(or sentence\F0 average and standard deviation for each utterance. We refer it as "utterance component" hereafter B Phrase and Local Component After subtracting the above utterance component from original F0, the pattern is divided into individual accent phrases on the time axis. We refer the average and standard deviation of the pattern in each accent phrase as phrase component" hereafter We subtract the phrase component from the pattern of each accent phrase and we define the remaining pattern as "local component We use the following normalization to extract each component y  x   Here x and y denote variables before and after normalization and correspond to average and standard deviation of x  respectively III M ETHOD OF C OMPONENT C OMPARISON BETWEEN S PEAKING S TYLES To investigate the differences between reading and conversational style, we compare the three components of the F0 model. For this purpose, we chose utterances whose phoneme transcriptions are the same in both reading and conversational styles, that is even devoicing double lengthening, pause insertion are the same in both styles We extract the components of those utterance pairs, and identify the difference between the styles to investigate the location of the differences and the impact of lexical information. F0 value is taken only from the center of voiced vowels As shown in the example in Fig.1, we compare the F0 components between reading and conversational styles. The utterance a Japanese sentence taken from sales pitches, is kaisya-gaeri-wa \(even while going home keitai-de through your mobile phone sy oqpingu \(let’s shopping   phrase t he smallest prosodic unit whose aliases are "the prosodic word or "minor phrase".

It is mild, familiar, and near to but slightly different from news reading style speech Op erators’ speech in telephone conversation \(OP Telephone operators' speech assumed to be uttered to the customers of a telephone call center. It is more colloquial than FT Ap pealing speech in sales talk \(AP Salesclerks' speech uttered to their customers to push their products through mass media commercials. It is more colloquial than OP These domains are almost the same as those assumed in past literatures  r, we call these speech styles conversational \(style As a reference speaking style we recorded these utterances in a straight reading style by the same speaker. They were uttered in a neutral reading style with no intention that the speech was to be used to communicate with others We call this data the "reading \(style For all samples, we attached labels and boundary times of phonemes, pauses, and accent phrases, and also calculated F0 Hz\marizes the resulting speech corpora. The number of accent phrases and total lengths are the average values of three female speakers, all of whom were professional narrators V F0 C OMPONENT C OMPARISON We compare F0 between conversational style and reading style at each three component to obtain factors for conversational F0 control A Utterance Level Comparisons We observe the distributions of the F0 average of each utterance and compare them in terms of domains and speaking styles. Fig.2 shows an example of the distributions of utterance F0 average for one speaker. Distributions are expressed as box-whisker plots with "R statistical computing package \(distributed via http://www.rproject.org Horizontal axis denotes the combination of the domain and speaking style. AP, FT, OP denote domains, plots on the left hand side are for the conversational style, and plots on the right hand side for the reading style. Distribution is plotted vertically.

distribution. Small circles are outliers if present. In each box on the dotted line, the thick line in the box is the 50 percentile the upper edge of the box is the 75 percentile, and the lower edge of the box is the 25 percentile. The longer \(shorter dotted lines is, the broader \(narrower\the same domain, the conversational style \(on the left hand side has greater distribution than the reading style \(on the right hand side\for all speakers Rectangle positions are higher with the conversational style than with the reading style. This means that the conversational style exhibits a higher F0 and broader F0 band than the reading style. Among the conversational style material, AP and OP have greater distributions than FT. Although one speaker showed a different order for AP and OP, FT was still the lowest A naive interpretation might suggest the existence of some factor that is hard to extract from the sentence to be synthesized. The example includes the distance between the speaker and the listener \(while AP and OP have large distances, FT has small distance appealing \(while the intention is strong with AP and OP, it is weak with FT\These differences can be absorbed by a domain-dependent model and data training We examined the relationship between words and utterance F0 averages to investigate factors easily obtained from the text to be synthesized. For example for the conversational style in the AP domain,  the F0 average was high for short sentences that included words that tended to be uttered in high spirits \(e.g., "hatsubai" \(on sale\ or price values at the sentence end\, while the F0 average was low for long sentences that explained the products themselves and impressions of their use Also for the conversational style in the OP domain, acknowledgment showed high F0 average  These observations suggest the necessity for some control of the utterance component based on the word attributes in the sentence. This coincides with our experience we commonly raise our voice to match the sentence or the situation. On the other hand many conventional reading style TTS systems used fixed values for the utterance component T ABLE II SPEAKING STYLE COMPARISON RESULTS 9.2 12.5 24.5 0.4 0.7 89.5 87.5 66.7 0.7 1.0 1.3 1.0 8.8 else 6.4 5.5 8.1 else 88.8 87.8 84.6 0.7 1.0 4.8 6.7 7.3 0.4 0.7 OP FT AP Correlation range c\OCAL COMPONENT CORRELATION 32.3 29.3 23.1 over 1.2 30.2 23.1 25.7 0.8 1.2 37.4 47.6 51.2 under 0.8 OP FT AP Ratio range b\ PHRASE COMPONENT DIFFERENCE RATIO OP FT AP Correlation range a\ PHRASE COMPONENT CORRELATION                      9.2 12.5 24.5 0.4 0.7 89.5 87.5 66.7 0.7 1.0 1.3 1.0 8.8 else 6.4 5.5 8.1 else 88.8 87.8 84.6 0.7 1.0 4.8 6.7 7.3 0.4 0.7 OP FT AP Correlation range c\OCAL COMPONENT CORRELATION 32.3 29.3 23.1 over 1.2 30.2 23.1 25.7 0.8 1.2 37.4 47.6 51.2 under 0.8 OP FT AP Ratio range b\ PHRASE COMPONENT DIFFERENCE RATIO OP FT AP Correlation range a\ PHRASE COMPONENT CORRELATION                      B Phrase Level Comparisons Next we compare phrase components patterns with two measures \(i\correlation coefficient for consistency of phrase moving direction, and \(ii\rence ratio for consistency of variation 1 Correlation Coefficient For phrase level comparisons, we calculated the correlation coefficients \(hereafter called "COR"\phrase components here average values for each utterance. When patterns are the same for two styles COR takes a value close to 1 We classified the utterances by their COR to obtain a distribution of utterances. The result is shown in Table II \(a Table II \(a middle positive correlation, i.e. the range from 0.4 to 0.7 strong positive i.e. over 0.7, and others Values in the Table II \(a of utterances that lie within each region While strong positive utterances were about 67% for AP the equivalent value was near 90% for FT and OP 2 Difference Ratio Since some phrase component patterns gave high COR but the overlap was not clear, we calculated the phrase component difference between neighboring accent phrases and also calculated the ratio of the difference of the conversational style to that of the reading style. When the ratio is close to far from small \(large We define the following tags; ratios under 0.8 are tagged reduction", from 0.8 to 1.2 "almost the same", and over 1.2 expansion". We classified all the changes into these three categories as shown in Table II \(b As the category of "almost the same \(0.8 – 1.2\occupies at most 30%, the phrase component in the conversational style shows large reduction or expansion unlike those in the reading style. As the reading style in this paper is not narrative, it is natural that there is a large difference even in the FT domain Large difference was observed for the following linguistic elements 140 
 


AP\: expressions for product features and impressions interjections, sales specific expressions asking for permission understanding or soliciting, and nominal before pause or sentence end FT\: mimetic and onomatopoeic words, and dialog OP\: honorific expressions  These observations suggest that phrase component control needs to be aware of the contents of the utterance, especially words, and not merely their grammatical attributes. On the other hand, conventional studies use only grammatical information or switch model for domains or target emotions C Local Component Comparisons Up to this point, both utterance and phrase components were eliminated. We compared remaining local component patterns in terms of consistency. For local level comparisons we calculated the correlation coefficients \(hereafter called COR"\of local component patterns between speaking styles for each utterance. When patterns are the same for two speaking styles, COR takes a value close to 1 We classified the utterances by COR to obtain the distribution of accent phrases. The result is shown in Table II c middle positive correlation, i.e. the range 0.4 to 0.7, and strong positive correlation over 0.7 and others. These values are the percentages of accent phrases that lie within each region About 85% of accent phrases in all domains showed strong correlation, over 0.7. We confirmed that local component patterns of accent phrases overlapped when the accent phrases show strong correlation. In low COR accent phrases there was re-ascending at the particle on the phrase end as often mentioned in conventional dialog research. These can be controlled by fitting the re-ascending pattern as already   were som e  accent phrase pairs with strongly negative COR values. For example, the accent phrase consisting of one adverb right before a pause shows a rise on the phrase boundary tone in conversational style, but a fall in reading style, resulting in negative correlation. This suggests the insufficiency of simple inverse transform of norm  Low COR accent phrases occur at sentence end or before after a pause in AP, mimetic and onomatopoeic words, and dialog in FT, and honorific expression in OP, but the actual number of such phrases was small. Local components might sufficiently be predicted from such information as part of speech, accent positions and length that conventional research used VI C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS This paper compared, for conversational style and reading style speech, the characteristics of the components of a super positional F0 model. For the comparisons, we analyzed utterances in the domains of sales pitches, story telling, and telephone conversation in the real world, although conventional researches often used simulated emotion or domain style speech. We found that global components such as utterances and phrases exhibit large differences between the speaking styles, while about 90% of the local components were strongly correlated. By decomposing F0 into three components, we confirmed that conversational F0 can be generated by superimposing reading style local components on conversational utterance and phrase components Based on our observation at utterance and phrase component, the differences occurred at domain specific words \(shown in section V-A and V-B\sentences have the same grammatical structures for both speaking styles those domain specific word attributes must bring the domain dependent prosody even without the specification of the domain. We believe that future important work is the prediction of domain dependent utterance and phrase components from these word attributes  Though conventional research mentions prosody and linguistic functions such as 1\mar, 2\speakers' attitude e.g., Para-linguistic information and emotions relations, and 4\ain specific style, few papers have analyzed the relation between those functions and words in the sentence being synthesized. Further investigation into the relation between words and F0 component difference between speaking styles will lead to a better understanding of the synthesis of those functions. To establish an accurate global model and realize truly fluent conversational TTS future work includes finding the representation that can quantify the relation between words attributes and F0 component difference.

  7  Figure 4 226  Planned Concept of Operations for GRB and eGVAR   5  R ISK R EDUCTION A CTIVITIES  Recent work by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\222s Lincoln Laboratory \(MIT-LL\investigated the potential for using a commercial off-t he-shelf Digital Video Broadcast \(DVB\ to receive and demodulate the received GRB data.  In the MIT-LL research, a commercial DVB-S2 receiver designed for r eceipt of satellite television broadcasts was used to demonstrate the feasibility of a dualpolarized L-band receiver for GRB.  The implementation was shown to have potential for a relatively low-cost upgrade package for existing GVAR users, although further research is planned to explore the impact of moving towards a more non-standard, GRB-like implementation \(such as using CCSDS data content packetization in conjunction with the DVB transport protocol  MIT-LL is also in the pro cess of characterizing the performance of dual circular polarized downlink performance in L-band \(at 1.544 GHz\ance and availability of the GRB downlink in rain conditions presents a concern, and no previous studies have been identified that charact erize a cross-polarization approach in the 1.6 GHz range.  This study combines the search and rescue \(SAR\ink signal from the current GOES-West operational satellite with custom developed MIT-LL hardware and software designed to emulate a dual circular polarized downlink.  Testing occurred at the Wallops, VA Command and Data Acquisition Station \(WCDAS demonstrated that, in all but th e heaviest of rain cases, the effects of dispersion of the cross-polarized signal should not have a significant impact on the availability of the GRB downlink.  One caveat is the testing occurred with approximately a 15 degree elevation angle to the GOESWest satellite from WCDAS.  GRB users at lower elevation angles may encounter greater degradation than measured in this study, and additional effort will be needed to fully characterize the acceptability of the planned GRB implementation for low-elevation angl  GRB Simulator As part of GOES-R system development activities, the GOES-R Ground Segment will provide a GRB simulator capability to enable the testing of user GRB ingest and handling systems.  The GRB simulator will be stand-alone and transportable, and will contain both data simulation and operator-selectable diagnostic features.  These will include scenario and test pattern definition and user configuration settings.  The GRB simulator will be capable of outputting test data in a realistic manner \(i.e., incrementing date/time and header information\for up to five days without operator intervention.  The simulator will also have the ability to inject errors into the simulated GRB data stream and log test results and simulator events.  Use of the simulators by the

The newest iteration of this service GRB, will be provided by the GOES-R series of satellites GRB with dual circular polarization will provide significantly more data to the user than today\222s GVAR.  The rebroadcast enhancements ar e necessary to accommodate the increased spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution of the GOES-R series instrument suite.  GRB offers significant improvement over current direct broadcast meteorological data, and promises to improve operational weather data use in forecasting throughout the Western Hemisphere However, implementing GRB within the user community will require modernization of terminal receiver equipment and software.  While eGVAR will ease the transition to GRB, users will need to upgrad e hardware and software to take advantage of the improved reliability provided by the CCSDS packet standards and additional data collected by the new instruments.  Up-front planning for GRB by the user community will help ensure users are prepared to take advantage of the significant benefits provided by GOES-R series data through GRB R EFERENCES   G.

Integrated architecture of mashups and KMS  can improve and simplify the creation as well as the use of widgets for the user, which is important concerning the user participation within the mashup concept The widgets as additional components exist in parallel to the knowledge services of the KMS. Thus the user can use the specific knowledge services and create own mashup applications with Web services and data. The knowledge services themselves could be provided as widgets. Through this process, every tool can be used flexibly. The combination of knowledge services and the created widgets is done in the personalisation services layer respectively the mashup logic. In case all knowledge services are provided as widgets, this layer only consists of the mashup logic Otherwise the layer has to be extended with personalisation services of the KMS. In the end, the access and output layer provides user profiles which regulate access to the actual KMS and the created mashups. The shared knowledge platform helps to diffuse the created mashups. Moreover, the user has the possibility to modify mashups and widgets, so that in the course of time an evolution of the initial mashups occurs  4. Conclusion  The use of Web 2.0 technologies for corporate knowledge management is currently discussed intensely. In this context wikis, blogs and social bookmarking are often mentioned [41]. However, we have shown that mashups also offer interesting possibilities for knowledge management systems We first analysed mashups as an architecture for KMS. Because of the found similarities and differences, an integration of mashups into a classical KMS architecture was examined afterwards. Through this integrated solution, one can benefit from the special features of mashups as well as of KMS Summarising this paper, it can be said that mashups can be applied as an architecture for KMS. Especially the flexible bonding of new data and services by the user himself increases the usability of such systems and supports knowledge intensive processes. The task for future research will be a closer investigation of mashups in concrete knowledge management scenarios. Two general scenarios are possible. In the first scenario, mashups can be used as a KMS in security uncritical scenarios. In the second scenario for a secure handling of data, an integration of mashup functionalities into a KMS has to be examined. Here especially the interaction between the integration services, the knowledge services and the widgets has to be investigated. For the future, the increasing implementation of mashups in corporate applications can be expected, so that the importance of mashups for KMS will be further rising    Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 5.

 15 increased, and this needs to be considered for the maximum number of nodes in the network. Generally, latency will be largest for the T scheme, so when the range gets larger and larger as it may in some aeronautical networks, this could constitute a problem. In terms of latency, in general, the F scheme is best and then the TF schemes The TF schemes require fewer frequency channels than the F scheme, and most TF schemes employ single carrier transmission. Thus although the F scheme has its own advantages, TF schemes may be good alternatives to the F scheme, especially for the long range aeronautical networks considering characteristics such as flexibility, resource efficiency, etc. Moreover, if n needs to be changed, TF schemes are more convenient because they can change the number of time slots, or if possible, can change the number of frequency channels, or even change both In practice, for both commercial and military applications additional issues arise, such as power constraints, spatial isolation with directional antennas, adjacent channel interference. Among other things, such as the use of spread spectrum, these are areas for future work 9  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we analyzed time, frequency, and multiple time-frequency schemes applie d to the non-redundant uni and bi- directional wireless relay networks, and conducted a straightforward comparison of several duplexing multiplexing/MA schemes in terms of resource allocation constraints, required data rate per transmission to obtain a desired average throughput, required transmit power per link, and relative range. Although commonly employed pure time division techniques appear adequate in some cases, such as short range networks, our results indicate that appropriately designed time-frequency schemes are preferable in terms of data ra te and/or SNR, especially for long range aeronautical networ ks. In addition, we can obtain the conclusion that pure frequency division schemes attain the largest range for a given data rate and performance. We also discussed the capacity and cost of the network, with results that use of frequency division or certain time-frequency divisi on schemes are superior For future work, we can ex tend the analysis of relay network from point-to-point links to point-to-multipoint link, such as in redundant relay network or ad-hoc network   We al so m a y consi d er usi ng spread spect rum t o  separate the user transmissions R EFERENCES   J.

movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
