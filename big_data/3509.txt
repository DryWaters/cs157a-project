I Introduction Electronic commerce sites not only provide an additional channel for marketing and sales they also provide a rich source of information about the customers It is providing an unprecedented opportunity to collect detailed data about all aspects of the commerce activity such as customer purchases browsing patterns usage times and preferences at an increasing rate As corporations look toward the electronic business one thing is clear that it will be hard to continue to capture customers in the future without the help of Web mining Web mining is a key technology to help make sense of all of the data and better understand and facilitate 
electronic commerce Web mining techniques can be applied to understand and analyze such data and turned into actionable information that can support a web enabled electronic business to improve its marketing sales and customer support operations More importantly the fast feedback the companies obtained using Web mining is very helpful in increasing the company's benefit Examples of Web mining in electronic business applications are generation of user profiles enabling customer relationship management and targeting web advertising based on user access patterns that can be extracted from the web data Web mining in electronic business domain is currently a hot research area In general data obtained from electronic business 
transactions are web server access logs proxy server logs browser logs registration data if any user sessions user queries cookies etc l This chapter attempts to present Web mining concepts and issues that are associated with electronic business applications The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the survey of Web mining is discussed Pattern discovery from Web transactions is proposed in Section 3 Section 4 describes analysis of discovered patterns In Section 5 applications of Web mining are discussed Section 6 concludes the paper 11 Web mining Web mining is 
the use of data mining techniques to automatically discover and extract information from Web documentslservices Like other data mining applications Web mining can port from given structure on data as in database tables hut it can also be applied to semi-structured or unstructured data like free-form text Three areas of Web mining are commonly distinguished content mining, structure mining and usage mining 2.1 Web content mining Web content mining is to discover useful information from web contents I data I documents it is a form of text mining for an overview see 3 The primary Web resource that is 
being mined is an individual page Web content mining can take advantage of the semi structured nature of Web page text Web content mining can be used to detect cwoccunences of terms in texts. For example, trends over time may also be discovered indicating a surge or decline in interest in certain topics such as the programming languages Java Another application area is event detection the identification of stories in continuous news streams that correspond to new or previously unidentified events all examples from 141 2.2 Web structure mining Web Structure Mining is to find authoritative Web page retrieving pages that are not only relevant but also 
of high quality or authoritative on the topic The Web consists not only of pages but also of hyperlinks pointing from one page to another these hyperlinks contain an enormous amount of latent human annotation Web structure mining exploits the additional information that is often implicitly contained in the structure of hypertext Therefore an important application area is the identification of the relative relevance of different pages that appear equally pertinent when analyzed with respect to their content in isolation For example hyperlink-induced topic search 5 analyzes hyperlink topology by discovering authoritative information sources for a broad search topic This information 
is found in authority pages which are defined in relation to hubs as their counterparts Hubs are pages that link to many related authorities The search engine Google, for instance owes its success to the Page Rank algorithm which states that the relevance of a page increases with the number of hyperlinks to it from other pages and in particular of other relevant pages 61 2.3 Web usage mining Web usage mining also known as Web log mining is to discover patterns in the browsing and navigation data of 0-7803-7840-7/031$17.00 02003 IEEE 872 


Web users It processes discovering interesting patterns in Web access logs The primary Web resource that is being mined is a record of the requests made by visitors to a Web site most often collected in a Web server log 7 Web server log files provide rich information about Web dynamics and it customarily contains The domain name or IP address of the request the name of the user who generated the request the date and time of the request; the method of the request the name of the file requested; the result of the request success failure error etc the size of the data sent back the URL of the referring page the identification of the client agent;. and a cookie a sting of data generated by an application and exchanged between the client and the server Given the web data the goal is to capture the buying and traversing habits of customers in an electronic business environment Any existing pattern recognition method such as a traditional classification and clustering method can be utilized for this task after applying some preprocessing steps on the data By mining Web usage data more complete knowledge about Web usage can be obtained Web usage mining has been an important technology for understanding users behaviors on the Web For example one may find that most e g 80 of those users who were interested in product A were also interested in product B The identified association rules are at the center of cross-selling and up-selling strategies in electronic commerce sites: When a new user shows interest in product A she will receive a recommendation for product B cf 81 111 Pattern discovery from Web transactions There are a number of issues in preprocessing data for mining that must be addressed before the mining algorithms can be run nese include developing a model of access log data developing techniques to clean/filter the raw data to eliminate outliers andor irrelevant items grouping individual page accesses into semantic units i.e transactions integration of various data sources such as user registration information and specializing generic data mining algorithms to take advantage of the specific nature of access log data 3.1 Preprocessing subtasks 3.1.1 Data cleaning Techniques to clean a server log to eliminate irrelevant items are of importance for Web log analysis The discovered associations or reported statistics are only useful if the data represented in the server log gives an accurate picture of the user accesses of the Web site Elimination of irrelevant items can be reasonably accomplished by checking the suffix of the URL name Current methods include the use of cookies cache busting and explicit user registration 9 3.1.2 IYansaction identification Before any mining is done on Web usage data, sequences of page references must be grouped into logical units representing Web transactions or user sessions A user session is the entire page references made by a user during a single visit to a site Identifying user sessions is similar to the problem of identifying individual users as discussed above A transaction differs from a user session in that the size of a transaction can range from a single page reference to all of the page references in a user session, depending on the criteria used to identify transactions Each page reference is used for either navigation purposes to get to another page or information content purposes These transactions can be used to discover associations between the content pages of a site A given page reference is classified as either navigational or content based on the time spent on the page used in the discovery of user patterns 3.2 Discovery techniques on Web transactions Once user transactions or sessions have been identified as discussed in section 3.1 there ire several kinds of access pattern mining that can be performed depending on the needs of the analyst Some of these discovery techniques are discussed below 3.2.1 Path analysis The most obvious is a graph representing the physical layout of a Web site with Web pages as nodes and hypertext links between pages as directed edges Most of the work to date involves determining frequent traversal patterns or large reference sequences from the physical layout'type of graph Types of path/usage information are as fellows most frequent paths traversed by users entry and exit points disnibution of user session durations user attrition Path analysis could be used to determine most frequently visited paths in a Web site One example of information that can be discovered through path analysis is 70 of clients who accessed company products lfile2.html did so by starting at company and proceeding through company lwhatsnew Icompanylproducts and lcompan ylproductslfilel .html The rule suggests that there is useful information in company /products file;?.html, but since users tend to take a circuitous route to the page it is not clearly marked 3.2.2 Association rules Association rules generation is the discovery of relationships between items in transactions It is typically used for market basket analysis to discover rules of the form k of customers who buy item A and B also buy item C Discovery of such rule for organizations engaged in electronic commerce can help in the development of effective marketing strategies But in addition association rules discovered from WWW access logs can give an indication of how to best organize the organization's Web space For example if one discovers that 80 of the clients accessing company products and company products lfilel html also accessed company products fileZ.html but only 30 of those who accessed company products also accessed company products file2.btml then it is likely that some information in filel.hhn1 leads clients to access file2.html This correlation might suggest that .this information should be moved to a higher level erg company /products to increase access to file2.html 873 


3.2.3 Sequential patterns The problem of discovering sequential patterns lo is to find inter-transaction patterns such that the presence of a set of items is followed by another item in the time-stamp ordered transaction set In Web server transaction logs a visit by a client is recorded over a period of time The time stamp associated with a transaction in this case will be a time interval which is determined and attached to the emsaction during the data cleaning or transaction identification processes The discovery of sequential patterns in Web server access logs allows Web-based organizations to predict user visit patterns and helps in targeting advertising aimed at groups of users based on these patterns By analyzing this information the Web mining system can determine temporal relationships among data items 3.2.4 Clustering and classification Discovering classification rules Ill allows one to develop a profile of items belonging to a particular group according to their common attributes In Web mining classification techniques allow one to develop a profile for clients who access particular server files based on demographic information available on those clients or based on their access patterns In some cases the server can gather valuable information about clients automatically from the client browsers This includes information available on the client side in the history files, cookie files etc Other methods used to obtain profile and demographic information on clients includes user registration;online survey forms, and techniques such as 221\221anonymous ticketing\224 Clustering analysis allows one to group together clients or data items that have similar characteristics. Clustering of client informatim or data items on Web transaction logs can facilitate the development and execution of future marketing strategies both online and off-line such as automated return mail to clients falling within a certain cluster or dynamically changing a particular site for a client on a return visit based on past classification of that client IV Analysis of discovered patterns The discovery of Web usage patterns carried out by techniques described earlier would not be very useful unless there were mechanisms and tools to help an analyst better understand them Hence in addition to developing techniques for mining usage patterns form Web logs there is a need to develop techniques and tools for enabling the analysis of discovered patterns These techniques are expected to draw upon from a number of fields including statistics graphics and visualization usability analysis and database querying In this section we provide a survey of the existing tools and techniques Usage.analysis of Web access behavior being a very new area there is very little work in it and correspondingly this survey is not very extensive 4.1 Visualization techniques Visualization bas been used very successfully in helping people understand various kinds of phenomena both real and abstract Hence it is a natural choice for understanding the behavior of Web users Pitkow I21 has developed the Web visualization system for visualizing WWW access patterns It allows the analyst to selectively analyze the portion of the Web that is of interest by filtering out the irrelevant portions The Web is visualized as a directed graph with cycles where nodes are pages and edges are inter-page hyperlinks 4.2 OLAP techniques On-Line Analytical Processing OLAP is emerging as a very powerful paradigm for strategic analysis of databases in business settings While OLAP can be performed directly on top of relational databases industry has developed specialized tools to make it more efficient and effective the research community has recently demonstrated that the functional and performance needs of OLAP require that new information structures be designed Since the size of server logs grows quite rapidly it may not be possible to provide on-line analysis of all of it Therefore there is a need to summarize the log data perhaps in various ways to make its on-line analysis feasible Making portions of the log selectively in to various analysts may be required for security reasons These requirements for Web usage data analysis show that OLAP techniques may be quite applicable and this issue needs further investigation 4.3 Data and knowledge querying Given the large number of patterns that may be mined there appears to be a definite need for a mechanism to specify the focus of the analysis Such focus may be provided in at least two ways First constraints may be placed on the datahase perhaps in a declarative language to restrict the portion of the database to be mined for e.g Second querying may be performed on the howledge that has been extracted by the mining process in which case a language for querying knowledge rather than data is needed 4.4 Usability analysis This effort is to develop a systematic approach to usability studies by adapting the rigorous experimental method of a computational science The first step is to develop instrumentation methods that collect data about software usability in a manner akin to instrumentation that has been done for analyzing performance This data is then used to build 221computerized models and simulations that explain the data Finally various data presentation and visualization techniques are used to help analyst understand the phenomenon This approach can also be used to model the browsing behavior of users on the Web V Electronic business applications Web mining techniques can be applied to understand and analyze such data and turned into actionable information that can support a web enabled electronic business to improve its marketing sales and customer support operations Based on the patterns found and the original cache and log data many applications can be developed Some examples are given as follows 874 


5.1 Battling to keep customers Assisting electronic businesses to seek and retain the most profitable customers by analyzing demographic data customer-buying and traversing patterns collected online or offline Current 223personalization services\222\222 offer only the ability to track generalized content such as news weather stock quotes 5.2 Maintaining or restructuring web sites Mining of Web data can capture the buying and traversing habits of customers in an electronic business environment and determine the best way to structure the Web site Its goal is to improve Web services and performance through the improvement of Web sites including their contents structure presentation and delivery The built model is capable of categorizing web pages and users and matching between and across web pages andlor users According to the clusters of user profiles recommendations can be made to a visitor on rem visit or to new visitors For example people accessing educational products in a company web site between 6-8 pm on Friday can be considered as academics and can be focused accordingly 5.3 Predicting trend Web mining can predict trend within the retrieved information to indicate future values For example an electronic auction company provides information about items to auction previous auction details etc Predictive modeling can be utilized to analyze the existing information and to estimate the values for auctioneer items or number of people participating in future auctions 5.4 Analyzing association to monitor a competitor\222s web site Web mining techniques can help electronic businesses to find unexpected information from its competitor\222s web sites e.g offering unexpected services and products Because of the large number of competitor\222s web sites and huge information in them, automatic discovery is required For instance association rule mining can be used to discover frequent word combination in a page that will lead a company to learn about competitors  141 5.5 Categorizing web pages Web mining can discover similarity and relationships between different web sites to categorize web pages This categorization will lead in efficiently searching the web for the requested web documents within the categories rather than the entire web The categorization can be obtained by using either clustering or classification techniques Cluster hierarchies of hypertext documents can be created by analyzing semantic information embedded in link smctures and document contents 15 5.6 Promoting campaign Web mining can promote campaign by cross-marketiug strategies across products Web mining techniques can analyze logs of different sales indicating customer\222s buying patterns Associative rule mining can be applied to find frequent products bought together For example, association rule mining can discover rules such as 75 customers who place an order for prcductl from the lcompanylproductll page place the order for product2 from the Icompanylproduct21 page as well 5.7 Intrusion detection and security A template of a user\222s regular usage can be established by analyzing the patterns. A security system can be developed which will cause an alert if the current user\222s behavior is widely different from the template The security system can also restrict the user\222s access to certain online contents 5.8 Targeting potential customers for electronic commerce Classification and clustering of web access log can help a company to target their marketing \(advertising\strategies to a certain group of customers For example classification rule mining is able to discover that a certain age group of people from a certain locality is likely to buy a certain group of products It can also identify potential prime advertisement locations VI Conclusion The mining of Web data is the use of data mining techniques to automatically discover and extract information from Web documentslservices Based on our analysis it is an interesting and important research area Elecwonic wmmerce is providing an unprecedented opportunity to collect detailed data about all aspects of the commerce activity Web mining is a key technology to help make sense of all of this data and better understand and facilitate electronic commerce In the future, more applications of personal Web usage mining will be developed and an electronic business company that incorporates data mining results with its strategy is sure to be succeeded Referrnces l R.Cooley B.Mobasher and Mrivastava J 223Web mining Information and Pattern Recovery on the World Wide Web\224 Proceedings of the ninth International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence 1997 2 0 Etzioni 221The world wide web Quagmire or gold mine\224 Communicationr ofthe ACM 39\(1 I 65-68, 1996 3 S Chakrabarti 223Data mining for hypertext A tutorial survey\224 SIGKDD Explorarions 1:1-11,2000 141 G Cbang M.J.

processing elements Standard LAN technologies were also immature so that we were forced to design and implement our own interconnection networks Now that the circumstances have dramatically changed it is reasonable to use commodity PCs as processing elements and ATM technology for interconnection With ATM connected PC clusters we have only to develop software for parallel query processing So we ported the system software developed for the SDC to our PC cluster system Currently we emulate the device driver layer of the SDC code by user level threads POSIX thread on Solaris 2.5.1 operating system We are also planning kernel level implementation for maximal efficiency Figure 4 depicts the global architecture of our database server Queries issued from the user applications are compiled and optimized at the front-end machine to produce the executable code We take the compiled mode where the generated code consists of the processor\220s native code instead of the interpreted mode for efficiency and flexibility Currently however the SQL compiler and optimizer are not yet ready and the work has to be done by hand That is we determine a plan for the query and write a C code for the plan Execution of a query is initiated by the coordinator program The coordinator broadcasts the generated code to each PC node where a server process for query execution is running Figure 5 shows the structure of the server process called database kernel The database kernel consists of several permanent threads and one of such threads named the dbk server interacts with the coordinator It creates a user thread for executing the code passed from the coordinator and monitors exceptional events from the user thread or the coordinator The exceptional conditions from the user thread are reported to the coordinator and cause user threads running at other nodes to abort The generated code contains only parts specific to the corresponding query such as the initialization and finalization code according to the execution plan and evaluation code for predicates in the query Commonly used code such as hash table manipulation and various conversion routines are contained in the database kernel and are dynamically linked to the target code before its execution Each of the user threads then sets up the I/O streams and registers an operator to each input stream as a callback function Another permanent thread dispatcher keeps polling all the registered input streams and evaluates callback functions with data delivered by I/O threads for disk and network Thus most of the processing is done within the context of the dispatcher and the user thread suspends until the EOF condition is met This model of 217\217centralized I/O\220\220 is designed so as to support multiple queries running at the same time Once execution starts the PCs perform their operations without any centralized control Barrier synchronizations are encapsulated within open and close operations of network connections to simplify the code On completion of the network open operation  dbk  connect  all the nodes are guaranteed to be ready for receiving data and on completion of the network close operation  dbk shutdown  it is guaranteed that no more data will arrive 3.3 Performance evaluation using a TPC-D benchmark query TPC-D benchmark consists of 17 complex queries issued to a database which contains eight Among them the most time consuming query is the query 9 which requires five join operations Figure 6 shows SQL description of the query Here we examine the execution times of this query with different plans We generated a 100GB test database shown in table 2 using a modified version of the dbgen program and partitioned tuples of each relation horizontally over the 100 disks according to the hash values of the primary key In fact NATION and REGION are not partitioned but replicated because they are quite small We didn\220t create any indexes to force the full scan of the relations because the indexes wouldn\220t help ad-hoc queries Figure 7 depicts an execution plan of the query 9 with the right-deep tree First four hash tables are 7 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

4 Data mining 4.1 Association rule mining Data mining which is a recent hot research topic in the database field is a method of discovering useful information such as rules and previously unknown patterns existing behind data items It enables more effective utilization of transaction log data which have been just archived and abandoned Among the major applications of data mining is association rule mining so called 217\217basket analysis.\220\220 Each of the transaction data typically consists of a set of items bought in a transaction By analyzing them one can derive some association rule such as 217\21790 of the customers who buy both A and B also buy C.\220\220 In order to improve the quality of obtained rules a very large amount of transaction data have to be examined requiring quite a long time to complete First we introduce some basic concepts of association rule Let 000 000 001 000 1 001\000 2 001\002\002\002\001\000 000 002 be a set of items and 003 000 001 003 1 001\003 2 001\002\002\002\001\003 001 002 be a set of transactions where each transaction 003 002 is a set of items such that 003 002 004\000  n itemset 004 has support 005 in the transaction set 003 if 005  f transactions in 003 contain 004  here we denote 005 000 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 An association rule is an implication of the form 004 005 n  where 004\001 n 004 000  and 004 006 n 000 007  Each rule has two measures of value support and confidence  The support of the rule 004 005 n is 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002  The confidence 013 of the rule 004 005 n in the transaction set 003 means 013 of transactions in 003 that contain 004 also contain n  which can be written as 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002  For example let r 1 000 001 1 001 3 001 4 002  r 2 000 001 1 001 2 001 3 001 5 002  r 3 000 001 2 001 4 002  r 4 000 001 1 001 2 002  r 5 000 001 1 001 3 001 5 002 be the transaction database Let minimum  support and minimum confidence be 60 and 70 respectively First all itemsets that have support above the minimum support called large itemsets  are generated In this case the large itemsets are 001 1 002 001 001 2 002 001 001 3 002 001 001 1 001 3 002  Then for each large itemset 004  n association rule 004 t n 005 n 001 n 004 004 002 is derived if 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 t n 002 n minimum confidence  The results are 1 005 3 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 75 002 and 3 005 1 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 013\b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 100 002  The most well known algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm[1 We have studied several parallel algorithms for mining association based on Apriori One of these algorithms called HPA Hash Partitioned Apriori is discussed here Apriori first generates candidate itemsets and then scans the transaction database to determine whether each of the candidates satisfies the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence Using these results the next candidate itemsets are generated This continues until no itemset satisfies the minimum support and confidence The most naive parallelization of Apriori would copy the candidates over all the processing node and make each processing node scan the transaction database in parallel Although this works fine when the number of candidates is small enough to fit in the local memory of a single processing node memory space utilization efficiency of this method is very poor For large scale data mining the storage required for the candidates exceeds the available memory space of a processing node This causes memory overflow which results in significant performance degradation due to an excessive amount of extra I/Os HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among the processing nodes using a hash function as in the parallel hash join which eliminates broadcasting of all the transaction data and can reduce the comparison workload significantly Hence HPA works much better than the naive parallelization for large scale data mining The 022 th iteration pass 022  f the algorithm is as follows 1 Generate the candidate itemsets Each processing node generates new candidate itemsets from the large itemsets of the last  001 022 t 1 002 th iteration Each of the former itemsets contains 022 items while each of the latter itemsets contains 001 022 t 1 002 items They are called 022 itemsets and 001 022 t 1 002 itemsets respectively The processing node applies the hash function to each of the candidates to determine the destination node ID If the candidate is for the processing node itself it is inserted into the hash table otherwise it is discarded 13 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
