The relationships are expressed in terms of predicates that describe properties of the data. The two most common types of data relationships, co-occurrence and deviation from expectation, are assessed based on the number or distribution of the tuples in the database that are examples of the predicates. Fuzzy predicates were introduced into the partitioning of attribute domains to produce smooth transitions between classes and to facilitate the modeling with linguistic terms. When predicates are fuzzy, a tuple may partially satisfy a predicate and the notion of being an example is also fuzzy. For mining fuzzy relationships, the standard measures of validity for crisp predicates have been extended to fuzzy predicate8 based on the cardinality of fuzzy sets or on the degree to which the tuples satisfy a fuzzy implication. In this paper we use the notions of fuzzy events and fuzzy partitions to better understand the variations of the validity measures for relationships between fuzzy predicates I. INTRODUCTION The objective of data mining is to discover new and interesting relationships among the data in large databases The language of a knowledge discovery system is defned by a set of predicates that describe properties of the data The predicates determine the granularity of the search space and the scope of the potential relationships. In mining data in relational databases, these predicates frequently cover or partition the attribute domains The application of fuzzy set theory to knowledge discovery has focused on partitioning attribute domains to avoid the unnatural boundaries that occur in crisp domain partitions and to facilitate the linguistic interpretation of the terms 4], [6], [IS]. In addition to providing smooth transitions between classes, partial membership values provide a method for incorporating the distribution of the data within a partition into the assessment of a rule [21 The increase in the representational capability afforded by fuzzy rules and the partial satisfaction of predicates requires modifcations to the standard probabilistic measures of rule acceptance used in data mining. Kouk et al. [14] extended the support and confdence measures to fuzzy associations using a T-norm for conjunction and E-count for cardinality This straightforward generalization led to anomalies in the assessment of data and the development of new measures of rule confdence using aggregation methods other than the C-count [21, [6]-[8], [16]. The preceding proposals were restricted to the generalization of co-occumnce relationships Interest, based on deviation t?om expectation, has received little attention for measuring relationships between fuzzy predicates. The investigations into rule interest in the fuzzy environment [5] ,  [IO] have focused on rule subsumption and variation in hierachical taxonomies In [9], [ 1 I] the number of examples and counterexamples of fuzzy implications have been used as the basis for accepting association rules based on co-occurrence. In this paper, the probabilistic interpretation of validity measures of crisp events provides the basis for the generalization to the assessment of fuzzy predicates interpreted as fuzzy events. This formulation provides a straightforward method for extending measures of both co-occurrence and interest to fuzzy predicates The objective of this paper is not to defne a new class of validity measures, hut to better understand the role of examples in data mining with fuzzy predicates. In particular, we show that the preservation of properties of crisp partitions imposes constraints on the selection of T-norms that may be used to 


constraints on the selection of T-norms that may be used to determine the number of examples of joint fuzzy predicates We begin with a review of the techniques used to measure the confdence or interest in relationships defned by crisp predicates. The standard measures are reformulated in terms of examples and counterexamples to facilitate their extension to the measurement of fuzzy predicates. Section III establishes limitations on T-norms suitable for the determination of ex amples of joint propositions imposed by the requirements that the predicates cover or partition the attribute domains. This is followed by the examination of the impact these restrictions on the support for a data relationship based on the number of examples and counterexamples in a database 11. EXAMPLES, COVERS, AND PARTITIONS In this section we review the terminology and and operations used in the representation of relationships between attributes in a relational database. Although presented in terms of crisp sets, the operations and measures considered in this section are designed to encompass the fuzzy case. In particular, we are interested highlighting properties of the crisp analysis whose extension to the fuzzy case are problematic Following the strategy employed in the assessment of quan titative association rules [17], [MI, [201, predicates are used to defne subsets of the attribute domains. By abuse of notation we will use the same symbol to represent a predicate and the set of tuples that satisfy the predicate. For our purposes, it suffces to consider two attributes A and B. We are interested in the discovery of relationships between tuples in a database SO8 0-7803-8376-1/04/$20.00 Copyright 2004 IEEE R whose A attributes are in a set A C A and whose B attributes are in a set B C B. The database R will consist of n tuples t l , .  . . , t,, where t k  = \(a ik ,  b j k The predicates defne the language of the search process and their associated subsets are assumed to cover, and pos sibly partition, the underlying domain. We let A I ,  . . . A, and B1,  . . . , Bs denote predicates that cover A and U, respectively When there is no confusion, A and B will represent arbitrary predicates from the covers Iluoughout this paper, we will use the characteristic func tion and bjk E B 1, i f x E X 0, otherwise to designate membership in a set or, equivalently, satisfaction of a predicate. When X is fuzzy, the range of p expands from O, 1 The Erst step in the analysis of a database is the summariza tion of the degree to which the tuples satisfy the predicates in the cover. This process is colloquially referred to as 'binning the data'. Adopting the terminology of probability theory, the individual predicates Ai and Bj will he referred to as marginal properties and combinations A&amp;Bj as joint properties For crisp sets, the number of examples of joint properties can he obtained uniquely from the membership of a tuple in the marginals. For the database R n k = l n N \( A , B  denote the number of examples of predicates A, B, A&amp;B where 18 1 = 1 and 1 8 0 = 0 8 1 = 0 8 0 = 0 For fuzzy predicates, it is not the case that the degree to which a tuple \(a,b A&amp;B is uniquely determined by pai b combining function 8 can he any T-norm. The implications of this Wxibility on the assessment of interest or co-occurrence between fuzzy predicates is the topic of the remainder of this paper A minimal property for a set of predicates over an attribute domain is that they cover the domain. If this were not the case, there may be tuples in the database that are unclassifed 


case, there may be tuples in the database that are unclassifed by the predicates. The sets B1,.  . . , B, comprise a cover of B if, for every b E B k = l i=l It is frequently the case that the predicates partition the do main. That is, Bi f lBj  = 0 whenever i # j and B = U:=, B In this case, the inequality in \(1 2 When B1,. . . , B, partition U, the partition property \(2 equivalent to i=l N\(A 4  Bi 3 i= l for any A C A If the cover contains sets Bi and Bj that are not disjoint, an element b E B+ n Bj is an example of both predicates. Thus the inequality in \(1 e PEi \(b 4 i=l In terms of examples and joint distributions for any A g A The mutual exclusivity of equations \(2 4 and covers provide a fundamental difference between the assessment of crisp and fuzzy predicates. In the crisp case the defnition of partition excludes the possibility of sets in the partition having a nontrivial intersection. This is not the case with fuzzy partitions. As we will see in Section HI, the preservation of either \(2 4 potential methods for assessing the degree to which a tuple is an example of a joint fuzzy property 111. FUZZY EVENTS AND PARTITIONS We will now consider the evaluation of the degree to which a tuple is an example of a fuzzy predicate. The following assumptions are used throughout the analysis. The initial premise specifes the degree to which a tuple t = \(a ,b an example of a fuzzy predicate A over an attribute A t = \(a, b a This is the natural interpretation of set membership as satis faction of the predicate and is the underlying assumption for the evaluation of the probability of fuzzy events [19], [23 The second assumption is that the degree to which a tuple is an example of a joint event is the conjunction of the degrees to which it satisfes each of the constituent predicates the degree to which a tuple \(a, b the joint property A&amp;B is p ~ \( a b is a T-norm The fnal assumption is that the predicates over an attribute domain form a fuzzy partition in the style of Ruspini. Thus for an attribute B Al AZ A3 b i=l Partitioning the domains is a standard requirement in many fuzzy applications, which employ triangular or trapezoidal 509 Proof: For any A C d Fig. 1. Intersection in fuzzy panition fuzzy sets to cover the domains. Figure 1 illustrates the domain coverage by adjacent fuzzy sets in a trapezoidal partition The question that we must address is bow to determine the number of examples of a joint property from the number of examples of the marginal properties when the predicates form a fuzzy partition of the attribute space. By A2, the degree that a tuple is an example of a joint property depends upon the selection of the T-norm. Using @ = min, a tuple \(a, b A\(a b A&amp;B to degree .5 but to degree .25 for the product T-norm We will show that the properties of fuzzy partitions induce natural limitations on the T-norms that can be used to assess the degree that a tuple is an example of joint property 


the degree that a tuple is an example of joint property Like crisp partitions, fuzzy partitions satisfy \(2 unlike crisp partitions, the members of a fuzzy partition may not be disjoint. For example, consider the consecutive fuzzy sets in a trapezoidal partition shown in Figure 1. The element b bas non-zero membership in both Bi and B;+1 The relationships established for the crisp case give us two possible constraints on the value of joint distributions. When B1,, , . ,E, form a fuzzy partition, the potential constraints are listed in the table below I I Prooertv I Associated Constraint I I . ,  I The decision to preserve either of these constraints limits the choice of T-norms that may be used to determine the degree that a tuple is an example of a joint property from the marginal membership values. We  rst consider the impact of requiring the satisfaction of C1 and then of the less restrictive constraint c2 Theorems 1 and 2 establish that the product is the only T-norm that ensures the satisfaction of C1 Theorem I :  If @ = product and B 1 , .  . , B, is a partition of 8, then for any A _C A 51 U Theorem 2: Let R be a database with attribute domains A and B and let A a subset of A. The product is the only T-norm that ensures N \( A A ,  4 6 p=1 for all partitions B1,. . . , B, of B and all sets of tuples Pmof: The proof consists of providing a simple domain in which the product is the only T-norm that the can preserve C1 for all possible partitions. Let A = { a }  and B = { b }  be attributes and consider the partitions A1 = x/a, Az = 1-z/a of A and B1 = y/b, Az = 1 - y/b of B. Let R consist of the single tuple \(U, b BY C1 N\(A1 Ai,Bi Ai,&amp 2 = \(z c3 y z @ 1 - y In terms of membership values, this becomes 7 In [I], Alsina established that the product is the only T-norm that satisfes the functional equation z @ Y  c3 4Y for all 0 5 z,y 5 1, where @ is a T-conorm and n is a strong negation. Letting n\(y  be addition, the Lukasiewicz T-conorm, produces the condition given in \(7 Thus Alsina's theorem establishes the product is the unique T norm for evaluating the degree to which a tuple is an example of a fuzzy predicate that ensures the satisfaction of C2. 0 Note that the wording of Theorem 2 does not claim that other T-norms cannot satisfy C1 for particular partitions or data distributions, only that the product is the sole T-norm that satisfes it in all cases. For example, if the sets B1, . . . , B form a crisp partition of B. then C1 holds for any T-norm Condition C1 is also satisfed if the B;s form a fuzzy partition and the B attributes of all the tuples in the database occur only in the cores of the Bis We may, however, choose to maintain the less restrictive property C2. In this case, there is a range of T-norms bounded by product and minimum, which is the T-norm with maximal value, that could be used in the determination of examples o Me confdence m \( A  + B confrm descriptive m f d \( A  + B confm causal m f , \( A  + B ratio rot\(A + B rule interest ri\(A j 8 conelation m r \( A  + B

VALIDITY MEASURES Two general types of relationships have been analyzed in data mining, co-occurrence and interest. Co-occurrence measures the degree to which the satisfaction of a predicate A predicts that of B in the tuples in the database. Co-occurrence is the standard relationship examined in the market basket paradigm [20]. The frst four entries in Table I give several co-occurrence measures formulated in terms of number of examples The confdence measure is the classic measure for assessing the validity of an association. For crisp associations, m \( A B example. The number of examples of an association is specif ically indicated in the numerator, but the counterexamples are relegated to the normalization in the denominator Kodratoff [I31 criticized confdence as a measure of asso ciation validity because it assigns 0.5 to a set of tuples in which 50% are examples and 50% are counterexamples. He commented that this "is too high when descriptive implications are looked for and to low when causal implications are looked for.'' For assessing the validity of a descriptive association such as 'if a customer purchase contains potato chips, it also contains soda' a threshold signifcantly less than 0.5 is appropriate. With an inventory of 10,000 items, the Occurrence of such an implication in 3% of the transactions represents a signifcant relationship. However, it is clear that a causal relationship such as 'if a woman is Swedish, then she has blonde hair' should require a much higher threshold for acceptance Because of the difference in the nature of descriptive and causal implications, Kodratoff proposed separate confrmation measures for each type of association. In terms of examples and counterexamples, Kodratoff's confrmation measure m f d \( A  + B A,  B A,  ' B the number of examples and counterexamples scaled by the size of the database. The range of m f d  is [-1,1] with negative values indicating support for A + 7 B  and positive values for A + B.  For causal associations, the measure m f c \( A  j B A,  B A,  ' B A, ' B includes tuples \(a, b instances. The confrm causal measure is neutral between A + B and A + -B whenever P\(A1B AI7B P\(B1A BI7A  be produced by data distributions satisfying these conditions Rather than basing acceptance on the difference of examples to counterexamples, another approach is to directly consider the ratio of examples to counterexamples [9]. The ratio of ex amples to counterexamples may be obtained from confdence measures by con\(A + B A,  B A + B m \( A  =+ 7 B A,  ' B The fnal two measures in Table 1 are examples of interest ingness measures [ 121, [ 181. Measures of interests measure the deviation of examples from a statistical expectation. Piatetsky Shapiro proposed r i \(A + B A,  B A B The value zero indicates that the occurrence of A and B 


are independent and consequently there is no interest in the relationship of attributes A and B Brin et. al. [3] proposed the symmetric measure to identify correlation of attributes rather. A correlation of 1 indicates no interest, values greater than 1 indicate support for A + B and less than 1 for A + 7 B .  Acceotance of an for descriptive associations is simply the difference between association is based on the chisquared statistic 511 The ranges given in Table I are produced by the assessment of crisp data. In particular, the derivation of these ranges utilize the equality N \( A A&amp;E A&amp;-B This relationship does not necessarily hold when A and B are fuzzy sets Numerous other methods for the measurement of associa tions and attribute relationships have been proposed 1131, [22 The measures discussed above were selected as representa tives of the general classes of confdence and interestingness measures that have natural interpretations in terms of the comparison of examples and counterexamples v. INTERVAL MEASURES By the arguments in Section III, any T-norm  3 whose values are hounded by zy 5 z  3 y 5 min{z,y} is suitable for determining the degree to which a tuple is an example of a joint property from the marginal membership functions. In this section we examine several examples to gain an intuitive understanding of the range of values that can he produced assessing co-occurrence and interest of fuzzy attributes in this manner Once the number of examples of the marginal and joint properties are determined, the validity measures can he ob tained utilizing the formulas in Table 1. We begin with the following simple data set in which the membership values of the tuples exhibit a perfect gradual relationship TI: nu;her A i !  E 0.2 0.2 1 0.1 0.1 Using the T-norm min, the number of examples of A&amp;B is 2.0, of A&amp;-B is 0.6, and of -A&amp;-B is 2.0. The corre sponding values for the product T-norm are 1.5, 0.5, and 1.5 The measures yield con min 0.8 prod 0.39 confd  mnfC rat ~i COTT 0.1 0.03 3.3 0.15 1.6 0.12 -0.07 0.76 -0.05 0.78 Due to the symmetry in the data, the number of examples of A&amp;B and -A&amp;TB are identical. This causes confd and rat to have neutral values for both T-norms. In this case, the selection of the T-norm causes a signifcant variation in the result only in the case of standard confdence and correlation The next example considers tuples that would intuitively support a certainty relationship between A and B. That is, the Dienes implication max\(1- A\(a b C m  confd min 1.0 0.0 prod 0.75 0.0 of these tuples 0.2 0.1 cmfc Tat Ti COTT 0.2 1.0 0.25 2.0 0.25 1.0 0.23 1.5 B\(b 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.9 512 


512 The T-norms min produce 2.0 examples of A&amp;B, 0.6 of A&amp;+3, and 0.6 of -A&amp;-B. The corresponding values for the product T-norm are 1.7, 0.3, and 0.3. The measures yield prod I 0.85 I 0.7 I 0.35 I 5.7 I 0.0 1 0.0 As with the data in TI, there is a notable difference between the confdence measures with the two T-norms. There are also differences in the ratio of examples to counterexamples and the interest measures. The analysis of the examples generated by the minimum indicate that the association A =$ B may he of interest. However, with the examples produced by the product T-norm, both of the interest measures are neutral One fnal example considers tuples tuples with no discem able pattem af T m={a,b,p with parameter p .  Setting p to 0 produces the minimum and 1 produces the product. For a particular set of data, the optimal T-norm could he identifed by Ending the value of the parameterp E [0,1] that maximizes the validity measure under consideration. The optimization could use either algebraic or numeric methods, hut the latter seem more suitable for the analysis of large data sets VI. CONCLUSION The determination of the degree that a tuple is an example of a fuzzy rule or association depends upon the underlying relationship between the attributes. In data mining, this re lationship is not known a number of possible methods for determining 'examplehood' should be considered. When the attribute domains are covered or partitioned by the predicates the relationship between joint and marginal distributions im pose restrictions on the suitability of T-norms to evaluate the degree a tuple is an example of an association. The parametric representations of T-norms presents the possibility of simultaneously learning both the relationship between the attributes and the proper assessment of the number of examples and counterexamples REFERENCES I] C.

efficiency then AOFI. However utilization of fuzzy concept hierarchies provides more flexibility in reflecting expert knowledge and so allows better modeling of real-life dependencies among attribute values, which will lead to more satisfactory overall results for the induction process. The drawback of the computational cost may additionally decline when we notice that, in contrast to many other data mining algorithms, hierarchical induction algorithms need to run only once through the original \(i.e. massive dataset. We are continuing an investigation of computational costs of our approach for large datasets ACKNOWLEDGMENT Rafal Angryk would like to thank the Montana NASA EPSCoR Grant Consortium for sponsoring this research REFERENCES 1] J.

the initial global candidate set would be similar to the set of global MFIs. As a result, during the global mining phase the communication and synchronization overhead is low  0 2 4 6 8 1 0 Number of Nodes Figure 5. Speedup of DMM 4.4.2 Sizeup For the sizeup test, we fixed the system to the 8-node con figuration, and distributed each database listed in Table 2 to the 8 nodes. Then, we increased the local database sire at each node from 45 MB to 215 MB by duplicating the initial database partition allocated to the node. Thus, the data distribution characteristics remained the same as the local database size was increased. This is different from the speedup test, where the database repartitioning was per formed when the number of nodes was increased. The per formance of DMM is affected by the database repartitioning to some extent, although it is usually very small. During the sizeup test, the local mining result of DMM is not changed at all at each node The results shown in Figure 6 indicate that DMM has a very good sizeup property. Since increasing the size of local database did not affect the local mining result of DMM at each node, the total execution time increased just due to more disk U 0  and computation cost which scaled almost linearly with sizeup 5 Conclusions In this paper, we proposed a new parallel maximal fre quent itemset \(MFI Max-Miner \(DMM tems. DMM is a parallel version of Max-Miner, and it re quires low synchronization and communication overhead compared to other parallel algorithms. In DMM, Max Miner is applied on each database partition during the lo 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 Amwnt of Data per Node \(ME Figure 6. Sizeup of DMM cal mining phase. Only one synchronization is needed at thc end of this phase to construct thc initial global candi date set. In the global mining phase, a top-down search is performed on the candidate set, and a prefix tree is used to count the candidates with different length efficiently. Usu ally, just a few passes are needed to find all global maximal frequent itemsets. Thus, DMM largely reduces the number of synchronizations required between processing nodes Compared with Count Distribution, DMM shows a great improvement when some frequent itemscts are large \(i.e long patterns employed by DMM for efficient communication between nodes; and global support estimation, subset-infrequency based pruning, and superset-frequency based pruning are used to reduce the size of global candidate set.

sketch-index in answering aggregate queries. Then Section 5.2 studies the effect of approximating spatiotemporal data, while Section 5.3 presents preliminary results for mining association rules 5.1 Performance of sketch-indexes Due to the lack of real spatio-temporal datasets we generate synthetic data in a way similar to [SJLL00 TPS03] aiming at simulation of air traffic. We first adopt a real spatial dataset [Tiger] that contains 10k 2D points representing locations in the Long Beach county \(the data space is normalized to unit length on each dimension These points serve as the  airbases  At the initial timestamp 0, we generate 100k air planes, such that each plane \(i uniformly generated in [200,300], \(ii, iii destination that are two random different airbases, and iv  the velocity direction is determined by the orientation of the line segment connecting its source and destination airbases move continually according to their velocities. Once a plane reaches its destination, it flies towards another randomly selected also uniform in [0.02, 0.04 reports to its nearest airbase, or specifically, the database consists of tuples in the form &lt;time t, airbase b, plane p passenger # a&gt;, specifying that plane p with a passengers is closest to base b at time t A spatio-temporal count/sum query has two parameters the length qrlen of its query \(square number qtlen of timestamps covered by its interval. The actual extent of the window \(interval uniformly in the data space \(history, i.e., timestamps 0,100 air planes that report to airbases in qr during qt, while a sum query returns the sum of these planes  passengers. A workload consists of 100 queries with the same parameters qrlen and qtlen The disk page size is set to 1k in all cases \(the relatively small page size simulates situations where the database is much more voluminous specialized method for distinct spatio-temporal aggregation, we compare the sketch-index to the following relational approach that can be implemented in a DBMS. Specifically, we index the 4-tuple table lt;t,b,p,a&gt; using a B-tree on the time t column. Given a count query \(with window qr and interval qt SELECT distinct p FROM &lt;t,b,p,a&gt WHERE t?qt &amp; b contained in qr The performance of each method is measured as the average number of page accesses \(per query processing a workload. For the sketch-index, we also report the average \(relative Specifically, let acti and esti be the actual and estimated results of the i-th query in the workload; then the error equals \(1/100 set the number of bits in each sketch to 24, and vary the number of sketches The first experiment evaluates the space consumption Figure 5.1 shows the sketch index size as a function of the number of sketches used \(count- and sum-indexes have the same results more sketches are included, but is usually considerably smaller than the database size \(e.g., for 16 signatures, the size is only 40% the database size 0 20 40 60 80

Figure 5.2a illustrates the costs of both algorithms for countworkloads with qtlen=10 and various qrlen \(the index used in this case has 16 sketches also illustrate the performance of the relational method which, however, is clearly incomparable \(for qrlen?0.1, it is worse by an order of magnitude we omit this technique Sketch-pruning always outperforms na  ve \(e.g., eventually two times faster for qrlen=0.25 increases with qrlen, since queries returning larger results tend to set bits in the result sketch more quickly, thus enhancing the power of Heuristics 3.1 and 3.2. In Figure 5.2b, we compare the two methods by fixing qrlen to 0.15 and varying qtlen. Similar to the findings of [PTKZ02]4 both algorithms demonstrate  step-wise  growths in their costs, while sketch-pruning is again significantly faster The experiments with sum-workloads lead to the same observations, and therefore we evaluate sketch-indexes using sketch-pruning in the rest of the experiments 4 As explained in [PTKZ02], query processing accesses at most two paths from the root to the leaf level of each B-tree regardless the length of the query interval Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE sketch-pruning naive relational 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 number of disk accesses query rectangle length 300 0 100 200 400 500 600 1 5 10 15 20 number of disk accesses query interval length a qtlen=10 b qrlen=0.15 Figure 5.2: Superiority of sketch-pruning \(count As discussed in Section 2, a large number of sketches reduces the variance in the resulting estimate.

Given a query, this tree facilitates the retrieval of all qualifying tuples, after which a post-processing step is performed to obtain the Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE number of distinct planes \(in the sequel, we refer to this method as 3DR method introduces a regular res  res grid of the data space, where the resolution res is a parameter.

Conclusions While efficient aggregation is the objective of most spatio-temporal applications in practice, the existing solutions either incur prohibitive space consumption and query time, or are not able to return useful aggregate results due to the distinct counting problem. In this paper we propose the sketch index that integrates traditional approximate counting techniques with spatio-temporal indexes. Sketch indexes use a highly optimized query algorithm resulting in both smaller database size and faster query time. Our experiments show that while a sketch index consumes only a fraction of the space required for a conventional database, it can process 


required for a conventional database, it can process queries an order of magnitude faster with average relative error less than 15 While we chose to use FM sketches, our methodology can leverage any sketches allowing union operations Comparing the efficiency of different sketches constitutes a direction for future work, as well as further investigation of more sophisticated algorithms for mining association rules. For example, heuristics similar to those used for searching sketch indexes may be applied to improve the brute-force implementation ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Yufei Tao and Dimitris Papadias were supported by grant HKUST 6197/02E from Hong Kong RGC.
