monly used in differential mining of sub-string patterns and related to the search for emergent patterns  T his conjunction denoted C  is de\036ned informally as follows to occur more than a given minimal number of times in a dataset r 1  and to occur no more than a given maximal number of times in a second dataset r 2  and to satisfy a constraint on the size of the pattern  Such a conjunction has been shown to be useful in several contexts For instance let us assume that r 1 resp r 2  contains descriptions of molecules that are active resp inactive against a given organism and that the language of patterns concerns linear fragments i.e strings in such molecules Then computing solutions of C can provide an interesting hypothesis within a drug discovery process  A second typical e xample concerns abstractions of WWW logs r 1 and r 2 for different periods of time i.e sets of sequences of events during browsing sessions Computing solutions of C can help to identify period-speci\036c patterns i.e signatures  A nother recent application o f such a conjunction is where r 1 resp r 2  contains promoter sequences of genes that are involved resp not involved in a given biological process such that solutions of C can suggest regulation mechanisms and new transcription factor binding sites  In this paper our main contribution is a method based on pattern space sampling and not on data sampling to estimate the number of patterns satisfying a user-de\036ned constraint The approach is simple but we demonstrate empirically that it is ef\036cient and accurate for guessing promising parameter settings To the best of our knowledge such an idea has not been reported previously Moreover we are more 037exible than methods based on a global analytical model To support this claim we show that it can be combined easily with three different symbol distributions Furthermore we believe that because of this 037exibility it has the potential for handling other pattern domains i.e other types of patterns and constraints and to support the integration of various background knowledge in the estimate The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 speci\036es the mining task and considers different parameter tuning approaches The method to estimate the number of patterns satisfying the conjunction of constraints is described in Section 3 Section 4 presents an empirical evaluation Related work is discussed in Section 5 Section 6 brie\037y concludes 2 Tuning parameters We consider string database mining and the context of substring pattern extraction under a typical and non trivial conjunction of primitive constraints Let 002 be a 036nite alphabet then a string 002 over 002 is a 036nite sequence of symbols from 002  The language of patterns L is 002 002  i.e the set of all strings over 002  A string database r is a multi-set 1 of strings from 002 002  The length of a string 002 is denoted  002   and 002 i represents the i th symbol of 002  A substring 002 003 of 002 is a sequence of contiguous symbols in 002  and we note 002 003 002 002  The primitive constraints we use to specify the string mining tasks are a minimal frequency constraint on one dataset a maximal frequency constraint on another dataset and a syntactic constraint We also consider two kinds of pattern occurrences exact occurrences and soft ones The concept of soft occurrence is useful to handle degenerated occurrences of patterns in many real-life application domains e.g motif discovery in genomics browsing patterns for WWW usage mining Let us now de\036ne more precisely these notions and the corresponding frequency constraints An exact occurrence of a pattern 002 is simply a substring of a string in r that is equal to 002 The exact support of 002  denoted supp E  002 r   is the number of strings in r that contain at least one exact occurrence of 002  Notice that multiple occurrences of a pattern in the same string do not change its support Let 003 be a positive integer then a 003 soft occurrence of a pattern 002 is a substring 002 003 of a string in r havingthe same length as 002 and such that hamming  002 002 003  003 003  where hamming  002 002 003  is the Hamming distance between 002 and 002 003 i.e the number of positions where 002 and 002 003 are different The 003 soft support of 002 is the number of strings in r that contain at least one 003 soft occurrence of 002  It is denoted supp S  002 r 003   Example 1 If r   atgcaaac acttggac gatagata tgtgtgtg gtcaactg   we have supp E  gac r  since only string acttggac contains gac  We also have supp S  gac r  1  4 because atgcaaac  acttggac  gatagata and gtcaactg contain some 1-soft occurrences of gac  Deﬁnition 1 Frequency constraints In the case of an exact support given a threshold value f  the minimal resp maximal frequency constraint is MinFr  002 r f  004 supp E  002 r  005 f resp MaxFr  002 r f  004 supp E  002 r  003 f  For a 003 soft support the constraints are deﬁned as MinFr  002 r f  004 supp S  002 r 003  005 f 006 supp E  002 r  005 1 and MaxFr  002 r f  004 supp S  002 r 003  003 f  Notice that in the case of the soft support our de\036nition of MinFr enforces the presence of at least one exact occurrence to discard patterns that only occur as degenerated instances  useful for instance when looking for transcription factor binding sites The generic conjunction of constraints considered in this paper is C\004 MinFr  002 r 1 f 1  006 MaxFr  002 r 2 f 2  006 C synt  002   where r 1 and r 2 are string databases f 1 and f 2 are frequency thresholds and C synt is a syntactic constraint 1 The dataset may contain multiple occurrences of the same string

on the pattern We have been using the quite simple syntactic constraint C synt  002  004 002   k  where k is a user de\036ned size value However let us emphasize that our framework can easily be extended to other constraints like C synt  002  004 002  op k where op can be 003 or 005  As mentioned in the introduction this generic conjunction has been shown to be useful in many application domains differential mining appears as a simple but powerful way to integrate domain knowledge and thus to support domain driven data mining In an exploratory data mining task based on pattern extraction one of the most commonly used parameter tuning strategies in the early exploration stage is to run a few experiments with different settings and to simply count the number of patterns that are obtained Then using some domain knowledge the user tries to guess some potentially interesting parameter settings After that stage the user enters a more iterative process in which she/he also looks at the patterns themselves and at their scores according to various quality measures and uses her/his knowledge of the domain to focus on some patterns and/or to change the parameters by some local variations of their values We want to support the early exploratory stage such that the user can guess promising initial parameter settings We propose to probe the parameter space in a more systematic way so that it could be possible to provide graphics that depict the extraction landscape i.e the number of patterns that will be obtained for a wide range of parameter values This idea is very simple and many if not all of the practitioners have one day written their own script/code to run such sets of experiments However in many cases the cost of running real extractions for hundreds of different parameter settings is clearly prohibitive Instead of running real experiments a second way is to exhibit an analytical model that estimates the number of patterns satisfying the constraint C  with respect to the distribution of the symbols and the structure number of strings and size of the datasets and with respect to the values of the parameters used in C  In this approach the effort has to be made on the design of the model and in most cases this is a non-trivial task For instance to the best of our knowledge in the literature there is no analytical model of the number of patterns satisfying C\004 MinFr  002 r 1 f 1  006 MaxFr  002 r 2 f 2  006 002   k when the distribution of the symbols is represented by a 036rst-order Markov chain and when soft-occurrences are used to handle degenerated patterns even in the simple case where 003 1  Designing an analytical model to handle this case is certainly not straightforward in particular because of the speci\036c symbol distribution that has to be incorporated in the model We propose a third approach based on the following key remark When a pattern 002 is given together with the distribution of the symbols the structure of the datasets and the values of the parameters in C  we can compute P  002sat C   the probability that 002 satis\036es C in this dataset In most cases designing a function to compute P  002sat C  is rather easy in comparison to the effort needed to exhibit an analytical model that estimates the number of patterns satisfying the constraint C  Having at hand a function to compute P  002sat C   the next step is then to estimate the total number of patterns that will be extracted but without having to compute P  002sat C  for all patterns in the pattern space Therefore we propose a simple pattern space sampling approach that leads to a fast and accurate estimate of the number of patterns that will be extracted Finally we can compute such an estimate for a large number of points in the parameter space and it provides views of the whole extraction landscape 3 Estimate based on pattern space sampling 3.1 Symbol distributions and probability to satisfy the constraint We choose three symbol distributions to show that our method can be used with different models However this choice is not central in the contribution and depending on the application domain other dedicated models that would be more accurate could be used to provide a better estimate The three models of distributions retained here are M E  independence of all occurrences of the symbols with equal occurrence frequencies of each symbol M D  independence of all occurrences of the symbols with different occurrence frequencies of the symbols M M  a 036rst-order Markov chain For each of the three models mentioned above it is easy to compute the probability for a given pattern 002 to occur in a string then to obtain the probability to satisfy a frequency constraint using a binomial law and to 036nally determine P  002sat C   3.2 Estimate of the number of patterns satisfying the constraint Let S C be the set of patterns in L that satisfy the constraint C\004 MinFr  002 r 1 f 1  006 MaxFr  002 r 2 f 2  006 C synt  002   In this section we present a simple method to estimate  S C  by sampling the pattern space and using a function that gives P  002sat C  for any pattern 002  Let us associate to each pattern 002 a random variable X 002  such that X 002 1 when 002 satis\036es C and X 002 0 otherwise Then  S C   002 002 004L X 002  Considering the expected value of  S C   by linearity of the expectation operator we have E   S C   002 002 004L E  X 002   Since E  X 002   P  X 002

1  0  P  X 002 0  then E   S C   002 002 004L P  002sat C   Let S C synt be the set of patterns in L that satisfy C synt As P  002sat C  for all patterns that do not satisfy C synt  we have E   S C   002 002 004 S C synt P  002sat C   Computing this sum over S C synt would be prohibitive since we want to obtain E   S C   for a large number of points in the parameter space Thus we estimate E   S C   using only a sample of the patterns in S C synt Let S samp be such a sample then we use the following value as an estimate of E   S C     S C synt   S samp   003 002 004 S samp P  002sat C  In practice many techniques can be used to compute the sample In the experiments presented in the next section we use the following process  Step 1 build an initial sample S samp of C synt sampling with replacement of size 5 of C synt  and compute the estimate of E   S C     Step 2 go on sampling with replacement to add 1,000 elements to S samp  Compute the estimate and if the absolute value of the difference between the new estimate and the previous one is greater than 5 of the previous estimate then repeat Step 2 Since the variables X 002 are not independent the occurrence of a pattern has an impact on the possibility of occurrence of other patterns there is no straightforward analytical con\036dence bound of the estimate It is out of the scope of this paper to further discuss this issue However in the next section we show that the estimate is quite accurate in practice 4 Experiments 4.1 Empirical evaluation of the estimate To empirically assess our method we have to check both its ef\036ciency in terms of running time and accuracy Recall that we may need to estimate the expected number of patterns satisfying a user-de\036ned constraint for a large number of values in parameter domains We generated three pairs of random datasets r 1 and r 2  and on each pair we performed a set of experiments Each pair is based on a different symbol distribution and/or on a different dataset structure The symbol distributions used for the estimate were the same as the ones used for the generation For each set of experiments we present graphics to compare the estimate of the expected number of patterns versus the real number of patterns extracted in the datasets when using the same parameters In the experiments we explore different regions in the parameter space at different scales and we do not try to focus on parameter ranges that lead to the best estimates In the experiments we consider the extraction of all patterns satisfying MinFr  002 r 1 f 1  006 MaxFr  002 r 2 f 2  006  002   k  varying the minimal resp maximal support threshold f 1 resp f 2  and the size k  using in turn both exact supports and soft supports with 003 1  In all graphics the isolated dots represent the estimates the dots linked by a line represent the real number of extracted patterns the minimal support corresponds to the horizontal axis and the number of patterns corresponds to the vertical axis for the sake of readability we use for some of the graphics a log scale axis The settings used for the three sets of experiments are the following  First set of experiments Figure 1 4 symbols with distribution M D frequencies of the symbols are 0  4  0  1  0  2 and 0  3  datasets r 1 and r 2 contain 100 strings of length 1,000  Second set of experiments Figure 2 4 symbols with distribution M M  datasets r 1 and r 2 contain 100 strings of length 1,000 The arbitrary conditional probabilities Prob  002 i  Y  002 i  1  X  used for the Markov chain with symbols A B C and D are given by the table 002 002 002 002 002 X Y A B C D A 0.2 0.28 0.18 0.34 B 0.04 0.36 0.3 0.3 C 0.32 0.08 0.2 0.4 D 0.2 0.24 0.24 0.32  Third set of experiments Figure 3 8 symbols with distribution M E  datasets r 1 and r 2 contain 100 strings of length 30,000 In four of the graphics the estimates are so close to the real values that the corresponding dots are superimposed In all experiments the estimates closely follow the trends of the real extractions and in most cases the estimates are suf\036ciently accurate to give a reasonable picture of the shape of the extraction landscape For each experiment only between 4  000 and 8  000 sampled patterns were necessary to converge to a stable estimate i.e the difference between two successive estimates is smaller than 5 of the 036rst one The experiments were run on a Linux platform with an Intel 2Ghz processor and 1Gb of RAM The real pattern extractions on the datasets were performed using the Marguerite 9 1 prototype implemented in C that supports constraint-based string mining with exact and soft

supports and that handles in particular the conjunction of constraints used in this paper The estimate of the number of patterns based on the pattern space sampling was implemented in Perl For each single extraction with exact support the running time was about a few tens of seconds to a few minutes In the case of soft support an extraction takes from a few tens of minutes to several hours to complete while for the sampling-based estimate computing one estimate requires between 1 and 30 seconds 4.2 Application to Real Data We use two datasets of DNA sequences that are promoter sequences of genes Each sequence is a string of 4,000 symbols over an alphabet of size 4 nucleotides a c g and t  The 036rst dataset r 1 contains promoter sequences of 29 genes and dataset r 2 contains promoter sequences of 21 genes These two datasets represent two biologically opposite situations of interest and extracting string patterns that have a high support in r 1 and a small support in r 2 is a way to identify putative binding sites of transcription factors molecules that bind on the promoter sequences to activate or to repress a gene The data were prepared and provided by Dr Gandrillon and his team We look for patterns satisfying MinFr  002 r 1 f 1  006 MaxFr  002 r 2 f 2  006 002   k  and for the support we used the soft support de\036nition with 003 1 slightly degenerated occurrences Such a conjunction of constraints with soft support de\036nition based on the Hamming distance has been shown to be useful in practice for transcription factor binding sites identi\036cation  The estimates were computed with distribution M D using as symbol frequencies their respective frequencies in the data 0.23 0.26 0.27 0.24 respectively for a c g and t  In this case the model is more a description of the random background than a description of the biological organization along the sequences Representative graphics obtained using these estimates and depicting portions of the extraction landscape are presented in Figure 4 on the right A typical use of such graphics is for instance to look for points in the parameter space corresponding to a large support on r 1  but a low support on r 2  a large pattern size and a rather small number of expected patterns since here the distribution represents the random background Such a point that can be used as an initial guess of the parameters to perform real extractions is for instance pattern size 10  minimal support on r 1 of 15 and maximal support on r 2 of 5 the graphic in the middle on the right indicates that for this setting only about 1 pattern due to the random background is expected For the sake of completeness in Figure 4 on the left we give the real numbers of extracted patterns In practice these graphics are not easily accessible to the user since in these experiments the running time of a single extraction ranges from several tens of minutes to several hours while for an estimate only a few tens of seconds is needed Even though the global trends correspond to the estimates they are important differences in some portions of the parameter space these differences could be expected since the distribution used does not incorporate complex biological knowledge However the estimates can still be used to help to choose initial parameter values in an exploratory mining stage and moreover 036nding such differences when running the real extractions can also be a useful piece of information in itself For example for the setting pattern size 10  minimal support 15 and maximal support 5 we have about 100 patterns really extracted while we expected only one If we suppose that the pattern space sampling can provide reasonable estimates when the data satisfy distribution M D as supported by the experiments of Section 4.1 then the 100 patterns obtained are likely to be due to a particular unknown structure in the data and not to the distribution M D only This suggest that it makes sense to look for patterns in this region of the parameter space since we can expect to obtain some interesting/useful patterns not only patterns due to the random background captured by M D  5 Related work Estimating the expected number of patterns that satisfy a constraint is in general much more dif\036cult than estimating the probability that a given pattern satis\036es such a constraint This second problem has received a lot of attention leading to many statistical measures to assess the interestingness of the patterns Concerning the 036rst problem only a few solutions have been proposed and 8 analyze the feasible distributions of frequent itemsets also of closed itemsets for and of maximal itemsets f or 12  focuses on the k ind o f d istrib utions one can e xpect for various kinds of datasets They answer the question whether there exists a frequent or maximal frequent itemset collection that has a given number of frequent itemsets of a given length computes the a v e rage number of frequent closed itemsets using probabilistic techniques These authors especially focus on minimal frequency threshold and how it in\037uences the number of extracted patterns considering 036xed and/or proportional thresholds Another approach has been proposed by Geerts et al  p ro viding a tight upper bound on the number of candidate patterns that can arise while mining frequent patterns in a level-wise setting Given the current level and the current set of frequent patterns they propose a tight bound of the maximal number of candidate patterns that can be generated on the next level In the domain of string mining designs an estimate of the number of patterns due to the random background and that are likely to be extracted with respect to

a frequency constraint and according to the structure of the dataset These proposals are all based on a global analytical model i.e an interesting approach that needs however to develop complex and speci\036c models As a result they cannot be easily extended to handle complex conjunctions of constraints to incorporate different symbol distributions or different semantics for pattern occurrences To the best of our knowledge no method has been proposed to estimate the number of patterns satisfying a constraint while avoiding to develop a global analytical model Our approach requires only to know how to compute for a given pattern its probability to satisfy the constraint this can be obtained in many situations and it remains ef\036cient in practice by adopting a pattern space sampling scheme 6 Conclusion Using constraints to specify subjective interestingness issues and to support actionable pattern discovery has become popular Constraint-based mining techniques are now well studied for many pattern domains but one of the bottlenecks for using them within Knowledge Discovery processes is the extraction parameter tuning This is especially true in the context of differential mining where domain knowledge is used to provide different datasets to support the search of truly interesting patterns From a user perspective a simple approach would be to get graphics that depict the extraction landscape i.e the number of extracted patterns for many points in the parameter space We developed an ef\036cient technique based on pattern space sampling that provides an estimate on the number of extracted patterns This has been applied to non trivial substring pattern mining tasks and we demonstrated by means of many experiments that the technique is effective It provides reasonable estimates given execution times that enable to probe a large number of points in the parameter space Notice that domain knowledge is also exploited here when selecting the distribution model Future directions of work include to adapt the approach to other pattern domains and to different constraints Another interesting aspect to investigate is the use of more sophisticated sampling schemes e.g that could b e incorporated in the approach when more complex syntactical constraints are handled e.g a grammar to specify the shape of the patterns Acknowledgments This work is partly funded by EU contract IQ FP6-516169 Inductive Queries for Mining Patterns and Models and by the French contract ANR-MDCO14 Bingo2 Knowledge Discovery For and By Inductive Queries We thank Dr Olivier Gandrillon from the Center for Molecular and Cellular Genetics CNRS UMR 5534 who provided the DNA promoter sequences References  J F  Boulicaut L De Raedt and H  M annila e ditors Constraint-Based Mining and Inductive Databases  volume 3848 of LNCS  Springer 2005  C  B resson C K e ime C F a ure Y  Letrillard M  B arbado S San\036lippo N Benhra O Gandrillon and S GoninGiraud Large-scale analysis by SAGE revealed new mechanisms of v-erba oncogene action BMC Genomics  8\(390 2007  L  C ao and C  Z hang Domain-dri v e n actionable kno wledge discovery in the real world In Proceedings PAKDD’06 volume 3918 of LNCS  pages 821ñ830 Springer 2006  G  D ong and J  L i Ef 036cient mining of emer ging patterns discovering trends and differences In Proceedings ACM SIGKDD’99  pages 43ñ52 1999  F  Geerts B  G oethals and J  V  d en Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans on Database Systems  30\(2 2005  U  K eich and P  A  P e vzner  S ubtle motifs de\036ning the limits of motif 036nding algorithms Bioinformatics  18\(10 2002  S  K ramer  L De Raedt and C  Helma M olecular f eature mining in HIV data In Proceedings KDD’01  pages 136 143 2001  L  L hote F  Rioult and A  S oulet A v e rage number of frequent closed patterns in bernouilli and markovian databases In Proceedings IEEE ICDM’05  pages 713ñ716 2005  I  M itasiunaite a nd J.-F  B oulicaut Looking for monotonicity properties of a similarity constraint on sequences In Proceedings of ACM SAC’06 Data Mining  pages 546ñ552 2006  I Mitasiunaite and J F  Boulicaut Introducing s oftness i nto inductive queries on string databases In Databases and Information Systems IV  pages 117ñ132 IOS Press 2007  I Mitasiunaite C Rigotti S Schicklin L  M e yniel J F  Boulicaut and O Gandrillon Extracting signature motifs from promoter sets of differentially expressed genes Technical report LIRIS CNRS UMR 5205 INSA Lyon France 2008 23 pages Submitted  G Ramesh W  M aniatty  a nd M J Zaki F easible itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proceedings ACM PODS’03  pages 284ñ295 2003  F  Zelezn  y Ef\036cient sampling in relational feature spaces In Proceedings ILP’05  volume 3625 of LNCS  pages 397 413 Springer 2005
