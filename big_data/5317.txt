Secure and Controlled Sharing of Data in Distributed Computing 
In todayês world there is a strong need for sharing big data for collaboration However privacy and security remains a barrier especially when dealing with massive amounts of data in the Cloud In particular there is a growing need for the data owner to gain better access control over their 
Abstract 
data The data owner should be able to specify how their data should be viewed copied and modiìed A dishonest authorised user may illegally redistribute the data to other friends and/or colleagues who donêt have the relevant access permissions In this paper we address these issues by introducing the idea of 
which controls how data can be accessed and used SafeShare encapsulate data in self-controlling objects SCOês and additionally monitors operations of the user We demonstrate that our SafeShare system will prevent the user from carrying out any illegal operations including illegal redistribution of data In addition we add another level of 
SafeShare 
security on the SCOês by adding a log le and hash for better auditing control 
I I NTRODUCTION There is a growing trend among people today to share and collaborate large amounts of data with each other  Businesses and or ganisations beneìt through greater productivity and efìciency when big data is shared or exchanged with business partners around the world using Cloud technology  Millions of social users are also beneìtting through greater enjoyment and an enrichment of life when sharing personal photos videos and stories with

friends and family using Facebook and Twitter W ith the growing improvements and accessibility of technology it is expected that the demand for sharing massive amounts of data using a variety of new technologies will become prominent in future generations Although the future of big data sharing and collaboration in distributed systems seems promising privacy and security issues continue to be a barrier to its progress  especially when dealing with big data stored in the Cloud  Furthermore there is growing demand by data owners to be able to control how and where their data should be accessed viewed modiìed and distributed Once the data is outside the perimeter of the data owner the data owner 
will no longer be able to have any control over their data A dishonest recipient can easily redistribute the data to other unauthorised users via email attachments USB drives and in cases of documents printing to paper Furthermore in Cloud storage data is usually replicated a number of times and stored in multiple locations around the world to account for higher availability In terms of access control many works focus on using a promising technique called Attribute-Based Encryption ABE where users with certain attributes can access the data if those attributes satisfy the access control policy set out by the data owner    Ho we v er  once 
the data is decrypted at the userês site that user can then redistribute the decrypted data to other users relatively easily Digital Rights Management DRM ha v e allo wed data owners in particular lm and music artists to remotely control how their data should be viewed accessed and distributed However many users have regarded DRM to be controversial and limiting Some of the limitations include only opening the le using speciìc software or hardware opening the le a limited number of times or only at certain times of the day and having to input a login and password every time a le is opened These limitations only hinder the 
convenience of data sharing and collaboration in distributed environments In our solution we attempt to make the access control and monitoring as transparent as possible to the user We introduce the idea of a self-controlling and selfmonitoring object called SafeShare which encapsulates encrypted data and allows access to authorised users only We extend the work of Squicciarini et al by incorporating a monitoring and auditing mechanism within the object We take advantage of CP-ABE and ElGamal encryption schemes to de v elop a system called which will enable secure data sharing and 
SafeShare 
  
collaboration in the Cloud 
Finally we demonstrate our technology and discuss how our system can be used on a wide variety of operating systems and hardware making it feasible for everyday users to use our system The paper will be organised as follows In Section 2 we discuss related work on data access control in distributed systems followed by preliminary work used to help us develop our model and protocol in Section 3 In Section

4 we provide our data model a detailed explanation of our protocol and nally follow up with a security analysis In Section 5 our implementation details will be outlined and our experimental results analysed Finally in Section 6 we summarise our ndings and conclude the paper II R ELATED W ORK Chen et al proposed b undling data with an access policy and sending this bundle to authorised users and untrusted applications The proposed architecture called DataSafe which enable to convert policy into hardware tags with parts of data associated with it such as parts of documents electronic health records etc which helps provide better access control However that data can only be accessed on DataSafe machines with special hardware limiting the ability for user to gain access anywhere anytime Our system can be used on any hardware and on any operating system requiring only the Java Runtime Environment Sundareswaran et al also b undles the data with an access policy Additionally a log le is also bundled with the data Any operation the user carries out will be appended to the log le and this log le will be periodically sent to the Cloud A data owner can then access the log les to check whether data is being used appropriately This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks as well as attacks related to disassembling the bundled JAR le to read contents as logs will notify this To prevent the tampering of log les a hash function is used to verify integrity The problem with this is that it does not deny control of the user to carry out illegal operations such as redistributing copies without permission Our solution incorporates both log les and data control against illegal operations Squicciarini et al uses the idea of self-controlling objects SCOs to control how data is used Data policies user-created policies and jurisdiction-based policies are encoded in the SCOs along with the data The relevant permissions are also created with the SCO The solution uses CP-ABE for policies and hence breaking and reverse-engineering an SCO will still not retrieve plaintext data unless user is authorised However the user can still redistribute to other unauthorised users The work presented in this paper is based on SCOês however we go beyond the current solution and extend SCOs to provide better data access control Kayem pro vides a solution which pre v ents authorised users from illegal data exchange The solution uses an invisible digital watermark which is a hash of the encrypted data and key However it doesnêt provide the data owner full control such as how data is to be viewed or how many copies should be made Burnap et al proposed a solution where parts of the data remain encrypted thoughout its lifetime and can only be decrypted if the user has access rights However once the data is decrypted the user can still carry out illegal operations Kirkpatrick et al described a solution which enabled data access only to known tursted devices A unique device is characterised by Physically Unclonable Functions PUFs However many users never stick to one machine when working and are likely to use a number of different machines One of the distinct features of the Cloud is the ability to access data anywhere anytime hence the need to provide more exibility compared to this solution III P RELIMINARIES Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption CP-ABE  in v olv es encrypting data with an access control polic y  A user can decrypt data if and only if the attributes included in his private key satisfy the access control policy The scheme consists of the following four algorithms  Using a security parameter as an input the Setup algorithm outputs the public parameters and a master key  will be used for the encryption of data and for the generation of user attribute private keys  Takes as input the set of User Attributes  the Master Key  and outputs user attribute private key   Takes as input the data  an access control policy  and public parameters  and outputs the ciphertext   Takes as input the ciphertext  user attribute private key  If the set of attributes in the key satisìes embedded in  it returns ElGamal encryption invented by T ElGamal is a public-key cryptography system We take advantage of ElGamal Encryption in our work since the algorithm is both simple and efìcient and can provide simple user revocation with low cost and overhead There are three main steps of the ElGamal encryption algorithm Initialisation Given a prime  a primitive root of  compute  where is a randomly selected secret key The public key is thus and private key is  Encryption Generate random value and encrypt data as follows 1 Also note Decryption This decrypts with secret key as follows 2

C SCO SafeShare A Model SafeShare 
Self-Controlling objects SCOs introduced by Squicciarini et al pro vides an ef fecti v e w ay to protect data from being redistributed illegally Data contents and access policies are encapsulated and bundled in these objects The objects can then control who can access data and under what conditions it can be accessed We incorporate the use of SCOs in our work to provide stronger yet exible security protection which allows data owners to share data with many users and prevent leakage of data by dishonest users IV T HE S AFE S HARE S YSTEM We now introduce our architecture and in particular discuss our secure data sharing model and protocol Figure 1 SafeShare Data Sharing Model Our secure data sharing model is highlighted in Figure 1 Table 1 summarises the role of each entity in our data sharing model We assume throughout the rest of this paper that the DSS is honest-but-curious in the sense that the system will follow the protocols strictly but is always curious to nd out any information about stored data Note in our data model we assume the CDS DSS and Proxy Services to be semitrusted making our solution attractive to be used in a real world scenario We also assume the DC to be a semi-honest user since it will not be possible to completely prevent the DC from illegally redistributing data to other users since the DC can nd other avenues such as taking screenshots photographs etc However we attempt to make it difìcult for the curious DC to redistribute data based on commands from the software stack such as copy/paste Hence the DO can feel comfortable to some degree that in most cases their data will not be misused by curious DCs We also note that our work makes use of obfuscation techniques to help control the curious DC from illegally sharing the DOs data Code obfuscation is a weak protection mechanism and DO Data Owner The owner of the data and decides who has access permission to the data DC Data Consumer Any user who has permission to access data given by the DO SSA SafeShare Application An application the DO runs to generate a SafeShare object and store to Cloud see model DSS Data Sharing Service The service that carries out most of the data sharing functionality in the protocol see model CDS Cloud Data Service The service that allows calls to be made to Cloud storage see model CS Cloud Storage Database The database containing encrypted data see model  We extend upon SCOs and add a mechanism within the object that will prevent users from carrying out operations denied by the DO Figure 2 illustrates our SafeShare object Each SafeShare object encapsulates encrypted data contents using both symmetric key encryption and CP-ABE We also make use of ElGamal encryption to enable efìcient user revocation which cannot be achieved by CP-ABE alone Each SafeShare object also contains an access control policy governing which users can access data what users can do with the data and any jurisdiction policies associated with the data A hash is also kept of the original data for integrity purposes Finally a log le is kept which logs user operations on the data for auditing and accountability purposes Each SafeShare object also contains operations such as access to data and/or make copies of the data if permitted by the data owner Figure 2 SafeShare object

We now provide a brief overview of our system First the DO stores his data to the Cloud by running the SSA and inputting his data and access permissions The SSA carries out the encryption of the data and access control policies and encapsulates them into a SafeShare object along with secret keys hash value log etc The SafeShare object is then sent to the DSS and consequently the CDS for storage When a DC requests access to data and the DO approves the DO calls SSA to authorise the DC The SSA calculates new private key pieces for the DC which add up to the private key used to decrypt data Each proxy server stores a part of the DCês key partition and the remaining key partition is sent to the DC through a medium of the DOês choosing such as USB email phone etc Once the SafeShare object is decrypted the DC calls the method to access data and provides his CPABE private key as well as his supplied key partition The SafeShare object veriìes with the ACP what operations are allowed on the data and decrypts the data and keys if the attributes in the CP-ABE key satisfy the policy set out in the encrypted data Once the conditions have been met the background process will then start which monitors for any illegal operation see next section When a DO wishes to completely revoke a particular user from data access to his data he simply calls the DSS to remove the DCês corresponding key partitions in the proxy servers The background monitoring process aims to prevent a curious DC from carrying out illegal operations on the DOs data Unless speciìed by the DO in the ACP the background process does not allow the DC to modify copy and/or paste the le to a USB or another folder for sharing The background process rst creates a temporary folder and stores the decrypted le in the folder The folder is made available to the DC When the DC attempts to make a copy of the decrypted le through usual commands such as Ctrl-C on Windows the background process checks with the ACP if the operation is allowed and if not immediately deletes the le in the temporary folder and leaving the clipboard empty Similarly when the DC is not allowed to make modiìcations to his le the background process continually checks whether the le is modiìed If the le is modiìed the new le is immediately deleted and the user would need to run the SafeShare object again to retrieve the original le A log le is also kept if DO requires additional control and is periodically ushed to the Cloud to prevent large data sizes on the DCês machine The DO can then retrieve the log le from the Cloud for auditing and/or accountability purposes We now discuss in detail our SafeShare protocol The protocol has 5 stages namely     and  The DO runs SSA to encapsulate their data within a SafeShare object and stores to the CS 1 DO SSA INPUT   2 Generate p,b,c x 3 Hash  4 Generate log and key k 5 6 7 8 9 Create SafeShare object SSA Obfuscate le 14 DO DSS credentials DSS CDS verifyCredentials\(credentials 16 CDS DSS DSS Generate DSS CDS CS In the data storage stage the DO rst inputs his le policies and public parameters from ABE to SSA on his PC 1  The application will generate public and private key pairs from the Initialisation stage of the ElGamal encryption algorithm 2  A hash of the le will then be calculated 3  A empty log le will also be generated as well as a symmetric key 4  The le will rst by encrypted by symmetric key 5 and then using the access control policy the CP-ABE public key 6  The access control policy data hash log le and symmetric key will also be encrypted individually by the ElGamal public key 7 10  The application will then generate and store the encrypted le along with the encrypted access control policy data hash log le and symmetric key in an object le which we call SafeShare 11 12  Also one partitioned key piece will also be stored in a variable in the source code of the SafeShare object 12 and will then be obfuscated 13 so that it will be extremely difìcult to reverse engineer the code to nd out the key piece value This can only be found out through the running of the executable The DO then sends the SafeShare object along with his credentials to the DSS 14 The DO keeps the secret key on his machine The DSS veriìes the user credentials 15 16  and then generates a data id 17  The SafeShare object is then sent to Cloud storage 18  Note we assume that the DO exists in the database with a user id If the DO does not exist in the database intuitively the data will not be stored The DC requests the DO to access speciìc data stored in the CS and the DO approves

explicitly states in the ACP to enable logging the watchdog will log any operations to the log le and update the object with the latest log The SafeShare object will periodically ush the log le to the DSS to ensure le sizes do not exceed a maximum range 9  The DO revokes access rights over his data from the DC by calling the DSS 1 DO DSS deleteUser\(credentials DSS CDS verifyCredentials\(credentials 3 CDS DSS for all proxy i DSS proxy i removeKeyPiece DSS Remove When the DO decides to revoke a user access rights to data he simply calls the DSS to request the user to be revoked rights to the data 1  The DSS will then verify the credentials of the user 2 3 and then provided the user exists remove the corresponding key pieces of the user in each of the proxy databases 4  Note that the data does not need to be re-encrypted and none of the other userês will be affected since only the key pieces corresponding to the consumer is removed All other key pieces corresponding to other consumers still remain in the proxy database Since the data does not need to be re-encrypted nor does their need to be any key re-distribution the model is efìcient and has a runtime of O\(n where n is the number of proxy servers We now analyse our model and protocol from a privacy and security perspective 1 Data remains encrypted at all times whether it is in transit within the Cloud provider or on the DCês machine The only time the data is decrypted is when the method is called since the class le contains the remaining key partition Since the SafeShare object is obfuscated the value of the key partition will be extremely difìcult to reverse engineer Without the key partition value even if the attacking user has all other partitions he still does not possess knowledge of the full ElGamal private key and cannot decrypt the data Since key partitions are stored in different proxy servers possibly modeled and implemented on different CSPs unauthorised data access becomes extremely difìcult This is due to the fact that compromising all CSPs is almost impossible 2 The symmetric key is also encrypted with the ElGamal private key and also requires the key partition value in the obfuscated source code to retrieve the full CP-ABE key needed to decrypt data When the object method is run and the user has fulìlled all other requirements needed of the object the object will decrypt the data itself and then monitor operations on the decrypted data in a background process as a watchdog If the ACP denies redistribution the watchdog code will prevent the DC from copying the decrypted data to another folder and sending an email attachment for instance The watchdog is non-intrusive of user behaviour and only monitors actions on the relevant data ownerês les to check for any illegal operation It does not interfere nor log the user actions on other les and applications 3 User revocation involves simply removing a DCês key partitions from the proxy By doing so the DC can never recover the full ElGamal private key The key partition stored on the DCês machine will be rendered useless and without the other key partitions The DC also never knows the full value of the private ElGamal key unless it is leaked by the DO Without the full key it is nearly impossible to decrypt the CP-ABE key needed to decrypt the data It is also extremely difìcult to decrypt the metadata information such as the ACP hash value and log le 4 If the DO has highly conìdential data for extra security he can explicitly state that all operations on the data to be logged All operations on the data will be noted by the watchdog and appended to the log le The log le will be periodically sent to the DSS web service where the DO can access anytime anywhere to keep track of the usage of his data and to satisfy his auditing/accountability requirements 5 While the watchdog is running in the background the updated hash value can also be sent to the DSS periodically The DSS will update the previous hash value to the current one in the database The DO can later check whether his data has been tampered with and can also hold accountable who tampered with the data We have not focused on this aspect in great detail in this paper due to limited space V I MPLEMENTATION AND E VALUATION We now provide the implementation details of our system followed by experimental results and an evaluation We developed our prototype of the system using the Java programming language The DSS CDS and Proxy servers were developed using Java Apache Tomcat and Apache Axis2 We also used MySQL for data storage The CPABE scheme developed by Wang and implements the work by Bethencourt and Sahai et al The code was developed using the Java Pairing-Based Cryptography Library jPBC library T o implement the SafeShare object we made use of executable JAR les The SSA was implemented using Java Proguard w as used to obfuscate and shrink the JAR le

B Experimental Results Open C Evaluation 
We carried out a number of performance tests on our system In particular we measured the overhead introduced in our SafeShare object in comparison to sharing data using only the CP-ABE scheme We measured the performance of generating and opening of SafeShare objects The purpose of these tests was to determine whether our system would be feasible to be used in a real-world scenario To carry out the tests we used a dual-core ASUS laptop with 2GB memory 350GB storage and Windows Vista Operating System as well as a Dell XP 8500 PC with Intel Core i7 and 8GB memory running Windows 8 For each of the tests we used a number of les with sizes ranging from 1KB to 60MB to reîect different application requirements The les used in the tests ranged from simple text les to documents and also different image formats For larger les we used video les with different formats and 3D graphics les For each le the performance tests were run a number of times The average time was then calculated and displayed in the gures below Using the same set of les we also measured the performance for the CP-ABE scheme of Bethencourt and Sahai et al This allo wed us to measure the performance overhead of our SafeShare object Figure 3 Data encryption overhead Figure 3 highlights the results of our rst tests From the gure it is clear that SafeShare objects took much longer compared to a simple CP-ABE encryption scheme This is due to the SafeShare object having to encrypt each of the access control policy hash and log le as well as the data itself and then package all these contents into a JAR le As le sizes increased the data generation times increased considerably for SafeShare objects with the largest le size taking 50 seconds while the CP-ABE scheme only had a little increase in time The slight dip in overhead of les around the 10MB mark is accounted for testing carried out in different times but is nevertheless still similar to all the le sizes below 10MB Figure 4 Data access overhead The overhead introduced when a user carried out data access was also measured using the same set of les Figure 4 illustrates the results of our tests where again we measured our SafeShare scheme with the CP-ABE scheme This is the result of running the operation of the SafeShare object We found that for les up to 10MB in size the overhead in access times was nearly negligible However once the le sizes got larger the access times increased exponentially leaving a large overhead compared to the CPABE scheme For les with sizes of 60MB the user would have to wait approximately 5 minutes to access data each time The access times for the CP-ABE scheme remained minimal no matter how large the le was From the performance tests we found our SafeShare object to be comparably slower to encrypt and decrypt Regarding the encryption this is mainly to do with the generation of JAR les Data access times increase exponentially for larger data sizes however as processing power increases and the generation of JAR les optimises this will improve access times in the near future In our current solution users may be willing to wait a little longer for highly conìdential data to generate and access data For instance a business user may be willing to wait for a little more than a minute to access 15MB of highly conìdential paperwork This makes our solution highly attractive to users who are more concerned over privacy compared to performance times VI C ONCLUSIONS There is a growing demand for big data sharing and collaboration in distributed environments such as the Cloud One of the main issues with big data sharing in such environments is the privacy and security of information In particular the issue of illegal redistribution of data by dishonest users and the need to keep data highly conìdential
