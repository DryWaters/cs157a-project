A Flexible GridFTP Client for Scheduling of Big Data Transfers\nEsma Yildirim\nDepartment of Computer Engineering\nFatih University\nBuyukcekmece, Istanbul, Turkey\nesma.yildirim@fatih.edu.tr\nAbstract—Big Data generated in massive amounts by digital\nsources ranging from scienti?c instruments, business trans-\nactions to the social networks, has changed the way we\nunderstand and handle data. It has caused scienti?c and\nbusiness community, as well as governments to focus on urgent\ntechnologies and policies to provide novel tools for manage-\nment, analysis, access and scheduling of Big Data. These tools\nhave to be ?exible and scalable enough to be able to manage\ndata in exa-scale with the help of data centers that can hold\nthousands of compute and storage nodes interconnected with\nhigh speed networks. In this study, we target the performance\nimprovement that might have been achieved from scheduling\nof big data transfers and provide a ?exible client based on a\nvery widely adopted and acclaimed protocol GridFTP. The\nlatest client provided by the Globus Toolkit project does\nnot answer to the needs of highly intelligent optimized data\ntransfer algorithms. With this ?exible client, developers can\nimplement various kinds of scheduling algorithms as well as\napply optimization techniques like pipelining, parallelism and\nconcurrency in much less restricted use cases. The ability to\nenqueue, dequeue, combine, sort and divide data transfers\ninto groups helped apply these techniques easily resulting in\nperformance improvements in terms of throughput in high-\nspeed networks. The client was used to implement two different\nalgorithms which were able to exploit its abilities and provided\nperformance improvements in both cases comparing to baseline\nGridFTP and optimized UDT results.\nKeywords-Big data; data scheduling, GridFTP, client,\nthroughput optimization\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBig Data refers to large, diverse complex, longitudinal\nand distributed datasets generated from various sources\nsuch as scienti?c instruments sensors, internet transactions,\nemail, video, click streams and all other digital sources\navailable today or in the future [1]. Large scienti?c ex-\nperiments, such as environmental and coastal hazard pre-\ndiction [2 climate modeling [3], genome mapping [4],\nand high-energy physics simulations [5], [6] generate data\nvolumes reaching hundreds of terabytes per year [7]. Data\ncollected from remote sensors and satellites, dynamic data\ndriven applications, digital libraries and preservations are\nalso producing extremely large datasets for real-time or\nof?ine processing [8], [9]. This data deluge in the scienti?c\napplications necessitates collaboration and sharing among\nthe national and international education and research insti-\ntutions which results in frequent large-scale data movement\nacross widely distributed sites. These datasets are only\ngetting bigger and bigger making them harder to manage\nand share with other researchers. A very similar trend is\nseen in the commercial applications as well. According to\na recent study by Forrester Research [10], 77% of the 106\nlarge organizations that operate two or more data-centers run\nregular backup and replication applications among three or\nmore sites. Also, more than 50% of them have over one\npetabyte of data in their primary datacenter and expect their\ninter-datacenter throughput requirements to double or triple\nover the next couple of years [11]. As a result Google is\nnow deploying a large-scale inter-datacenter copy service\n[12] and background traf?c becomes important in Yahoos\naggregate inter-datacenter traf?c.\nSeveral optical networking initiatives such as, ESnet [13],\nGEANT2 [14], Internet 2 [15], LONI [16] , [17] and Xsede\n[18] provide high-speed networking connectivity reaching\nup to 100Gbps to their users to mitigate the data bottleneck.\nUnfortunately, majority of the users fail to obtain even a\nfraction of the theoretical speeds promised by these networks\ndue to issues such as sub-optimal protocol tuning, inef?cient\nend-to-end routing disk and CPU performance bottlenecks\non the sending and receiving sites. Many different transfer\nprotocols have been developed [19], [20], [21], [22], [23],\n[24] in the transport and application layer to transfer data\nin large amounts in high speeds. GridFTP [24] is one of\nthe most advanced and highly adopted protocols that is\nused in high-speed networks to move around Big Data. A\nrate based protocol UDT[21] is an option in GridFTP as\nan alternative for the underlying TCP protocol. However\nUDT has problems ?lling the high-speed bandwidth in\nlocal or metropolitan area networks. Another UDP based\nprotocol UFTP[23] is designed to perform well for multicast\ntransfers. A very successful rate based protocol FASP used\nby Aspera[22] only compares itself to the traditional FTP\nprotocol and there is not a single study that compares it to the\nadvanced features for high-speed data transfers in GridFTP.\nAn important issue in Big Data transport is the dataset\ncharacteristics in addition to network and end-system bot-\ntlenecks. Unfortunately, there are very few studies that pay\n2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering\n978-0-7695-5096-1/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CSE.2013.155\n1067\nattention to that dimension 25]. Transferring large datasets\nthat consist of many small ?les causes many bottlenecks that\nare present e.g. transport protocol not reaching full network\nutilization due to short-duration transfers, connection start-\nup/tear down overhead e.g.protocol inef?ciency, end-system\nlimitations 


users and developers to overcome\nthese bottlenecks and increase the total throughput of their\ndata transfers This protocol is also an essential part of data\nschedulers that coordinates the data transfers in Grid and\nCloud environments [26], [27]. Three of the most powerful\nfunctions provided by GridFTP are pipelining parallelism\nand concurrency. With pipelining, a single control and data\nchannel is used for all the ?les and they are sent back-to-\nback without waiting the transfer complete command for\nthe previous transfer. With parallelism, different portions\nof the same ?le are sent through different data channels\nwhile in concurrency multiple ?les are sent through different\nchannels at the same time. Setting the optimal numbers\nfor these parameters is extremely hard. Unfortunately the\ncurrent GridFTP client globus-url-copy does not give the\n?exibility to change them dynamically for a single data set.\nHowever it is very important for data scheduling algorithms\nto be able to reorder, combine, divide these data sets\nand apply different parameter settings to ?nd the optimal\nscheduling.\nIn this study, we analyze the current needs of scalable\ndata scheduling algorithms and develop a client based on\nthe GridFTP client API. This new client allows the division,\nreordering, combining, enqueuing and dequeuing of dataset\ntransfers and is able to apply different pipelining, parallelism\nand concurrency settings to different parts of the dataset.\nAdaptive optimization-based scheduling algorithms are eas-\nily implemented and their performance improvements on\ntransfer throughput is measured. Two data scheduling algo-\nrithms are implemented by using the client API and tested on\nFuturegrid testbed [28]. Both algorithms dynamically alter\nGridFTP parameters and achieve performance improvements\nthat will not be gained otherwise without knowing the right\ncombination of parameter settings.\nII. RELATED WORK\nFile Transfer Scheduling problem dates back to 1980s.\nOne of the earliest works published in 1983 [29], proposes\nlist scheduling algorithms in which the transfers are ordered\nin a list from the largest task to the smallest one. This idea\nhas been used in many other algorithms with the addition\nof extra parameters to sort the transfers [30], [31], [32],\n[33]. Bandwidth of the path and size of the ?le are used\nto calculate how long a ?le transfer task will take. This\nordering usually gives a near-optimal solution while some\nother methods, such as integer programming, are applied\nto ?nd the optimal solution [34]. But they are not feasible\nsince the whole data transfer graph and the duration of the\ndata transfers are needed to be known before hand. Other\ntypes of scalable algorithms also exist in which, datasets\nare transferred from multiple replicas residing on different\nsources [34]. In some cases, these datasets are divided\nso that they can actually be sent over different paths to\nmake use of additional network bandwidth [35]. On other\ncases le transfers on the same path are grouped and sent\ntogether[9]. Adaptive algorithms exist [36], [37], where each\n?le is divided and transferred on multiple streams or multiple\n?le transfers are started at the same time by using con-\ncurrency and parallelism notions. The level of concurrency\nand parallelism is changed based on the current achieved\ntransfer throughput continuously. Optimization algorithms,\non the other hand, do not continuously change these numbers\nbut, by making use of small number of adaptive samplings,\napplies mathematical models to ?nd the optimal values of\nparallelism, pipelining and concurrency [38], [39]. Most of\nthe algorithms presented above are evaluated theoretically or\nimplemented speci?cally based on the needs of the algorithm\nby using protocols such as GridFTP.\nModern day Data Schedulers such as Globus Online[27]\nand Stork [26], queue data transfers and apply their own\nalgorithms to the ?le transfers. Both provides GridFTP\nprotocol as the baseline service for transfers. Globus Online\nprovides data management capabilities to users as hosted\nSoftware-as-a-Service \(SaaS thin clients over the\nInternet. However, it does not provide any optimization\ncapabilities. It sets pipelining, parallelism and concurrency\nstatically for three groups of datasets: average ?le size less\nthan 50MB, greater than 250MB and in between. Stork, on\nthe other hand, applies the optimization model in [38 for\nsingle ?le transfers and it is also possible to set a static\nconcurrency level to tasks submitted to the scheduler. Each\ntransfer task is started immediately based on this level. This\nconcurrency notion is different from GlobusOnline’s where,\na group of similar transfers are started at the same time.\nWe understand that by using different scheduling and\noptimization techniques, the data transfer throughput per-\nformance can be increased dramatically if an optimal or\nnear-optimal solution is found. From the methods described\nabove, a practical client API to implement data scheduling\nalgorithms should allow the dataset transfers to be:\nA enqueued, dequeued;\nB. sorted based on a property;\nC. divided, combined into chunks;\nD. grouped by source-destination paths;\nE. done from multiple replicas\nIII. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS\nOne of the most important setbacks in the current\nGridFTP client is that although it allows you to set\nparallelism and concurrency statically and sets its own\n1068\ndefault value for pipelining for a directory transfer which\nconsists of a large number of ?les, it does not allow you to\nchange it during the course of the transfer pp=pipelining,\np=parallelism, cc = concurrency 


source and destination url pairs could be given\nas a ?le list parameter, however the bene?ts of pipelining\ncan not be exploited as their developers indicate.\nglobus-url-copy -pp -p 5 -cc 4 -f ?lelist.txt\nThe client presented in this study, provides ?exible data\nstructures and functions designed to allow the developer\nto achieve the ?ve goals laid out in the previous section.\nThe main data structure is called ?????? ???? ? which is\ndesigned to hold the ?le information such as full source\nand destination paths, ?le name and ?le size.The le size\ninformation can be used in constructing data chunks based\non the total size, calculation of throughput and time it takes\nto complete the transfer based on the bandwidth information.\nThe source and destination paths are necessary in case of\ncombining and dividing the dataset as well as changing the\nsource based on the available replica locations. ?le name is\nused to reconstruct the full paths. This data structure is used\nwith list ?les function.\nFor a given source and destination url, the ???? ?????\nfunction contacts the GridFTP server, gathers the ?le names\nat the source url and ?lls the ?le list structure.When this\nfunction returns the information about all of the ?les at the\nsource url is constructed along with the number of ?les In\nthis way, it is possible to divide, combine, sort, enqueue,\ndequeue ?le transfers and alter their path informations.\nThe ??????? ???????? function is the most important\nfunction in this client which carries out the actual dataset\ntransfer with the optimization parameters. This function\nno longer operates on source and destination url of the\ndirectory like globes-url-copy does, but manipulates the ?le\nlist based on the given optimization parameters which set\npipelining, parallelism and concurrency levels. Based on the\nconcurrency level, different pipeline queues are set up and\ntheir parallelism levels are set and the transfers in each queue\nare carried out at the same time by a different handle\(which\ncorresponds to a GridFTP client structure that is responsible\nfor a connection each one of the queues.\nThe chunk size is the total size of the ?le array and used\nin calculation of the throughput value. With these basic\nfunctions, it is really easy to implement auxiliary functions\nthat manipulates the ?le list structure such as combining,\ndividing, sorting and altering. In the following section, we\nmake use of these abilities through different algorithms.\nIV. ALGORITHMS\nIn this section, two different algorithms are presented\nwhich are implemented by using the data structures and\nfunctions described in Section III. The ?rst algorithm is\na pure adaptive algorithm which dynamically changes the\nconcurrency level of the dataset transfer, while the second\none is a hybrid of adaptive as well as optimization algorithm\nbased on mathematical models.\nA. Adaptive Concurrency Algorithm\nThe adaptive algorithm takes a ?le list structure returned\nby list ?les and the number of ?les in a chunk as input.\nIt divides the ?le list into chunks each having the spec-\ni?ed number of ?les in a chunk parameter. Starting with\nconcurrency level of 1 performs the ?rst chunk transfer\nand keeps the returned throughput value. Then it increases\nthe concurrency level for the consequent chunk transfers as\nlong as the measured throughput for each chunk transfer is\ngreater than the previous one. If the throughput decreases the\nconcurrency level is decreased as well. In this way changing\nthe concurrency level based on the changes in the throughput\nallows to adapt network variations and also achieve better\nperformance by using concurrent transfers. Our client serves\nto the ability to divide dataset transfers into chunks and apply\nadaptively changing concurrency levels.\nAlgorithm 1 Adaptive CC\nRequire: ???? ?? ????? ? ?? ?? ????? ?? ? ????? ?\n????? ?????? ?? ?????\n??? 1\nwhile do\n??????? ????????\nif ???? ??? < ???? ???&?? >= 2 then\n??? ??/2\nelse\n??? ??× 2\nend if\nend while=0\nB PP-CC-P-Optimization Algorithm\nThe second algorithm targets to ?nd the optimal values\nof pipelining concurrency and parallelism, ?rst through\nminimal samplings, then transfers the rest of the dataset with\nthese values. According to Yildirim et al [39] , pipelining\nis good for ?le transfers of which sizes are less than\nthe Bandwidth-Delay Product\(BDP pipelining\nlevel for the small ?les is approximately:\n????? ? ???/???? ???? ????+ 1 \(1 static value of ?? = 2 is enough.\nConsidering the dataset at hand, consists of ?les smaller than\n1069\nAlgorithm 2 Optimal PP\nRequire: ???? ?? ????? ? ????? ????? ? ??? ????? ?\n n?????? ?? ???? ??\nCalculate ???? ???? ????\nCalculate ??????? ??? ??\nCalculate nif ??????? ??? ??! = 1&\n??????? ??? ?? ?= ?????? ?? &\n??????? ??? ?? <= ??? ?? &\n n???? ???? ???? ????? > ????? ?????&\n???? ???? ???? ????? < ??? ?????&\n??????? ????? ???? > 2 then\ncall ??????? ?? ???????? ??? ????? ?? ???? ?????\n n\(???? ?????+ 1 different pipelining levels to different groups\nof chunks with different mean ?le sizes is a promising\nsolution to increase performance. To divide the dataset\ninto chunks and assign optimal pipelining levels to each\nchunk, a recursive division algorithm is applied\(Algorithm\n2 recursively until the optimal\npipelining level for the parent chunk becomes equal to the\ndivided chunk. There 


are also other stopping conditions.\nFirst, a chunk can not be less than the minimum chunk\nsize provided. This ensures that chunks do not become\nvery small because larger chunks tend to achieve better\nthroughput. Also not to overwhelm the GridFTP server\nwith back-to-back transfer requests a maximum pipelining\nlevel is given and any pipelining value calculated can not\nbe greater than this value. When the chunks are divided\nand optimal pipelining values are assigned, an adaptive\nconcurrency scheme is applied to each chunk. During the\ncourse of the transfers further division/combination actions\nmight be taken.\nThe next algorithm\(Algorithm 3 algorithm takes ?le list, number of\n?les, min chunk size, BDP and min number of chunks as\ninput. The ?rst step sorts the ?les in ascending order based\non their sizes. Then OPTIMAL PP algorithm is applied and\nthe ?le list is recursively divided with each chunk being\nassigned their pp values. If the number of created chunks\nis less than min number of chunks parameter, the largest\nchunk is divided until there are enough available chunks\nto apply an adaptive concurrency strategy. Each chunk is\ntransferred by setting its optimal pipelining and current\nAlgorithm 3 Optimal CC\nRequire: ???? ?? ????? ? ????? ?????? ?? ????? ?\n nSort the ?les\nCreate chunks by applying OPTIMAL PP algorithm\nwhile Number of chunks is less than min chunk no do\nDivide largest chunk\nend while\n???? ??? 1\n???? ??? ? 0\nperform transfer for the ?rst chunk\nwhile current throughtput greater than previous through-\nput do\nperform transfer for the consequent chunk\n 2\nend while\nopt cc = prev cc\nCombine chunks with same pp values\nperform transfer for the rest of the chunks with optimal\npp and cc\n=0\nconcurrency value and the subsequent chunks are transferred\nby exponentially increasing the concurrency values until the\nmeasured throughput starts to drop down. In this case the\nprevious concurrency level is chosen as optimal and the rest\nof the chunks are transferred with this value. However before\nthat, if chunks with same pp values exist, they are combined\nso that chunk transfers with same pp and cc values will not\nbe conducted separately. This algorithm realizes several of\nthe goals mentioned in Section II such as sorting, dividing,\ncombining datasets.\nFor datasets with ?le sizes greater than BDP, a similar\nalgorithm is applied to add parallelism. In this case optimal\npipelining level is set to 2 statically and a new chunk\nis created with a precalculated minimum chunk size. The\nparallelism level is increased ?rst as in Algorithm 3 and\nafter ?nding the optimal parallelism value, the concurrency\nvalue is increased adaptively until an optimal value is found.\nThe rest of the dataset is transferred by setting these optimal\nvalues.\nV. EXPERIMENTS\nThe implemented algorithms with the introduced ?exible\nclient are tested in Futuregrid [28] Testbed between two\nclusters called Sierra and Hotel. This testbed has a wide-area\nhigh-speed 1Gbps network and the delay between the two\nclusters is around 80ms. The theoretical speed for transfer-\nring a large ?le that is able to ?ll the network pipe is around\n800-900Mbps. However it is not possible to say the upper\ntheoretical limit for a set of small ?les because it changes\nbased on the characteristics of the dataset.

There\nare two different cases in terms of the characteristics of\nthe dataset. In the ?rst case, 4000 1MB ?les are generated\nwhile in the second, the dataset is constructed of 4000\nrandom-size ?les. The maximum ?le size for this case is\n2MB and the ?les are uniformly distributed resulting in a\nmean of 1MB ?le size. Small ?le sizes are chosen because\npipelining and concurrency are most useful for these types\nof transfers which are in the form of large number of\nsmall ?les. Most of the problems do not occur for large\n?le transfers. We compare the algorithms’ throughput to\nthe baseline GridFTP throughput with data channel caching\nand the default pipelining level set. We also implemented\nan optimized UDT client/server similar to GridFTP data\nchannel caching for transferring large number of small ?les\nin which a single connection is opened and the ?les are\nsent back-to-back using the same channel. The results are\npresented for both cases in Figures 1 and 2.\nAccording to Figure 1, the Adaptive-CC algorithm tested\nwith different chunk sizes in the range of [250-500-1000]\n?les, results in increased concurrency levels for larger chunk\nsizes and higher throughput values, while for smaller chunks\nthe concurrency level becomes stable around 16-32 resulting\nin lower throughput values\(1.a and b all of the cases a\nperformance improvement can be observed comparing to\nthe baseline GridFTP. The 500- and 


1000-?le-chunk cases\npasses the performance of the optimized UDT. For the\nOptimization algorithm \(1.c and d the x-axis represents\npipelining\(pp p cc The optimal pipelining value\nis set as 4 and the concurrency level is increased as the\nthroughput continues to increase with it. The maximum\nthroughput achieved is around 800Mbps and it eventually\npasses the optimized UDT performance when it ?nds the\noptimal settings. The chunks are recursively divided into\nequal lengths. The performance is increased with adaptively\nchanging throughput values.\nFor the second case\(Figure 2 le sizes are\ngenerated randomly, the throughput results are more unstable\nand lower comparing to the ?rst case. The highest through-\nput achieved is around 500Mbps. For the adaptive-CC algo-\nrithm, concurrency levels are elevated but the throughput\ndifferences are less signi?cant \(Figure 2.a baseline GridFTP is outperformed\nin most chunk transfers and some of the 250-?le-chunks\noutperforms the optimized UDT results. For the optimiza-\ntion algorithm, since the mean ?le size value is less than\nBDP chunks are recursively divided and different optimal\npipelining levels are assigned to each chunk\(Figure 2.c and\nd bigger size ?les\ntends to have smaller pipelining values resulting in no further\ndivision GridFTP is outperformed much more\nquickly than optimized UDT but the optimal case is more\nsuccessful than both UDT and baseline GridFTP.\nThe highest throughput achieved by the algorithms may\nchange depending on the characteristics of the dataset\(e.g.\n1071\n 50 100\n 200\n 300\n 400\n 500\n 600\n 700\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nM\nbp\ns\nchunk #\na files-in-a-chunk\n500 files-in-a-chunk\n1000 files-in-a-chunk\n 1 2 4\n 8\n 16\n 32\n 64\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nCC\nchunk #\nb files-in-a-chunk\n 2e+08\n 4e+08\n 6e+08\n 8e+08\n 1e+09\n11-0-1\n8-0-2\n5-0-4\n4-0-8\n3-0-16\nBy\nte\ns\npp-p-cc\nc Optimal Algorithm Chunksize\nChunksize\n 200\n 400\n 600\n 800\n11-0-1\n8-0-2\n5-0-4\n4-0-8\n3-0-16\nM\nbp\ns\npp-p-cc\nd PP-CC-P Optimal Algorithm Throughput\nGridFTP fast pp baseline\nOptimized UDT\nThroughput\nFigure 2. 4000 randomly generated ?les [size range 1Byte-2MB]\n?le size and chunk size improvement is observed in all of the cases. The\nprotocol bottlenecks are eliminated for large number of small\n?le transfers and the optimization algorithm performs better\nthan all of the cases at its optimal settings. The algorithms\nare easily implemented due to the ?exibility of proposed\nclient functionality. The variety of the algorithms can be\nextended and would be just as easy to implement as well.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nA exible GridFTP client is implemented which has the\nability to comply with different-natured data scheduling\nalgorithms designed to move around Big Data. The new\nclient can overcome the lacks of the current GridFTP\nclient and allows easy implementation of various kinds of\nalgorithms by allowing optimized values set for pipelining,\nparallelism and concurrency. The adaptive and optimization\nalgorithms implemented with the new client sorts, divides\nand combines datasets easily and improves the achieved\nthroughput. The current structures and functions of the client\nallows enqueuing and dequeuing of dataset transfers and\nalteration of source and destination paths. As future work\nthese auxiliary functions will be implemented in a generic\nway and to be able to download from multiple replicas at\nthe same, the GridFTP client API will be altered so that it\nis thread-safe. Reusing the open connections is also another\nfuture goal to reduce the overhead of the client.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis material is based upon work supported in part by the\nNational Science Foundation under Grant No. 0910812 to\nIndiana University for ”FutureGrid: An Experimental, High-\nPerformance Grid Test-bed.” Partners in the FutureGrid\nproject include U.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
