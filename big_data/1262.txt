Mining Dynamic Interdimension Association Rules for Local-scale Weather Prediction Zhongnan Zhang Weili Wu Yaochun Huang University of Texas at Dallas P.O. Box 830688; MS EC31 Richardson, TX 75083-0688 zxz022000, weiliwu, yxh038100  @utdallas.edu Abstract Mining dynamic interdimension association rules for local-scale weather prediction is to discover abnormal weather phenomena changing so that the professional weather forecaster can use these rules to predict some severe weather situations, such as hail storm, thunder storm and so on. A weather analysis is composed of individual analyses of the several meteorological variables When some of meteorological variables have some special change tendency, some kind of severe weather will happen in most cases. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, DIAL to discover potential relations between the special change tendency and the severe weather. The algorithm consists three parts: \(1 nal static database recording the weather condition data into a new database with the changing tendency of every measurements of the weather; \(2 dimensional association rules from the new generated database; \(3 terval rules into the dynamic interdimension association rules 1. Introduction Data mining was ?rst introduced within the business world. However much of the work on Data Mining is that most, if not all, of this work is just as applicable to the scienti?c environment, such as astronomy, biology, bionomics, geography, genetics, medicine, meteorology, and so on [7, 5, 4, 8, 10, 16, 11].We present in this paper our efforts of introducing temporal association rules mining into one of the most important applications of meteorology, weather prediction Support in part by the National Science Foundation under grant ACI0305567 Severe weather is any type of violent or extreme weather event that represents a hazard to public safety and welfare [9]. Modern data assimilation requires two sets of in 


formation to generate an estimated analysis of the current state of the atmosphere: \(1 servations and \(2 the atmosphere valid at the time of the observations, known as the background. The new observations are used to adjust or update the background in a manner designed to produce a minimum-error analysis. The problem of the discovery of temporal association rules comes from the need to discover patterns in transaction data in a supermarket [2]. We ?nd that some special meteorological variables’ changing has tight relation with some severe weather situation that will happen very soon. Since the data of everyday weather condition are so huge that many relations can not be found easily only by directly observation. Using the discovery of association rules, we can scan a large amount of the weather record to ?nd more relation pairs hidden behind The organization of the rest paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present the related works and our contribution The problem de?nition is formally given in Section 3. In Section 4, we propose an algorithm for mining temporal association rules on the pre-processed data. We present our experience with the algorithm on a real-life dataset in Section 5. Finally, we discuss the related future work and conclude with summary 2. Related Works and Our Contribution 2.1. Related Works Many other researchers have tried to using some other data mining technologies in areas related to weather prediction or global climate changing. The emphasis in [11] is on using K-means clustering to divide the land and ocean areas of the earth into disjoint regions in an automatic so that Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference \(COMPSAC’04 0730-3157/04 $20.00 © 2004 IEEE enables the direct or indirect discovery of interesting patterns In [13] the probabilityof weather prediction is discussed The predictability of weather and climate forecasts is determined by the projection of uncertainties in both initial conditions and model formulation From [6], we can get that water in its various phases plays a critical role in the climate system. Evaporation of water from the surface keeps the average surface temperature far cooler than it would otherwise be, but water vapor is also the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and condensed water in the form of clouds is also an important absorber of longwave radiation. On the other hand much of the earth’s albedo is owing to clouds The ?rst explicit analysis of the weather prediction problem from a scienti?c viewpointwas undertaken at the begin 


ning of the last century [12], when the Norwegian scientist VilhelmBjerknes set down a two-step plan for rational forecasting The necessary and suf?cient conditions for the rational solution of forecasting problems are the following 1. A suf?ciently accurate knowledge of the state of the atmosphere at the initial time 2. A suf?ciently accurate knowledge of the laws according to which one state of the atmosphere develops from another 2.2. Our Contribution In this paper, we propose a new framework to discover dynamic interdimension association rules for local-scale weather prediction. This framework consists of a formal model de?nition and a three-phase algorithm for discovery. We modify the classical association rules model with adding some constrains so that it becomes feasible for mining interdimension relations from the weather record data We also propose a new algorithm, DIAL, incorporating the algorithm for quantitative association rules mining and the process of database transformation.Using this algorithmwe can get the potential rules for local-scale weather prediction 3. Formal Model In this section, we propose the formal model de?nition for dynamic intermension association rules discovery. In addition, some speci?cations on the parameters selection are also clari?ed in this section 3.1. Problem Formulation This problem is generated from the requirement of localscale weather prediction. It captures the essential properties of the measurements of weather condition so that the later proposed algorithm which uses this formulation will provide practically useful rules. The problem is formally de?ned as follows Given A set of multi-value attributes  A database of the weather condition record D The minimum support factor minsup The minimum con?dence factor minconf Find: Dynamic interdimension association rules   and con?dence fac   Objective: Maximize the support factor and the con 


dence factor according to the correspondent rule Constraints 1. Each attribute corresponds to a meteorological variable, such as temperature, pressure, dew point wind, clouds, visibility, condition and so on 2. The last attribute   as the attribute corresponding to the meteorological variable condition 3.  is a set of predictions according to the attributes in set  except 4. Every attribute appears at most once in the prediction set 5. The support factor should be greater than or equal to the given minsup 6. The con?dence factor should be greater than or equal to the given minconf The following rule is an example of dynamic association rule decrease\(Temperature,5 Pressure,0.6 shower[s=3%, c=30 3.2. Parameter Speci?cation In above formulation, the problem of rule mining has the following issues which are needed to be clari?ed 1 tion rules are: increase, decrease, equal and direction-range Two-digit numbers are used to report wind direction to the nearest tens of degrees. Thus, 02 represents 20 ? , 18 is 180 and 32 is 320 ? . North is always taken as 360 ? and is reported as 36 2 perfect”, at least in the general features, and the 72-hour forecasts of today are as accurate as 36-hour forecasts were just ten to twenty years ago [15]. To make our discovery more useful, the moderate range of the record used to discover should be within 36-hour Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference \(COMPSAC’04 0730-3157/04 $20.00 © 2004 IEEE Different sever weather situationwill need different time period for forecasting. The sever situations with high speed generation process, such as thunderstorms, need shorter observation period. Others may need a little longer period once per day or twice per day 3 speci?c seasons. For example, hurricanes often happen in the South of America in summer and blizzards concentrate in the Midwest of America in winter and spring and scarcely happen in other seasons. We will use different con 


straint values for those situations depending more on seasons within the process of discovery 4. Dynamic Interdimension Association rules for Local-scale weather prediction \(DIAL Algorithm In general, the DIAL algorithm consists of the following three phases 1. Phase I: Database Transformation 2. Phase II: Generating the Quantitative Association Rules 3. Phase III: Generating the Dynamic Interdimension Association Rules 4.1. Phase I: Database Transformation The original database  storing the observation data needs to be transformed into a new database   storing the change of each attributes according to the situation. The database   has the same attributes as the database  . The method for generating new tuples is described as follows 1. from    =2 for all tuples in the database 2. for every attributes   in this tuple     do 3. if Name 4  5. else if   = Null 6 Null 7. else if     Null 8 compare         


9. else 10 Null 11. add into   12. endfor 13. add   into 14. endfor 4.2. Phase II: Generating the Quantitative Association Rules After generating the new database   describing the change of each attribute, we try to discovery the frequent itemsets. Much of the data in   are continuous but not discrete. Therefore, we cannot use ordinary method [3 such as Apriori algorithm, to generate frequent itemsets. We should use the algorithm mentioned in [14] to generate the rules. The following issues should be clari?ed before using the algorithm 1 ments of the weather need different partition rules. Following is the detail of the rule Temperature: The partition of temperature difference would be  \(-  , -20 0 0, 5], \(5, 10], \(10, 15], \(15 Humidity: The partition of humidity difference is the same as that of temperature Dew Point: Dew point is related to temperature. Therefore they are using the same partition Wind Speed: The partition of wind-speed difference is as follows:  \(-  , -40 0 0, 5], \(5, 10], \(10, 20], \(20, 40], \(40 Wind Direction: The partition of wind-direction is as follows:  \(0,6], \(6, 12], \(12, 18], \(18, 24], \(24, 30], \(30 36 Pressure: Its partition is:  \(-  , -0.8 0.4  0.2, 0.4], \(0.4, 0.6 0.6, 0.8], \(0.8 Visibility: Its partition is:  \(-  , -4 2, -1  1, 2], \(2, 3], \(3, 4], \(4 Precipitation:Use the same partition as that of pressure 2 


tion should be set in proportion to the appearance probability within a whole year 4.3. Phase III: Generating the Dynamic Interdimension Association Rules After Phase II, we discover some quantitative association rules. At this time we introduce our prede?ned predicates into these rules to generate the dynamic interdimension association rules. Since many of the items consisting of the rules are ranges, we can either still use this range or the mean value of the range to express those items. The rules generated include the associations of all of the weather condition, not only those severe conditions. The ?nal phase of this algorithm needs more interaction between the algorithm and the end-user so that the discovery may get a much better result 5. Experience with a real-life dataset We assessed the correctness and effectiveness of our algorithm by experimenting with a real-life dataset. The data were weather record data of Dallas City from April 2002 to June 2002 [1]. The data had ten attributes which include Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference \(COMPSAC’04 0730-3157/04 $20.00 © 2004 IEEE eight quantitative attributes and two categorical attributes There were 1092 records in the dataset 5.1. Experiment Design The datasets getting from Weather Underground and NCDC are raw data.The most distinct weather changes which happen in all spring and the early summer according to Dallas City. Therefore choosing this part of data can clearly re?ect the relation between the meteorological variables and the weather conditions. The ?rst step of our experiment is to rearrange the dataset. The ?rst phase of our algorithm is to build a new database re?ecting the changing tendency of the meteorological variables. After this phase determing the number of partitions for each quantitative attribute and how to partition should be accomplished. In the second phase of our algorithm, we use the algorithm in [14 to generate the frequent itemsets. The algorithm used to generate association rules is different to the traditional algorithm in [3]. In our algorithm we only generate rule whose right-hand-side only contains the DYSW attribute. The ?nal phase will use our prede?ned predicates to generate the dynamic interdimension association rules 5.2. Result Evaluation Evaluating the usefulness of the results from running our algorithm need some special review. However, some rules we get are pretty straightforward. The following rule is generated when we set minsup to 8% and minconf to 20 direction range \(RDIR, 12..18 DPTP, 0..5 


Thunder-Storm [ s = 8%, c = 20 Dallas City is located near Gulf of Mexico which is located in the southeast of the city. When the warm air?ow moves toward northwest, it is moisture-conditioned. After its landing, it will meet some cold air?ow existing in the land. If the warm air?ow is stronger than the cold one, it can still go north and push the cold one back. Along this way, there will be a plenty of precipitation. Now looks back to the geographical position of Dallas City. It’s just on the way of the warm air?ow and the distance between the city and the coast is also not very far. That is why the warm air?ow can bring much precipitation to this city from southeast. When warm air?ow comes, the relative humility will increase which will make the dew point increase 6. Conclusions In this paper, we introduce the problem of mining dynamic interdimension association rules for local-scale severe weather prediction. We ?rst transform the original weather record database into a new database expressing the change tendencies of the measurements of the weather Then we use the algorithm for mining quantitative association rules to generate the result rules in quantitative format Finally, we introduce some predicates to generate the ?nal rules In this paper, we focus on the time-related measurements of weather. In the future, we will incorporate the spacerelated measurements for weather prediction. In addition we will improve our model so that it will ?t for a regional even global weather prediction References 1] Daily surface data. US and some non-US format Documentation, 2002 2] R.

variable names mapped by the where keyword to the relation in DataSchema and pv are variable names that appear in the StructureSchema At instantiation time pv is assigned values of the Structure component and dv is mapped to the relation appearing in Data component. The de?nition for the pattern well-formed formula is now straightforward De?nition 14 A pattern formula is of the form fp\(dv 2 where fp \(formula predicate variablesmapped by thewhere keyword to the relation appearing in Data component From the previous de?nitions the semantics of the where keyword become evident: we impose that the variables of the formula will take values from speci?c relations when the formula predicate is employed in queries Example 2 Let us consider the following formulas 1. f\(x x 2. f\(g\(x x In the ?rst formula variable x is mapped to R using the where keyword, thus the formula is well formed. Keep in mind that the formula predicate by itself is just the part f\(x is not well-formed since y is not mapped via where to any relation, or otherwise range restricted 5. Querying the Pattern Warehouse We de?ne queries to be posed over the pattern warehouse and not individually over its data- or patternbase components. Through this approach, we are able to sustain queries traversing from the pattern to the data space and vice-versa. At the same time, the consistency of the results is guaranteed by the pattern-data mapping De?nition 15 Let PW the set of all possible Pattern Warehouses. A query is a function with signature PW ? PW. Given a query q and a pattern warehouse pw = \(DB,PB D?B, P?B q\(pw DB?, PB   P?B? = ?[D?1, ..., D?m], [P?C1:PT1]?. We assume that tr, tp\(tr ? R1 ? tp ? PC1 tr, tp Note that, similarly to the relational case, the result of a query is always a pattern warehouse containing just one relation and one pattern class. It is also important to point out that, in practice, even if a query always involve both the data and pattern space, operations over patterns are executed in isolation, locally at the PBMS. The reference to the underlying data is activated only on-demand \(whenever the user speci?cally requests so stored intermediate mappings or the formula approximation 5.1. Query operators In this section we introduce query operators that allow basic queries over the the PW . Assuming that DB denotes the set of all possible database instances and PB the set of all possible pattern bases, we consider the following groups of operators  Database operators: they can be applied locally to the DBMS. op : DB ? DB. We denote the set of database operators with OD  Pattern base operators: they can be applied locally to the PBMS. op : PB ? PB. We denote the set of database operators with OP  Cross-over database operators: they involve evaluation on both the DBMS and the PBMS, the result is a database. op : DB  PB ? DB. We denote the set of database operators with OCD  Cross-over pattern base operators: they involve evaluation on both the DBMS and the PBMS, the 


evaluation on both the DBMS and the PBMS, the result is a pattern base. op : DB  PB ? PB. We denote the set of database operators with OCP In the following, we present examples of the last three classes of operators \(database operators coincide with usual relational operators operators, we introduce some examples of predicates de?ned over patterns Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE 5.1.1. Pattern predicates We identify two main classes of atomic predicates: predicates over patterns and predicates over pattern components. From those atomic predicates we can then construct complex predicates. In the following, we denote pattern components by using the dot notation. For example, the measure component of a pattern p is denoted by p.Measure Predicates over pattern components. They check properties of speci?c pattern components. Let p1 and p2 be two patterns, possibly selected by some queries. The general form of a predicate over pattern components is t1?t2, where t1 and t2 are path expressions that must de?ne components of patterns p1 and p2, of compatible type and ? must be an operator, de?ned for the type of t1 and t2. For example, if t1 and t2 are integer expressions, then ? can be a disequality operator e.g. one of &lt;,&gt cases  If t1 and t2 are pattern data for patterns p1 and p2, then ? ? {=,?}. t1 = t2 is true if and only if x x ?? p1 ? x ?? p2 and t1 ? t2 is true if and only if ?x x ?? p1 ? x ?? p2  If t1 and t2 are pattern formulas for patterns p1 a n d  p 2   t h e n             t 1    t 2  i s  t r u e  i f  a n d o n l y  i f  t 1    t 2  a n d  t 1    t 2  i s  t r u e  i f  a n d  o n l y  i f  t 1 logically implies t2 Predicates over patterns. We consider the following set of predicates  Identity if they have the same PID, i.e. p1.P ID = p2.P ID  Shallow equality \(=s are shallow equal if their corresponding components \(except for the PID component i.e. p1.Structure = p2.Structure, p1.Source p2.Source, p1.Measure = p2.Measure, and p1.formula = p2.formula. Note that, to check the equality for each component pair, the basic equality operator for the speci?c component type is used  Deep equality \(=d deep equal if their corresponding data are identical, i.e., ?x x ?? p1 ? x ?? p2   S u b s u m p t i o n       A  p a t t e r n  p 1  s u b s u m e s  a  p a t t e r n  p 2   p 1    p 2   i f  t h e y  h a v e  t h e  s a m e  s t r u c ture but p2 represents a smaller set of raw data i.e. p1.Structure = p2.Structure, p1.Source p 2  S o u r c e  a n d  p 1  f o r m u l a    p 2  f o r m u l a  Complex predicates. They are de?ned by applying usual logical connectives to atomic predicates. Thus, if F1 and F2 are predicates, then F1 ? F2,F1 ? F2  F1 are predicates. We make a closed world assumption, thus the calculation of  F is always ?nite 5.1.2. Pattern base operators OP In this subsection, we introduce several operators de?ned over patterns. Some of them, like set-based operators, renaming and selection are quite close to their relational counterparts; nevertheless, some others, like join and projection have signi?cant di?erences Set-based operators. Since classes are sets, usual operators such as union, di?erence and intersection are de 


tors such as union, di?erence and intersection are de?ned for pairs of classes of the same pattern type Renaming. Similarly to the relational context, we consider a renaming operator ? that takes a class and a renaming function and changes the names of the pattern attributes according to the speci?ed function Projection. The projection operator allows one to reduce the structure and the measures of the input patterns by projecting out some components. The new expression is obtained by projecting the formula de?ning the expression over the remaining attributes [12 Note that no projection is de?ned over the data source since in this case the structure and the measures would have to be recomputed Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let ls be a non empty list of attributes appearing in pt.Structure and lm a list of attributes appearing in pt.Measure. Then the projection operator is de?ned as follows ls,lm c id s m f p ? c, p = \(pid, s, d,m, f In the previous de?nition, id ing new pids for patterns, ?mlm\(m projection of the measure component and ?sls\(s ned as follows: \(i s usual relational projection; \(ii sls\(s and removing the rest from set elements. The last component ?ls?lm\(f computed in certain cases, when the theory over which the formula is constructed admits projection. This happens for example for the polynomial constraint theory 12 Selection. The selection operator allows one to select the patterns belonging to one class that satisfy a certain predicate, involving any possible pattern component, chosen among the ones presented in Section 5.1.1 Let c be a class of pattern type pt. Let pr be a predicate. Then, the selection operator is de?ned as follows pr\(c p Join. The join operation provides a way to combine patterns belonging to two di?erent classes according to a join predicate and a composition function speci?ed by the user Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Let c1 and c2 be two classes over two pattern types pt1 and pt2. A join predicate F is any predicate de?ned over a component of patterns in c1 and a component of patterns in c2. A composition function c pattern types pt1 and pt2 is a 4-tuple of functions c cStructureSchema, cDataSchema, cMeasureSchema, cFormula one for each pattern component. For example, function cStructureSchema takes as input two structure values of the right type and returns a new structure value, for a possible new pattern type, generated by the join. Functions for the other pattern components are similarly de?ned. Given two patterns p1 = \(pid1, s1, d1,m1, f1 p2 = \(pid2, s2, d2,m2, f2 p1, p2 ned as the pattern p with the following components Structure : cStructureSchema\(s1, s2 Data : cDataSchema\(d1, d2 Measure : cMeasureSchema\(m1,m2 Formula : cformula\(f1, f2 The join of c1 and c2 with respect to the join predicate F and the composition function c, denoted by c 1   F  c  c 2   i s  n o w  d e  n e d  a s  f o l l o w s    F  c  c 2     c  p 1   p 2   p 1    c 1  p 2    c 2  F   p 1   p 2     t r u e   5.1.3. Cross-over database operators OCD Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to 


Drill-Through. The drill-through operator allows one to navigate from the pattern layer to the raw data layer Thus it takes as input a pattern class and it returns a raw data set. More formally, let c be a class of pattern type pt and let d be an instance of the data schema ds of pt. Then, the drill-through operator is denoted by c c Data-covering. Given a pattern p and a dataset D sometimes it is important to determine whether the pattern represents it or not. In other words, we wish to determine the subset S of D represented by p \(p can also be selected by some query the formula as a query on the dataset. Let p be a pattern, possibly selected by using query language operators, and D a dataset with schema \(a1, ..., an ible with the source schema of p. The data-covering operator, denoted by ?d\(p,D responding to all tuples in D represented by p. More formally d\(p,D t.a1, ..., t.an In the previous expression, t.ai denotes a speci?c component of tuple t belonging to D and p.formula\(t.a1, ..., t.an instantiated by replacing each variable corresponding to a pattern data component with values of the considered tuple t Note that, since the drill-though operator uses the intermediate mapping and the data covering operator uses the formula, the covering ?\(p,D D = ?\(p not be equal to D. This is due to the approximating nature of the pattern formula 5.1.4. Cross-over pattern base operators OCP Pattern-covering. Sometimes it can be useful to have an operator that, given a class of patterns and a dataset, returns all patterns in the class representing that dataset \(a sort of inverse data-covering operation Let c be a pattern class and D a dataset with schema a1, ..., an pattern type. The pattern-covering operator, denoted as ?p\(c,D all patterns in c representing D. More formally p\(c,D t.a1, ..., t.an true Note that: ?p\(c,D p,D 6. Related Work Although signi?cant e?ort has been invested in extending database models to deal with patterns, no coherent approach has been proposed and convincingly implemented for a generic model There exist several standardization e?orts for modeling patterns, like the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  eling approach, the ISO SQL/MM standard [2], which is SQL-based, and the Common Warehouse Model CWM  ing e?ort. Also, the Java Data Mining API \(JDMAPI 3] addresses the need for a language-based management of patterns. Although these approaches try to represent a wide range of data mining result, the theoretical background of these frameworks is not clear. Most importantly, though, they do not provide a generic model capable of handling arbitrary cases of pattern types; on the contrary only a given list of prede?ned pattern types is supported To our knowledge, research has not dealt with the issue of pattern management per se, but, at best, with peripheral proximate problems. For example, the paper by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement 


per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
