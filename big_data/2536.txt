Today, we have BigData, big graphs, big matrices, and in the\nfuture, they are expected to be bigger and more complex. Many\nof today’s algorithms will be, and some already are, expensive\nto run on large datasets. In this work, we analyze a set of\nef?cient techniques to make “big data”, which is modeled as a\nhypergraph, smaller so that its processing takes much less time.\nAs an application use case, we take the hypergraph partitioning\nproblem, which has been successfully used in many practical\napplications for various purposes including parallelization of\ncomplex and irregular applications, sparse matrix ordering clus-\ntering, community detection, query optimization, and improving\ncache locality in shared-memory systems We conduct several\nexperiments to show that our techniques greatly reduce the\ncost of the partitioning process and preserve the partitioning\nquality.

INTRODUCTION\nUsing and analyzing large data for practical purposes has\nalways been a fundamental problem. But today, the data\none needs to cope with for a major scienti?c innovation or\ndiscovery is immense, distributed, and unstructured. Although\nrecent advancements on computer hardware and storage tech-\nnologies allow us to gather and store large-scale data, the data\nitself does not serve science and society. In addition to its\nsize, utilizing this data and ?nding meaningful patterns inside\nit require complex algorithms and an immense amount of\ncomputing power. Hence, techniques to make the data smaller\nare always appreciated.\nHypergraphs emerged as a good alternative model for un-\nstructured data for many applications such as parallelization\nof complex and irregular applications from various domains\nincluding parallel scienti?c computing [1], sparse matrix\nreordering [2], social network analysis [3], clustering and\nrecommendation [4], and database design [5], [6], [7]. In\nmany of these applications, once the problem is modeled as\na hypergraph, the optimization problem in hand reduces to,\nsometimes with little variations, the hypergraph partitioning\nproblem. Due to its wide area of applications, a considerable\neffort has been put into providing tool support for hypergraph\npartitioning \(see hMeTiS [8], MLpart [9], Mondriaan [10],\nParkway [11], PaToH [12], UMPa [13] and Zoltan [14 main criteria to evaluate the performance of\na tool: the quality of the partition with respect to a partitioning\nmetric and the time required to partition the given hypergraph.\nIt has been repeatedly shown that minimizing the partitioning\nmetrics in the literature can signi?cantly increase the perfor-\nmance for many computations. However, the relative impor-\ntance of these criteria change with respect to the application If\nthe partitioning time is bigger than the gain in the computation\ntime, it may be better to trade quality for partitioning cost. But\none needs to be careful with this trade-off since worsening\nthe quality can also worsen the performance. For example, in\na recent study, Akbudak et al. studied different partitioning\nmodels to optimize the cache locality for the sparse-matrix\nvector multiplication kernel \(SpMV  that\nwhen the 1D hypergraph model in [16] is used, the partitioning\noverhead is amortized in 286 SpMV operations. For their 2D\nmodel, this number is 1110 but the SpMV performance is\n13% better than the 1D case at the same time. Hence, the best\nmodel, or even the decision of using a partitioning depends\non the subsequent computation. Clearly, if the partitioning\nprocess is made faster it will be much more useful for many\napplications.\nIn the past, powerful parallel machines were only accessible\nby a small set of researchers Today, a High Performance\nComputing \(HPC commodity. However, when the\nnumber of processors increases to tens of thousands, which\nis the case today, the data and task distribution cost via\npartitioning also increases. Yet the communication between\nprocessors and hence the quality of the partition become more\nimportant with the increasing size of the systems Hence,\nreducing the partitioning cost, especially for a larger system,\nis a crucial task.\nIn this work, we investigate hypergraph sparsi?cation to\nreduce the partitioning cost. At the high level, we model the\nsparsi?cation problem as ?nding the sets of identical \(or very\nsimilar hypergraph. Let S be such a\nset containing distinct elements with identical connectivity\ninformation. Hence the same information is duplicated |S|\n2013 42nd International Conference on Parallel Processing\n0190-3918/13 26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/ICPP.2013.29\n200\ntimes in the hypergraph. Duplicate information causes two\nmain problems for a task: First, the same information is\nprocessed several times, and this redundancy usually worsens\nthe ef?ciency of the task. Second, if the purpose of this\ntask is optimization, the redundant \(or 


almost redundant or\noptimal action we take to remove such\ninformation is using a single representative instead of all the\nelements in S The representative can be either an existing\nelement of S or can be arti?cially created according to a\ncriterion by using the properties of S’s elements.\nIn particular, here we investigate cheap hypergraph sparsi-\n?cation heuristics: identical-net, identical-vertex, and similar-\nnet removal. Although identical-net removal has been used in\npartitioning before [12], [17], to the best of our knowledge,\nthere is no work which analyzes its effectiveness in detail.\nEven though, some implementations exist in widely-used\npartitioning tools such has PaToH and Zoltan, it is disabled in\nPaToH, since on average, the existing code does not amortize\nitself in PaToH’s recursive bisection framework, and we show\nthat Zoltan’s sort based approach can be improved. Hence,\nthe algorithms designed and analyzed in this work can be\nused in other tools, including PaToH and Zoltan, for faster\npartitioning. Furthermore, there is no previous work which\nanalyzes the effectiveness of the similarity-based sparsi?cation\ntechniques we propose in this paper for hypergraph based data.\nWe carefully design a set of experiments to analyze the\neffectiveness of the proposed sparsi?cation techniques their\nintegration to the multi-level approach, and their ef?cient\nimplementation. For the experiments, we use a multi-level K-\nway partitioning tool UMPa \(pronounced as “Oompa  volume which is the\nclassical partitioning objective used in practice. Our exper-\niments show that when the hypergraphs in the multi-level\nframework are sparsi?ed, one can obtain partitions with similar\nquality in signi?cantly less time.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II\ngives the notation and background for hypergraph partitioning,\nand Section III describes the proposed sparsi?cation heuristics.\nThe experimental results are presented in Section IV. Sec-\ntion V concludes the paper.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA Hypergraph partitioning\nA hypergraph H = \(V,N hyperedges pins . The number of pins of a net is called the\nsize of it, and the degree of a vertex is equal to the number\nof nets it is connected to. In this paper, we will use pins[n]\nand nets[v] to represent the pin set of a net n and the set\nof nets vertex v is connected to, respectively. Vertices can be\nassociated with weights denoted with w[·], and nets can be\nassociated with costs, denoted with c[·]. The total number of\npins of the hypergraph is denoted by ? =\n?\nn?N |pins[n]|.\nA K-way partition of a hypergraph H is denoted as ?=\n{V1,V2 VK} where parts are pairwise disjoint \(i.e., Vk ?\nV = ? for all 1 ? k <  ? K nonempty\nsubset of V \(i.e., Vk ? V and Vk = ? for 1 ? k ? K i.e., ?Kk=1 Vk=V i.e., Wk =?\nv?Vkw[v part when\nthe total vertex weight is equally distributed \(i.e., Wavg =\n\(\n?\nv?V w[v satis?es the balance\ncriterion\nWk ? Wavg\(1 1 represents the maximum\nallowed imbalance ratio.\nFor a K-way partition ?, a net that has at least one pin\n\(vertex connectivity, is denoted as ?n.\nA net n is said to be uncut \(internal i.e n = 1 external i.e., ?n > 1  hypergraph\npartitioning. The one that will be used in this work, which\nis shown to accurately model the total communication vol-\nume [19], is called the connectivity metric and de?ned as:\nconnH  n ? 1 2  n ? 1 partitioning prob-\nlem can be de?ned as the task of ?nding a balanced partition ?\nwith K parts such that connH  framework\nArguably, the multi-level approach [20] is the most suc-\ncessful heuristic for the hypergraph partitioning problem. Al-\nthough, it has been ?rst proposed for recursive-bisection based\ngraph partitioning it also works well for hypergraphs [19], [8].\nIn the multi-level approach, a given hypergraph is coarsened\nto a much smaller one, a partition is obtained on the smallest\nhypergraph, and that partition is projected to the original\nhypergraph. These three phases will be called the coarsening,\ninitial partitioning, and uncoarsening phases, respectively. The\ncoarsening and uncoarsening phases have multiple levels. In\na coarsening level similar vertices are merged to make the\nhypergraph smaller. In the corresponding uncoarsening level,\nthe merged vertices are split, and the partition of the coarser\nhypergraph is re?ned for the ?ner one.\nMost of the multi-level partitioning tools used in practice\nare based on recursive bisection \(RB multi-level\napproach is used to partition a given hypergraph into two. Each\nof these parts is further partitioned into two recursively until\nK parts are obtained in total. Another approach is using the\ndirect K-way scheme with the multi-level framework, which\n?rst coarsens the hypergraph, then directly obtains a K-way\npartition of the smallest hypergraph in the initial partitioning\n201\nFig. 1. A simple hypergraph with 6 


nets and 5 vertices with the data structures used in the implementation.\nphase, and re?nes it while uncoarsening the hypergraph.\nHence, to partition a hypergraph, a K-way partitioner has only\none coarsening one initial partitioning, and one uncoarsening\nphase, where an RB-based partitioner has K ? 1 of them.\nOn the other hand, the initial partitioning and uncoarsening\nphases are much cheaper for RB since a K-way partitioner\nneeds a K-way partition in the initial partitioning scheme\nand a K-way re?nement at each level of the uncoarsening\nphase. Several works show that, the direct K-way approach\ncan be successfully used within a multi-level framework [11],\n[13], [17] and it can produce higher quality results. The only\ncaveat is that the partitioning time of a direct K-way approach\nincreases more rapidly with increasing K, in comparison to\nthe RB-based partitioner. In this work, we use a multi-level\nK-way partitioning tool UMPa [13] and apply the proposed\nsparsi?cation heuristics not only to the original hypergraph\nbut also to the coarser hypergraphs obtained in the coarsening\nphase to further reduce the execution time.\nC. Data Structures for Hypergraphs\nFor ef?cient access, hypergraphs are usually stored and\nutilized using two pairs of arrays which represent the hyper-\ngraph w.r.t. its nets \(i.e., pins i.e., nets gives the net view. The sizes of xpids\nand pids are |N |+1 and ?, respectively. The array pids\nstores the pin ids, and xpids[i] points to the start location\nin pids for each net i. The last value of xpids is equal\nto That is pids[xpids[i], . . . , xpids[i+1]?1] contains\nthe pin ids for net i.\n2 vertex view. The sizes of\nxnids and nids are |V| + 1 and ?, respectively. The\narray nids stores the net ids and xnids[i] points to the\nstart location in nids for each vertex i. The last value of\nxnids is equal to That is nids[xnids[i], . . . , xnids[i+\n1]? 1] contains the net ids for vertex i.\nIn multi-level partitioning context, these arrays are gener-\nated not only for the original hypergraph, but also for each\ncoarse hypergraph too. Hence, in any part of the partitioner,\naccesses to pins[n] and nets[v] of a net n and a vertex v\ncan be handled very ef?ciently. A toy hypergraph and the\ncorresponding data structures are given in Figure 1.\nIII. SPARSIFICATION TECHNIQUES FOR HYPERGRAPHS\nIn this section, we materialize this sparsi?cation approach\nfor the problem of scalable hypergraph partitioning. However,\nthe heuristics and algorithms proposed here can be used for\nother problems and applications.\nA. Identical-Net Removal\nAlthough we start with the description of the identical-net\nremoval heuristic, the techniques described in this subsection\nare also valid for the other heuristics in this work. The\nidenticality of the nets depends on the set of vertices they\nare connected to.\nDe?nition 1: Two nets ni and nj are identical if pins[ni]\nand pins[nj] are the same.\nGiven a hypergraph H=\(V,N the\nsame subset N, 1 ?  ? ?, if and only if they are identical.\nThe identical-net removal \(INR generates a smaller\nhypergraph H? = \(V ,N to N ? N for 1 ?  ? ?. The net\nn? is also called representative net of the nets in N, and its\npin set is de?ned as\npins?[n?] ? pins[n] s.t. n ? N, \(3 represen-\ntatives having v in their pin set.\nIn hypergraph partitioning context, if two nets ni and nj\nare identical they are either both internal or both external with\nrespect to a partition ?. Furthermore, ?ni = ?nj Since each\nnet’s contribution to the connectivity-1 metric given in \(2 cost of a representative n? ? N ?\nis computed as\nc?[n?] ?\n?\nn?N\nc[n]. \(4 vertex set V . The\ncontribution of net n? ? N ? to the cutsize connH of the nets in N to connH of identical nets. That is, the cutsize metrics,\nconnH  for the sparsi?ed hypergraph H? is also optimal\nfor the original H.\nSince INR is not expected to change the quality of the ?nal\npartition, reducing the overhead of the net-removal process is\nof utmost importance. The naive algorithm for detecting and\nremoving identical nets requires O\(V 2 sets. The number of these comparisons can be\n202\ngreatly reduced by using a simple checksum function,\nCS1\(n n?\ni?pins[n]\ni, \(5 their checksums must be equal. Hence,\nthe inequality of the checksums can be used as a witness for\ntwo nets being non-identical. On the other hand, such a witness\nis not suf?cient to identify false-positive net pairs who have\nthe same checksum value but are not identical.\nINRSRT ?rst computes the checksum values of all n ? N nSecond, it sorts the nets with respect to these values. And third,\nit examines only the nets with the same csum value at a time\nto see if they are identical. In INRSRT, during the examination\nfor a net n ? N , rep[n is set to an existing representative\nid \(line 4 representative does not exist, at line 5, rep[n] will\nbe equal to a new id, and a new representative will be added\nto H?. The pin set and cost of the representative are assigned\naccording to \(3 4 This algorithm has been\nused in the literature with similar motivations such as detecting\nidentical vertices 


in graphs [21] and identifying supervariables\nin a nested-dissection based matrix reordering scheme [22 It\nhas also been used to remove identical nets [17].\nAlgorithm 1: INRSRT\nData: H = \(V,N V,N  n increasing order of\ncsum values\nprev ? ?1\nr ? 1\nfor i = 1 to |N | do\nn ? ?[i]\nif prev = csum[n] then\nR n?r}\nr ? r + 1\nprev ? csum[n]\nelse\nrep[n] ? r\n2 for eachn? ?

If there are no collisions,\ni.e., no false positives, line 3 of INRSRT will be executed\nat most once for each net n ? N . Since each identicality\ncheck for a net n costs O\(|pins[n the total cost due to 3\nis O of con?icts, the total complexity is\nO\(|V| log |V w.r.t. two criteria:\n• False-positive cost: The number of pairwise compar-\nisons \(line 3 INRSRT for two non-\nidentical nets.\n• Checksum occupancy: The average number of distinct\nrepresentatives having the same checksum value. When\nno false-positives exist, the occupancy is one. Otherwise,\nit is greater.\nWhen all ? representatives have the same checksum value,\nthe occupancy is ?, and the false-positive cost is O\(?|N V| log |V N  Fortunately, hypergraphs from real life are random\nenough to avoid such pathological cases even with a simple\nchecksum function such as CS1. Still, it is better in practice\nto reduce the number of collisions to make the identical-net\nremoval faster. Yet again, using a simple function is also a\ngood practice since the cost of the checksum computation will\nbe less which may be important for some applications.\nAs described above, INRSRT sorts the nets with respect to\ntheir checksums. This operation can be considered as using the\nwitnesses to eliminate a huge amount of pairwise comparisons.\nHowever, when a good checksum function with a small occu-\npancy and false-positive cost is used, the sorting operation can\nbe the dominant factor considering the complexity of the rest\nof the algorithm. In this work, we propose to use another, hash-\nbased approach given in Algorithm 2, INRMEM that trades\nmemory for performance. The data structure we use contains\ntwo arrays, first and next, of sizes q and |N |, respectively, to\nstore the representative information. Here, q is the ?rst prime\nnumber greater than |N |. INRMEM ?rst initializes the entries\nin first to ?1 and starts to traverse the nets from n1 to n|N |.\nFor each net ni, by using the first array, it checks if there\nexist a net nc s.t. c < i and CS1\(nc ni mod q in first will be\nc, and ?1, otherwise. In the former case, starting from nc,\nthe algorithm initiates a set of consecutive checks \(line 2 line 4 c\n?[n?]. If\nno such representative exists, a new one is created \(line 5 line 3  distinguish false positives is executed only once for\nmost of the nets.\n203\nAlgorithm 2: INRMEM\nData: H = \(V,N  V,N  do\nnext[i] = ?1\n1 csum[i] ?

On the right, the\nfirst-next data structure at the end of the process is shown.\nSince the net information is stored in sets, the order of\nthe set elements should not affect the csum value, i.e.,\nthe checksum function should be order independent. Having\ncollision reduction in mind, in this work, we investigate two\nsimple order-independent checksum functions:\nCS2\(n n?\ni?pins[n]\ni2, \(6 n  7 modifying\nonly lines 1 of INRSRT and INRMEM, respectively. Another\nchecksum function we used is MurmurHash, a fast but order\ndependent hash function with good collision properties [23].\nSince the function is order dependent, we need to sort the pin\nset of each net in the hypergraph as a prerequisite for INRSRT\nand INRMEM.\nB. Identical-Vertex Removal\nThe connectivity information of hypergraphs can be viewed\nfrom two different perspectives: nets and vertices. Here we\ninvestigate a hypergraph sparsi?cation technique from the\nvertices’ point of view. The identicality de?nition of the\nvertices is similar to that of the 


nets:\nDe?nition 2: Two vertices vi and vj are identical if\nnets[vi] and nets[vj] are the same.\nGiven a hypergraph H = \(V ,N V\nare in the same subset V, 1 ?  ? ?, if and only if they\nare identical. The identical-vertex removal process generates a\nsmaller hypergraph H?=\(V ?,N corresponds to a V for 1 ?  ? ?.\nThe vertex v? is also called a representative vertex for vertices\nin V The net set and weight of a representative v? ? V ? are\nde?ned as\nnets?[v?] ? nets[v] s.t. v ? V,\nw?[v n?\nv?V\nw[v].\nAfter vertex removal, the pin set of each net n ? H? contains\nthe representative vertices having n in their net set.\nUnlike the case for identical-nets, the optimality of the\npartitioning is not preserved for identical-vertex removal: Let\n? and ?? be two optimal partitions for H and H respectively.\nThen we have connH  constraint since\nthe original hypergraph H is more relaxed in terms of vertex\nmoves, and some partitioning con?gurations for H may not\nbe feasible for H? due to its larger vertex weights. However,\nremoving identical vertices also reduces the search space for\nthe re?nement heuristics employed in the uncoarsening phase.\nAs the experiments will show, this may lead the partitioner to\na slightly better ?nal partition.\nWe use the same approach in INRMEM to detect the\nidentical vertices in H and to create H?. Hence, the imple-\nmentations of the identical-net and -vertex removal heuristics\nare very similar except that the former one uses xpids-pids\nwhereas the latter uses xnids-nids for ef?cient checksum\ncomputations. Although identical-vertex removal can be used\nfor any hypergraph, for partitioning, we only use it on the\noriginal, ?ner one, since the coarser hypergraphs are generated\nby a vertex matching process which is expected to match the\nidentical vertices with high probability.\nC. Similar-Net Removal\nThe sparsi?cation heuristics in the previous sections are\nsolely based on the concept of identicality and they only\naim to remove the redundancy from a large hypergraph. That\n204\nis, they are only effective when there exists identical nets\nand/or vertices in the hypergraph. Here, we will describe\nthe similar-net removal \(SNR is no redundancy. The heuristic can be\nconsidered as a lossy compression technique since it discards\nsome information while sparsifying the hypergraph. Although\ndiscarding information usually worsen the quality of the ?-\nnal analysis/partition, the partitioning process will be faster\nsince the hypergraph will be smaller Such a quality/time\ntradeoff will be very useful in practice, especially when the\nperformance of the application is not very sensitive against\nsmall changes in partitioning quality. The effectiveness of\nsuch a tradeoff depends on the discovery of a large amount\nof information which can be more or less compensated by a\nrelatively smaller representative. Considering each net is a set\nof pins, to attack the information discovery problem, we use\nthe well-known Jaccard similarity metric [24]:\nDe?nition 3: The similarity between two nets ni and nj is\nde?ned as\nJ\(ni, nj     of nets is large, it is infeasible to compute\nthe similarity for each net pair. Instead, in this work we\npropose computing a footprint of each net by using the min-\nimum hash values, which is an ef?cient way to approximate\nJ\(ni, nj  n rst vertex id of a net\nn ? N under the permutation ?. Then,\nPr[min?\(ni nj ni, nj words, if x is a random variable s.t.\n|x| =\n{\n1, if min?\(ni nj estimator of J\(ni, nj independent\npermutations and get the average of the x values to reduce\nthe variance [25], [26]. However, this alone is not suf?cient\nfor ef?cient hypergraph sparsi?cation since it is still based on\npairwise similarity In this work, to obtain a more ef?cient\nsolution, we use t permutations ?1 to ?t and ?rst generate a\nminwise footprint of each net. The similarity de?nition is then\nmodi?ed as follows:\nDe?nition 4: Two nets ni and nj are similar if their min-\nwise footprints are the same, where the footprint of a net\nn ? N is de?ned as\nmf\(n min?1\(n n V,N heuristic constructs a partition {N1,N2, . . . ,N?}\nof the net set N where two nets ni and nj are in the same\nsubset N if and only if their footprints are identical. It then\ngenerates a smaller hypergraph H? = \(V,N  also called a representative net for\nnets in N and its cost is de?ned as\nc?[n?] ?\n?\nn?N\nc[n].\nSince the connectivity of the nets in a subset N can be\ndifferent, the representation of the connectivity information\nremoved from H will be lossy, and the amount of discarded\ninformation depends on the assignment of pins?[n?]. We\ninvestigated three options:\n• Large \(LRG  largest pin set in N.\n• Important \(IMP  maximizes\n?\nv?pins[n]\n?\n? ?\nni?pins[v]?N\nc[ni]\n?\n? .\nThis metric prioritizes the pins which are connected to\nheavy nets with large c[.] values.\n• Union \(UNI   


footprints, we use the same approach\nin INRMEM to detect similar nets in H and to create H?. We\nchanged line 2 since we are now checking footprints instead of\npin sets. Among other minor modi?cations, we also changed\nline 6 w.r.t. the option we use while generating the pin set of\nthe representatives.\nD. Parallelization of Sparsi?cation Techniques\nAlthough they are much cheaper than partitioning, the\nef?ciency of the proposed heuristics may need to be improved\nby implementing them in parallel for other applications using\nhypergraphs If this is the case, the ?rst task, computation of\nthe checksum values is pleasingly parallel since each thread\ncan process a vertex/net without any concurrency problem. As\nthe experiments show, the sorting phase of INRSRT dominates\nits execution time. Hence, it should be the ?rst target for\nparallelization. After that, the false positive detection can be\nhandled by multiple threads where each thread analyzes a\ndifferent set of nets/vertices sharing the same hash value.\nThe proposed approach given in INRMEM is also amenable\nfor parallelization. Similar to INRSRT, the checksum compu-\ntations can be naively parallelized. After that one can do only\na single pass on the nets to build a variant of first/next data\nstructure by simply storing the id of every net in it without\ndoing an equality check. Figure 3 shows this variant after\nadding all the elements in the toy hypergraph of Figure 3\nwhen CS1 is used. Then starting from the non-negative entries\nin the first array, each thread can check the false positives\nthroughout the path by following the next pointers till a null\npointer \(?1 structure in Figure 2\nwill be obtained.\nFor some applications with huge and dynamic data, the\nheuristics may need to be executed several times and their\nef?ciency can be of interest. Hence, we believe that the\n205\nFig 3. The first/next structure when all the elements are added.\nalgorithmic details are important. However, in this work, we do\nnot experiment with parallel implementations of the heuristics,\nsince in the partitioning context, they are already cheap and\ntheir effectiveness in practice is much more important.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nFor the experiments, we used a machine with a 2.27GHz\ndual quad-core Intel Xeon \(Bloom?eld 48GB main\nmemory. All the codes is implemented in C++ and compiled\nwith g++ version 4.5.2.

As expected, the checksum functions are\nperforming slightly better in terms of occupancy when used\nwith INRSRT since the size of hash range is not limited, i.e.,\nthe same with the range of a 32-bit int For INRMEM, this\nnumber is q, the ?rst prime number after |N | which is much\nsmaller than the range of an int in practice. We observed\nthat except CS1, all other functions have an occupancy value\nclose to one which is the optimal occupancy. Hence, an\nO\(|N it is not enough and a good checksum\nfunction is necessary. As the ?gure shows, even a small\nincrease on the occupancy leads to a high false positive cost.\nThis is somehow expected because when there is more than\none representative sharing the same checksum value, all the\nnets corresponding to a representative need to be compared\nwith other representatives. And when the cardinalities of\nidentical/similar-net sets are large, there can be a large false-\npositive overhead. The experiments show that this overhead\nis usually much smaller than the overhead of the sorting\nphase of INR-SORT. Even for INRMEM equipped with CS1,\nwhich has the highest false positive cost, the execution time\nis much smaller than all the INRSRT variants. But INRMEM\nequipped with CS2 


is the best identical-net removal variant\naccording to our experiments, since the checksum function\nCS2 is as good as CS3 and MurmurHash, and at the same\ntime, computationally cheaper. Hence, we will continue to use\nit with INR-SORT for all our removal experiments in the rest\nof this section.\n\n\n\n\n\b\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\f\n f\n\n\n\n\f\n f\n\n\n\n\f\n f\n\n\f\n\f\n\n\f\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\f\n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\n\n\n\n\n\f\n\n\n\n\f\n\f\n\n\n\n\n\b\t\n\n\n\f n\f\n\n\n\n\n\f\n

PPGG outperforms the others by orders of magnitude.\nAlthough ERM simply determines the edges between any\nnode pairs according to a connection probability p, its running\ntime grows exponentially with n due to the high computation\ncomplexity O\(n2 Kronecker only generates graphs\nwith the sizes as i-th power of 2, we set i as 13, 17, 20, and\n23 to support n from 104 to 107. PPGG is able to generate\na graph with much smaller time because PPGG is allowed to\nef?ciently leverage the structures in the patterns.\nFigure 5 presents the results of the sensitivity tests on PPGG\nby comparing the running time with different supports. The\nvertex degree follows the power-law distribution with set as\n1.7. The graph sizes of Figures 5\(a b the running time decreases\nwith a larger support \(i.e., more pattern instances are inserted Pattern Preserving Phase is able to insert nodes\nand edges more ef?ciently than Graph Augmentation Phase,\nwhich requires more time because the latter needs to process\neach edge individually.\nFigure 6 further

As\nsuch, it becomes more dif?cult to ensure the DD and CC\nconditions in pattern overlapping during Pattern Preserving\nPhase, and PPGG needs to try more times to superimpose\ndifferent patterns. As C increases, as shown in Figure 7,\nPPGG needs slightly more time to generate a graph following\nthe desired clustering coef?cients, since Graph Augmentation\nPhase is required to insert more edges that can generate the\nmost number of triangles \(i.e., more cases with Cd > 0 insert an edge when\nCd < 0.\n685\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2E\nxe\ncu\ntio\nn\nTi\nm\ne\n\(s n=1.E+07, C=0.3\n\(a 2E\nxe\ncu\ntio\nn\nTi\nm\ne\n\(s b different ?.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7E\nxe\ncu\ntio\nn\nTi\nm\ne\n\(s a n=107\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7E\nxe\ncu\ntio\nn\nTi\nm\ne\n\(s 1.7\n\(b FUTURE WORK\nCurrent graph generators can only create the graphs fol-\nlowing the desirable statistical parameters. Observing that\nfrequent patterns have been widely recognized as important\ngraph characteristics we proposed a pattern-preserving graph\ngenerator \(PPGG target node number, degree distribution, and clustering\ncoef?cient, and the generated graph is guaranteed to contain\nthe frequent patterns with the required supports speci?ed by\nthe user. PPGG contains the two phases of Pattern Overlap-\nping and Graph Augmentation, and the experimental results\ndemonstrate that PPGG is ef?cient and able to generate a\nbillion-node graph in approximately 10 minutes. PPGG has\nalso been released as a free download.\nIt is expected that a massive graph usually has more\ndifferent kinds of frequent patterns than a smaller graph, under\nthe conditions of the same support. Therefore, a massive graph\ngenerated from PPGG may contain other frequent patterns not\nspeci?ed by the user. It is unrealistic for a graph generator\nto restrict the possibility that a generated graph can only\ncontain a set of given frequent patterns, because it will severely\nundermine the graph generation process to achieve the required\nstatistical parameters. Nonetheless it is reasonable for a user\nto specify a black list of frequent patterns that are not allowed\nto appear in a generated graph. Another way is to limit the\nnumber of unspeci?ed frequent patterns generated in a graph.\nOur future work will also explore this issue of undesirable\npatterns for PPGG.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work is supported in part by US NSF through grants\nCNS-1115234, DBI-0960443, and OISE-1129076, US De-\npartment of Army through grant W911NF-12-1-0066, and\nNational Science Council \(NSC 101-2628-E-001-003-MY3 Taiwan.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
