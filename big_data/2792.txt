But how to meet the need of learnersí personality in network study is still a big problem In order to support the personalized study better in the network environment, we take the personalized learning system as the research background. The artificial intelligence and cognitive technology were employed in the design and research of intelligent QA platform based on learnersí personal model. Such issues as the model building based on learnersí personality,  and the designing of Intelligent QA Systems based on this model to present adaptive knowledge are mainly explored 1. INTRODUCTION QA system is a necessary component of online learning platform. It can promptly solve learnerês puzzles to a certain degree, and help to eliminate their learning barrier, In addition, it plays an crucial role in strengthening communication between teachers and learners, which is quite helpful for the learners to clear about the question and hence aquire the knowledge they really need. At present, a lot of researches have been conducted in this area According to related literature report, these researches mainly concentrate on key word match, dynamic question connection, FAQ production as well as the feedback of teacherês teaching issues. Relatively speaking, the QA sytems designed by foreign experts are more intelligent For example, they support the i nquiry by natural language and provide richer content with higher quality. The most distinctive feature is that the excellent intelligent QA sytems abroad is running i ndependently, and they donêt belong to any teaching or learning platform. They act as resource providers in professional fi elds, and donêt link to teaching process. On the other hand, domestic QA systems are basically assistant of online edu cation, which help the teachers and learners in teaching and learning Obviously, online education has become increasingly popular. Although the model of keywords extraction and problems matching strategy has been extensively studied 002 in the designing of QA syst em, personalized interaction has been blowed over. Most advanced system through the keyword matching met hod has been looking for answers from the resource library, or providing FAQ to discussion areas such as BBS. The reason for this consideration is that the people in information acquisition process will be similar to some of the problems. In fact, questions must be quite different since the i nquirers are quite different in learning background, cognitive ability, and basic level and so on. These differences lies only in information and knowledge, and more importantly, in the depth of knowledge presentation. The traditional QA system take little consideration in the individual difference since it provides the same response to different inquirers, which inevitably limits its implication area In this paper, we discuss the designing of an intelligent QA platform based on the model of learnersê personality The main research point is on the use of data mining technology and other methods to extract the learners personality, and auto-adapted answer of question which inquirers provide based on questi ons of personal model. All these will involve the auto-adapted adjustment strategy based on connection with presents of questions. It has the extremely important theoretical significance for us to design a human, personalized intelligent QA system. The information acquired process i nvolves in inquires and replies. Without the design based on model of personality the quality of individualized information would not be ensured  2. Research on the mining of learner personality  The learning model is a user model aiming at online education. It is the abstract of one or a group of learners in online education environment, which describes such information as cognition level, the personalized characteristics of the learners. The learner model is the basis of implementing personalized learning. Nowadays the PAPI model established by IEEE LTCS is comparative mature. The model can meet the needs of teaching management well. However, it isnêt comprehensive enough in describing the learning behavi or.  For example, it is lack of the description of some non-intelligence factors \(such as personality, motivation, learning style extend some property of indivi duality to this model so that it becomes the basis of th e personalized intelligence QA

system. Whatês more, we conduct research on mining the personality of learners to ach ieve the relationship between learnersê personality and learning behavior. As the foundation of auto-adapted answering, all these will provide more comfortable service for online learners  2.1 The learning model aiming at personalized learning The traditional PAPI model contains the following information: statistic in formation of population, learning information, management in formation, relationship information, security information, preference information performance information and collective works information Among them, the description of the information about learnersê cognitive level was insufficient enough. For example performance information includes the resume of learners, the objective of current and future work situation work. Collective works information describes and testifies learnersê learning ability. However, this model shorts of the description of learnersê personality. Actually, the personality of learners will make a great contribution to study effect. For example , for a less self-confident student when he makes a right answer for a question, the human teacher would respond actively by such praise as "you are very good" to encourage him to go on to the next learning procedure; Comparatively, when a self-confidence student makes a right answer, teachers would respond like "not bad could you come to a higher challenge?" This kind of words encourages him to enter the next phase. Therefore, based on the traditional PAPI model, we extend a personality attribution to this model, which helps us to get a learning model based on learnersê pers onality as in the following table Table  1.  The learning model based on learnersí personality the learning model based on learnersê personality PAPI original model The expansion attribution of PAPI original model Statistic of population Name, age, sex, etc Academic Background Major, subject, curriculum, etc Learning information Brief information on learning Learning basis Score of Corresponding content scoring Master, understanding, knowledge, know what, know so little Management Brief management information Character Cartel 16 kinds of character attribution Relationship Relationship with teachers, etc Habit of learning Fast reading 001 intensive  reading , general reading, etc Security Password Learning dependence Extensive reading, intensive reading, etc Preference Parameters of promoting interaction between human and computer  others Health situation, etc performance resume 002 current work situation and objective in future, etc  Collective Works magnum opus and proof, etc   2.2 Research on mining learnersí personality  The measure of mining learnersê personality is to gather learner sample from internet, collect some basic information of the sample and analyze the relationship between learnerês personality a nd his learning behavior 2.2.1The Personality Mining Method Definition 1 Let C={c1, c2,É, cn} be an attribute set and Vi be the ciês range \( ci 002 C 1 002 Vi, the two-tuple \(ci, vij an attribute pattern of {ci 2 attribute pattern of attribute set Ck and the Cl, Ck Cl is not empty and Ck, Cl belong to C, then patternk patternl is an attribute pattern of the attribute set Ck Cl 001  002 003 Definition 2 Let P={p1, p2,É, pm} be an personality attribute set with 3 aspects related with the learnerês personalized learning--the characteristic, the motivation and the style. Then the pers onality pattern is an attribute pattern of P\002\(P \002 002 P Definition 3 Behaviour pattern is the quantitative description of learning behavior characteristic. Let B={b1 b2,É, bl} be the set of the behavior characteristic, then the behavior pattern is an attribute pattern of B\002\(B \002 002 B Definition 4 The Personality mining refers to that through the analysis of sam ple learnerês learning behaviour pattern and the personality p attern, gain th e rule between them and based on the rule automatically acquire the learnerês personality pattern In Internet learning envi ronment, learner's learning

behaviour pattern is heterogeneous and diverse 2 the personality pattern has many dimensions and most attribute values are numerical. Simply using the conventional data mining algorithm will cause a high level of complexity and low precision In view of the problem, we proposed the working mechanism of the personality mining algorithm as shown in Figure 1 Investigation of personality Sample database of learner's personality Analysisi of associative rules Mergering of personality attribute statistical analysis Obtaining personality Learning log Database of personality after mergering Pattern of learner's behavior Rules between personality and behavior  Fig  .1 illustrative diagram of  personality mining  Obtain the personality pattern through the 0017 investigation of the sam ple learnerês personality, and reduce its dimensions by combining the personality attributes Obtain the study behaviour pattern through 0018 statistical analysis of the learning journal Through the association analysis of the personality 0019 characteristic and the behaviour pattern, mine the behaviorpersonality rule According to the rule, reason the current learner's 001 behaviour pattern, and thus obtain the learner's personality characteristic  2.2.2 Description of learning behavior pattern  The learning behavior pattern is description of learning behavior characteristic. Let H={h1, h2, h3,ÉÉ hn}, and H is a set of learning behavior characteristic. Among them, hj is a kind of learning behavior \(such as number of browsing Courseware\hen a person has hJ,hK, two kinds of learning behavior then its learni ng behavior pattern is the subset of H {hJ,hK}.attention that the description of learning behavior characteristic is a quantitative description If the number of browsing courseware is three times, the value of hJ is 3, and so on . Thus the learning behavior pattern could be expressed as a certain number set Corresponding each learning behavior ,the set has a corresponding number value  2.2.3 Acquisition of Association Rules between personality and learning behavior  The personality characteristic is gained through matching the current learnerês behaviour pattern with the ruleês antecedent. The process is as follows Step1: Match the learnerês behaviour pattern item by item with the rule's antecedent and thus obtain a set of personality attribute values Step2: If there is an attribute with inconsistent attribute values, take the one produced by the rule with the highest confidence Step3: Use the product of personality attribute value and the corresponding weight to construct the personality characteristic vector Step4: According to the personality characteristic vector, classify the learners according to the result of personality clustering. Contrast the data and its result can confirm the accuracy of the personality mining method  2.3 Evaluation of learnersí cognitive level Because of different learning background, cognition ability, the original knowledge level and personalized characteristic, the questi on which learners propose would be different. This kind of difference lies not only in the difference in information and knowledge, but more importantly in the depth of information, namely the depth of knowledge presentation. Therefore 002 it canêt simply give the same answer to those different learners through the intelligent QA system. On the contrary, it should offer explaining with different depth according to different learners. Here it involves an evaluation on the learnerês cognitive level, and a certain degree of explanation is to be provided according to the evaluation. Thus, we proposed a kind of evaluation me thod based on learning background and critical knowledge. It can obtain the approximate cognitive level under the critical knowledge or the question By analyzing, statistics th e relationship of question and learning background of learnerês. In this foundation, it can realize navigation based on th e question explanation about critical knowledge Öthat is expansion of the auto-adapted depth  3.

learnerês personality consist of two parts: the traditional QA system and extensive intelligence QA system. The Extensive part includes: ac quisition of learnerês personality module; estimating of learnerês cognitive level module auto-adapted content present QA module and analysis and statistical of question module  Figure 1.the function frame of an intelligent QA system based on learnerês personality 3.2 Key issue to the implementation of the system 3.2.1 Auto-adapted presentation of the knowledge  Auto-adapted presentation of the knowledge includes the acquisition of question auto-adapted connection and the auto-adapting of explanationês depth. We use the traditional method---matching algorithm based on the keyword splitting to solute au to-adapted presenting of the knowledge. In order to solute the auto-adapting of explanationês depth. We shoul d provide some explanations with different depth and construct the attribution of the answerês depth, the variable can be described by fuzzy variable, such as {Shallow, moderate, deep}, at last, we operator the learnerês cognitive level and learner personalized model with corresponding weight. Through these methods, we get the value of the answerês depth attribution and obtain the auto-adapted answer from the answer depth attribution value 3.2.2 Statistic and analysis of the questions  We can grasp the distribu tion status and laws by statistical and analysis ques tions. The distribution status and laws can reflect the effect ion and loophole of the corresponding knowledge on net work, then we should adjust the teaching contents The statistical and analysis of questions in traditional QA system focused on chapter or knowledge. As we have introduced a intelligent QA system based on learnerês personality, the corresponding statistics and analysis should also increase statistics and analysis based on the model of learnerês personality, especially to analysis the relationship between learnerês academic background and distribution status of inquired questions thus, the algorithm based on learnerês cognitive level and auto-adapted answer under learnerês personality can be optimized well  4. Conclusion  The intelligent QA system based on learnerês personality can be used  to realize the communication between teachers and students, help students to be clear about the point of the knowl edge and obtain the required answer in network education. Additionally, it can be applied to various fields, such as the building of medical and hygiene website. Regardle ss of what kind of domain each learner with different request can get answer in different depth. The in telligent QA system based on learnerês personality is promising in the application The emphasis of this paper is to propose an intelligent QA system based on learnerês personality, and the key technology of how to realize it. We hope that it can offer readers a certain reference  References  Lin Jian Research on personalized inform ation service in web-based environment.

hash implementation\or costly further processing \(such as tree-building or transformation expected 3.3 Exploiting Structure Recurrence Structure information can be exploited to speedup various XML processing stages from tokenization well-formedness check and validation, to tree building transformation and transmission. In this subsection we describe in detail how Structure Encoding improves performance in each of these stages 3.3.1 Tokenization Tokenization scans the source document, checks syntax, and generates t okens. Tokens have types as well as values. In Structure Encoding, token types include: Start Element, End Element, Immediate Close Attribute Name, Attribute Value, Namespace Attribute Name, Namespace Attribute Value, Text, Whitespace Comment, Doctype, and Processing Instruction. Note that an attribute is composed of two tokens, an Attribute Name token, and an Attribute Value token Also notice that namespace attributes are treated differently from other attributes Tokens values are in the form of strings. For example the value of an Attribute Name token is the name of the attribute, while the valu e of an Attribute Value token is the value of the attribute It is quite evident that two token lists generated from two documents of the same structure have tokens of exactly the same types, and they appear in the same order. Furthermore, other than tokens of types Text and Attribute Value, token values are also the same This has two implications: one is that they occupy the same number of characters in the source document; the other is that if the token in the first document is syntactically correct, th en the corresponding token in the second document must also be syntactically correct Structure Encoding exploits these facts. It caches token lists for document structures. When a new document comes in, it first acquires the structure ID of the document by either hashing or extracting the ID embedded in the document. It then uses the ID to retrieve cached token list for the document structure Tokenization of the incoming document can be greatly improved in case of a cache-hit because  The type of next token is known, so there is no need to identify token type of the next construct  For most tokens, the tokenizer only needs to skip a known number of characters. For example, if next token is of type Doctype, then it only needs to skip a number of bytes based on the length of the value of the cached token  For most tokens, the tokenizer does not need to store values for them as it can share with the cached token. In above case, there is no need to create a string to store the Doctype construct 3.3.2 Well-formedness Check and Validation Well-formedness check in a typical XML parser verifies that  There is exactly one top-level element  All open tags have a corresponding close tag or an immediate close construct  All tags are correctly nested  Attributes of an element have different names  Namespace attributes of an element have different names  All namespace prefixes have corresponding namespace attributes defined in scope Note that none of these activities involve Text and Attribute Value tokens. As a result, if document D1 is well-formed, and document D2 has the same structure as D1, then D2 must also be well-formed. So there is no need for well-formedness check on D2 XML validation checks if a document conforms to the rules of a Document Type Definition \(DTD Schema. Continuing with above example, if D1 is valid for schema S, then D2 must also be valid for S if its Text and Attribute Value tokens are valid for S That is, validation of D2 is re duced to the validation of its Text and Attribute Value constructs 3.3.3 Tree Building Tree-based parsers need to build a tree representation of the document. This tree building process involves operations such as the allocation \(and later deallocation nodes, and the linking of allocated nodes into a tree Using structure information, once we know that the incoming document \(D2\as a previous document \(D1\operations can be optimized in following ways xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8 se id=c5bae136d32e1d7763a1a970d186e0ff books  books Figure 4. Sample Document with Structure ID Embedded

 Tree reuse: if D1 had previously constructed a tree and no longer needs it, then D2 can reuse it. All it needs to do is to reassign values for text and attribute nodes Values for text nodes are extracted from corresponding Text Tokens, while the values of attribute nodes are extracted from corresponding Attribute Value tokens Since, for a given value, the rank of its corresponding token in the token list is fixed, this reassignment process is extremely simple. This tree reuse approach obviates the operations for D1 to de-allocate \(or garbage collect the tree, the operations for D2 to allocate objects for each of its nodes and assign node values, as well as the operations for D2 to link these nodes  Fast tree duplication: in case D1 still needs its document tree, a duplicate of D1ís document tree is first made for D2. Fast tree duplication is possible by either preduplication when system is idle, or by re-organizing also could occur when system is idle\D1ís document tree so that nodes of the tree are aligned in an array, and that tree duplication is reduced to one simple memory copy  Tree sharing: by replacing pointers for text and attribute value pointers with corresponding offsets in token lists D1 and D2 can share the document tree. This tree sharing approach is ideal for reducing memory requirements if system expects concurrent use of documents of identical structures \(such as in a concurrent server environment\simple implementation of two in-memory documents of a same structure sharing the in-memory representation of the structure. Each document contains a pointer to the structure, along with a list of texts and attributes values 3.3.4 Transformation An XSL-based transformer generates output from a SS system has SS and the structure of D \(ST arrives, then this transformati on can be split into two phases  The Pre-Processing \(PreP arrives. It takes SS and ST as input, and generates Stencil SN, see below  The After Arrival Processing \(AAP when D arrives. It uses SN and Dís token list as input and generates the same output as would a usual XSLT processor for SS and D PreP is a partial transformation. It is a form of partial evaluation based on the partial document information contain in the structure of the document. Many costly XSLT operations, such as template matching and node selection, can be carried out in the PreP phase, so that they wonít be involved in the AAP phase, thus reducing the latency between the arrival of the document and the completion of the transformation The result of the PreP phase is a Stencil which assuming transformation result is in the form of text, is a list containing elements of the following types  String, which is the result of fully executed XSLT operations. \(Note that there are no adjacent strings in the list as they can be concatenated  Future Expressions which can only be fully evaluated after the document is received. Future Expressions canít be resolved during the PreP phase as their values depend on the values of text nodes and/or attributes. Future Expressions are evaluated at the AAP phase, taking the token list of the incoming document as input  Branches, which contains a Conditional Expression, a True Stencil which is selected when the Conditional Fi g ure 5. Documents of Identical Structure Sharin g Document Tree 
316 


Expression yields true, and a False Stencil which is selected when the Conditional Expression yields false A sample Stencil is shown in Figure 6 and described in section 4.3 The AAP phase uses the token list of the document to resolve the Stencil, by resolv ing the elements in the Stencil in order. String elements are directly emitted to the output. Future Expressions are evaluated, the result of which then converted to String and sent to the output. For each Branch element, depending on the evaluation result of its Conditional Expression, either the True Stencil or the False Stencil is selected and recursively resolved Note that Future Expressions can only take document token list as input and doesnít have access to XSLT variables. As a result, if an expression depends on an XSL variable whose value canít be determined at PreP phase \(because its value is conditionally updated by a conditional element\no transformation optimization for this combination of stylesheet and structure 3.3.5 Compression for Efficient Transmission Efficient transmission of XML documents is particularly important in mobile environments Structure recurrence can be exploited for compression and efficient transmission by avoiding the redundant transmission of structural information and by compressing recurring test nodes and attribute values  Assuming sender S first sends document A to receiver R and later sends to R document B which has the same structure as document A, if S knows that R has locally kept the structure information for A, then S only needs to send the structure identification of B, along with the text node and attribute values of B. Efficiency is achieved by replacing the structure of document B with the \(much shorter\identification of the structure of the document  Further, the text node and attribute values in document A has a 1-to-1 mapping with those in document B. If sender S is aware that receiver R also keeps text node and attribute values of document A, then when S detects that a value in B is the same as the corresponding value in A, S only needs to signal R to reuse the value in A, instead of retransmitting it The combination of the two offers potentially high compression ratio with very low computation overhead Note that it is not necessary for the sender and the receiver to be both aware of the existence of the compression. For example, in wireless mobile environments, the gateway of a mobile device can serve as the proxy between the outside world and the mobile device: XML documents are transmitted in compressed form between a mobile device and its gateway, while the gate way and the outside world communicate in usual text form 4 IMPLEMENTATION We have implemented in Java a XML tokenizer, a DOM-style parser, and a XSLT processor, based on Structure Encoding. The DOM-style parser is implemented as an exten sion to kXML, while the XSLT processor is implemented as an extension to XT 4.1 Tokenizer The tokenizer operates in three different modes  The Swift mode, which is activated when the incoming document contains sender assigned structure ID, and that cached token list for the structure is found  The Hash mode, which is activated when the incoming document does not contain sender assigned structure ID The hash function we use is an implementation of MD5 which generates 128-bit digests  The Nature mode, which is normal XML tokenization and is activated under all other conditions Fi g ure 6. An Exam p le of Transformation Stencil

Under Swift mode, the tokenizer checks each token in the token list, and takes different action depending on the types of the token  If it is a Text token, it reads a text string \(delimited by and may contain entity references\ the document character stream, and uses the text string to replace the value of the token  If it is a Start Element token, the tokenizer first skips a number of characters from the document character stream. The exact number of characters is determined by the length of the name of the element. It then enters a loop that reads attributes of the element. Within the body of the loop, it first checks if the next token is Attribute Name. If it is not, then the processing for the Start Element token completes. Otherwise, it skips the name of the attributes, reads the value of the attribute and updates the value of the next token \(which must be of type Attribute Value  In all other cases, the tokenizer simply skips a number of characters. The exact number of characters is determined by the type of the token and the length of the value of the token In the Nature mode, the tokenizer reads in XML constructs, makes sure that they are syntactically correct, and then converts them into tokens. Operations in Hash mode are mostly the same, except that the tokenizer also needs to send structure characters to the hash function for ID generation 4.2 Structure Encoding Based Parser Figure 7 shows a structure encoding based XML parser. It has three components: The Tokenizer as described above  The Structure Manager, which contains a cache manager that manages the reuse of document trees, and an optional Structure Optimizer, which does tree optimizations described in section 3.3.3  The Controller, which includes an interface with the kXML DOM parser. It also includes a Value Loader which does text node and attribute value reassignments The Controller falls back to kXML DOM parser, by passing to it a SAX parser implemented on top of the tokenizer, when it is unable to get a reusable document tree from the Structure Manager. Each document structure has a mapping table that associates a text node or an attribute value object with a token in the token list. The Value Loader in the Controller uses this mapping table to quickly grab text or attribute values from incoming documentís token list, and reassigns them to corresponding text node or attribute value objects. Figure 8 illustrates using Structure Encoding based parser to parse the book record document shown in Figure 1 4.3 Structure Encoding Based Transformer Figure 9 shows the components of a Structure Encoding based transformer hosted in the XT XSLT processor. Of its four components, the tokenizer and the Structure Manager are the same as in the parser The two different components are the Pre-processor and the Transformation controller Pre-processor carries out the PreP phase of structure encoding based transformation using stylesheet and document structure to generate transformation Stencil Within the document structu re, the text and attribute nodes are changed to objects of a special type, which upon access, throws a special exception which uses an integer index to indicate which text node or attribute is accessed. The structure is then treated as a regular document and fed to XT along with the stylesheet. We have also extended XT, so that any expression that may catch the above-mentioned special exception is extended into a Future Expression, which can be evaluated by taking only t oken list as input. A Future Expression in turn throws itself as a special exception which is then either caught by another Future Expression or, eventually, by an action. An action generates a result segment, which can be one of the following  A string, in the case when there is no special exception caught  A Future Expression, when one or more special exceptions are caught, and  A Branch, when the action is an IfAction generated from an xsl:if or xsl:choose XSL element.The Stencil Resolver in the Transformation Controller is called in the AAP phase after the source document arrives and a transformation is requested. It retrieves the Stencil using the stylesheet and the document structure as key, then uses the token list for the source document as input to Figure 7. A Structure Encod ing Based XML Parser

solve the Stencil, using methods described in section 3.3.4 Figure 10 shows a simple XSL stylesheet used to convert the book record document shown in Figure 1 into HTML format. Note th at it contains an xsl:if element, which tests if the ìspecialî price is greater than zero, and if the condition is true, it outputs an onsale price. Figure 11 shows the result of the transformation Figure 6 shows the Stencil generated by the PreP phase, where i  i th entry in the mapping ta ble \(see section 4.2 Stencilî contains a Branch, which has a ìGreaterThan Number Relationî that canít be pre-evaluated, as it depends on the number value of a Text or Attribute Value token. The True Stencil of the Branch is a simple Stencil, while its False Stencil is empty 4.4 Structure Encoding Based Compression The implementation of Structure Encoding based compression for transmission is straight forward. The sender and receiver both maintain an encoding table Each entry of the table is a mapping from a structure ID to a cached document structure as well as a list of template values for attr ibutes and text nodes associated Figure 8  Example of Structure Encoding Based Figure 9.

5 EVALUATION Evaluation experiments described in this section are conducted on a TI OMAP 1511 Innovator device which runs in frequencies up to 200MHz. It has 32MB ROM as well as 32MB RAM. The OS used is a version of embedded Linux, and the JVM used is Intent from TAO Group The source documents and stylesheets used for evaluation are randomly selected from Sarvegaís XSLTBench and DataPowerís XSLTMark [17  after initially excluding some unrealistic transformations. We select these two benchmarks as they are influential indust ry benchmark and that they both support XSLT benchmarking. Note that some of the large source documents are less likely to have recurrent structures in real-world applications. We included them regardless as they might help us understand the implication of document size on system performance. Table 1 lists sizes of sample documents and the transformation stylesheets used for them. Table 2 lists the raw numbers used in following discussions Documents are fully read into memory before any measurement starts to minimize external disturbance Warm-up runs are always conducted prior to real measurement runs 5.1 Tokenization Figure 12 compares the speed of Swift mode and Hash mode against the speed of Nature mode tokenization The Swift mode is by far the fasted, having a median speedup of 2.40 over Nature mode. The median speed of Hash mode is about 81% of that of Nature mode which means a median hashing overhead of about 23.5%. In the worst case, this overhead is about 37.4 for wai  5.2 DOM-style Parsing Figure 13 and Figure 14 compare speed of Structure Encoding based parsing against that of kXML parsing for both Receiver ID Assigning and Sender ID Assigning. In Receiver ID Assigning, the underlying tokenizer always uses Hash mode, while in Sender ID Assigning, the tokenizer uses Swift mode when cache hit ratio is 100% \(i.e., structure of incoming document is always in cache\ode when cache hit ratio is 0 Figure 13 shows the results for the ideal case when cache hit ratio is 100%: the median relative speed is 4.34 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 1.35 when Receiver ID Assigning is used. The best case is in backwords and game which use the same source document\to 8 under Sender ID Assigning Figure 14 shows the results for the worst case when cache hit ratio is 0%: the median relative speed is 1.07 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 0.90 \(or an overhead of %11.1\ID Assigning is used. The worst sample is wai where the overhead is about 20.5% under Receiver ID Assigning. The reason Figure 12. Comparing Performance of Tokenization Modes Figure 14.

that Structure Encoding is a little faster than kXML even when cache hit ratio is 0 is likely because of the fact that, while we use kXML for tree building, we modified it slightly to interface it with our tokenizer which resulted in differences in execution traces and slight differences in runtime performance when execute in JVM Overall, these two figures demonstrate that Structure Encoding based parsing provides substantial speedup when structure recurrence is frequent, and incurs low overhead when such recurrence is rare 5.3 Transformation Similarly, Figure 15 and Figure 16 compare transformation speed of Structure Encoding based XSL processor against that of XT for both Sender ID Assigning and Receiver ID Assigning. Again, under Receiver ID Assigning, the underlying tokenizer always uses Hash mode, while under Sender ID Assigning, the tokenizer uses either Swift mode or Nature mode Figure 15 shows the results for the ideal case when cache hit ratio is 100%: the median relative speed of Structure Encoding based implem entation is 5.38 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 2.72 when Receiver ID Assigning is used. The best case is trend  where the relative speed is over 39 for Sender ID Assigning, and over 25 for Receiver ID assigning Figure 16 shows the results for the worst case when cache hit ratio is 0%: the median relative speed is 0.996 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 0.918 or an overhead of 8.9 is used. The worst sample is nitf-stylized where the overhead is about 14.6% under Receiver ID Assigning These two figures show that Structure Encoding based XSL processing offers even higher potential speedup than parsing, yet incurs lower overhead in worst cases This is understandable as, typi cally, a large portion of operations in transformation is for costly structurerelated operations, which we have pre-processed offline. Note that, as long as structure recurrence is frequent, the potential improvement is very high \(up to a median relative speed of 2.72\even if the receiver has to calculate structure ID through hashing 5.4 Compression We conducted an experiment to examine the effectiveness of Structure Encoding based compression. In the experiment, for each sample document, we randomly changed the values of 3 rd 8 th  13 th i.e., one in every 5, starting from the 3 rd  attribute and text node values. Thus our experiment Figure 16. Comparing Structu re Encoding Based Transformation and XT  Cache Hit Ratio 0  Figure 15.

assumes that around 20% of the attribute and text values are different from the template values Table 3 lists results from this experiment. The third column of the table shows the number of bytes transmitted for each sample document, while the 6 th column shows the time used to construct tokens from the compressed document. The table shows that, under above-described setup, the amount of data transmitted are reduced to 2.6% to 15.7% of the original size second column, listed in KB time is reduced to 5.4% to 11.3% of the Nature mode tokenization time, or 11.5% to 25% of the Swift mode tokenization time 5.5 Discussion Since in our implementations, we make changes to base systems \(KXML and XT changes are required to implement Structure Encoding performance differences demonstrated in this section are caused by differences in techniques rather than differences in implementations Our experiments clearly show that Structure Encoding can, potentially, greatly improve the efficiency of XML processing with relatively low penalty for worst cases. The worst case scenario happens when a receiver uses hash function to identify the structure of a document, only to find out that the document structure is not in cache. The penalty it pays for such worst case scenario, 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and 8.9% for transformation, can easily be compensated by future structure recurrence. Such cache-miss penalty is negligible when sender-assigning scheme is used Systems that are conscious of such client-side penalty can let the sender or anyone in the middle of the transmission path to assign ID without altering the semantics of the message or document Although we didnít measure the impact of compression on parsing and transformation, it can be inferred from tables 2 and 3. For example, in the book case, with tokenization time reduced from 8.6ms Swift mode\s \(compressed\e will likely be further reduced from 8.8ms to around 1.3ms compared with 24.4ms for KDOM\Similarly transformation time may be further reduced from 11.5ms to around 4.0ms \(compared with 48.3ms for XT\Encoding based XML compression offers additi onal, significant performance improvements for XML parsing and transformation in mobile environments, where closelycoupled proxies commonly exists. With compression turned off, Structure Enc oding is fully compatible with Web specifications and can be used between any two Internet hosts, and it still offer very significant performance improvements when there is structure recurrence Without compression, for documents with recurrent structures, tokenization and structure hashing cost dominates the overall cost for parsing, and is the major part of the cost for transformation. Tokenization and structure hashing however are relatively simple operations that may be implemented in hardware with low cost. \(In fact, some mobile chipsets already have hardware implementation of hash functions such as MD5 for security purposes implementation can reduce tokenization and structure hashing cost to a fifth of the current cost, then there will be additional substantial improvement for the parsing and transformation of most of the documents used in our experiments In our system, a document havi ng a structure slightly different \(e.g., added a new element\from a previous structure will not be able to reuse the structure processing result of the previous structure. However our system pays off as long as this new, slightly different structure recurs in future documents 6 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we motivated exploiting structure recurrence to speedup XML processing in mobile environments, by reduci ng structure related transmission and processing costs. We presented the concept of Structure Encoding, and described approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures including one using collision-resistant hash function We explained in detail how to use structure encoding to speedup XML transmission, tokenization, treebuilding, and transformation. We described our implementation of st ructure encoding based tokenizer DOM parser \(based on kXML\processor \(based on XT\pression scheme. Our experiments conducted on a mobile test-bed demonstrated dramatic performance improvement in the presence of structure recurrence and low overhead otherwise. In ideal cases structure encoding offers speedups of up to 7 for parsing and over 38 for XSL transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change Structure encoding, however, is not applicable to all XML applications. Rather, it is more applicable to data-centric XML processing than to document-centric XML processing. A user randomly browsing Web pages is not likely to have high structure recurrence probabilities

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
