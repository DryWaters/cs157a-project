Autonomous Mining for Alarm Correlation Patterns based on Time-shift Similarity Clustering in Manufacturing System  Yan Chen University of Cincinnati NSF Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America chen2yn@mail.uc.edu Jay Lee University of Cincinnati NSF Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems Cincinnati, Ohio, United States of America jay.lee@uc.edu   Abstract 227 Current alarm systems employed in manufacturing applications are ambiguous in terms of indicating the root causes of process disturbances, which causes many difficulties for 
decision making. As manufacturing systems increase in complexity and scale, the continued reliance on human operators for alarm information management is impossible. A computeraided information management system would increase analytical capability for alarm analysis. To th is effect, an autonomous data mining method is introduced to search historical alarm logs for the correlations that can represent causal relationships, which can aid alarm management and system improvement. A hierarchical clustering method is used to carry out the correlation pattern search. Moreover, the similarity function of 
this method is designed to identify certain pre-defined correlation patterns. This method is validated in a vertical turning machine center alarm system application. The proposed method can discover a large number of alarm correlations, which are usually neglected by operators, and manage the alarms in the way that clarify process disturbance and enable rapid root cause analysis Keywords-manufactuirng process, alarm correlation patterns diagnosis, similairty-based clustering, frequent pattern mining Machine tool I   I NTRODUCTION  
To advance the automation of manufacturing process control, there is a tendency of growing needs for the automation of process anomaly management [1   Tr a d it io n a lly  when encountering anomalies, the controller automatically raises warnings or alarms. It provides immediate information so that operator can quickly evaluate what is occurring and take appropriate actions to remedy the anomaly situation. In most of manufacturing system, with hundreds of sensors, actuators or switches being connected to programmable logics controller PLC\ some alarms are fired by checking the threshold passing of measured variables. They are directly passed to controllers 
and displayed to operators as alarming messages. PLC also monitors system status variables by doing simple logic calculation and raises alarms when changes occur on them. The function of all alarms is to help correct human mistakes and careless operations during the manufacturing process However with the increase of system complexity and scale systematical analysis is needed to manage the alarm information described above. First, since a large amount of fired alarms actually do not indicate critical anomaly but only monitor process status, operator will need more clarified ranking of alarm significance to prioritize alarm messages as to 
make quick decisions and focus on the hidden root causes of anomalies. Second, lots of status-monitoring alarms provide boundaries to define the critical anomaly, though they do not pinpoint problems directly. If operators can recognize inherent correlation between these alarms, the alarm messages with clarified information will make diagnosis decision more accurate and timely. Third, in some complex systems, timedelayed failure propagation will continually cause \221phantom alarms\222 downstream, even if the upstream variables have been restored and the alarms have been deactivated [2 So 
operators\222 quick identification of the root alarms will reduce confusion caused by phantom alarms. All above situations require more analytical capability of alarm management. The total reliance on human operators for alarm information management has been proved to become very difficult [3 Therefore, comprehensive recognition is reached to develop autonomous analytical solution to support operators for quick response and fusion of accumulated alarm information [4  T h e  paper targets at manufacturing system and researches how data mining oriented alarms correlation analysis can manage overwhelming alarm information by adding more analytic capability to the system for the purpose of assisting operators 
decision making The organization of the paper is as follows. In section II selected alarm management methods are reviewed and compared with proposed method. In section III, we first overview the proposed approach step by step and then define the basic alarm occurrence patterns the paper will focus on Then we give some related definitions of the alarm model which will be used during the frequent pattern search such as

The machine is made by Dorries Scharmann and has Siemens 840D controller. It is used to machine large scale parts of certain energy generators. Totally 40 days data from real production are analyzed.  In this study we focus on the PLC alarms made by machine manufactures including three types shown in Table 2. Channel alarms indicate PLC channel status. They are usually displayed as warning or reminding message. Spindle/Axis alarms monitor spindle related status. Last part of alarms is defined by specific machine user to monitor the coolant, spindle temperature lubrications, and other concerned variables on machine elements. In fact most of alarms by process disturbance are with index ranging from 600000 to 700000. They will bring extra machine downtime T ABLE 2 PLC  A LARM  A lar m Index Range Alarm Source Total Alarms Types 500000~599999 Channel alarms 25 600000~699999 Spindle/Axis alar m 4 700000~799999 Machine user defined 33 As to illustrate the proposed pattern mining method, several experiment results will be explained in followings B  Experiment one In this experiment, first, the 40 days alarms with index ranging from 500000 to 599999 are converted into MAM day by day. And the mining algorithm is applied on every day\222s MAM. The discovered patterns are reported. Figure 6 shows a part of alarm matrix from 17th day. The X axis denotes time scale. Filled unit means non-zero event count during that binned time interval  If setup the dissimilarity threshold at 0.4 and use proposed mining algorithm to search alarm correlation patterns, the clustering result of the 17th day is shown in Figure 7 a\. Here the dissimilarity threshold is selected to encompass the optimal number of pattern candidates, which occur at a relatively high frequency. Total eight groups of patterns are discovered. So according to definition 4, we consider the eight groups of patterns are frequent. They are reported in the format as Figure 7 b\ shows   C  Experiment two Correlation patterns between channel status alarms and user defined alarms \(or spindle/Axis alarms\ can discover related channels status for the disturbance. Therefore, after applying the mining algorithm and setting up the same dissimilarity threshold \(0.4\ the result is shown in Figure 8 \(or Figure 10 In the result, the 7 th group indicates the active statuses of channel M24 and M25 have sequential relation with the detected events of \223tool magazine change door open\224 by PLC I/O. In fact this frequent pattern is discovered nearly on every day\222s report. The pattern happens with a sequence of 510118700040-510118-510119-700040 as Figure 9 a\ shows in detail and the b\ shows in long term. However, during 40 days, there are two days as Figure 9 b\hows \(April 09 and 10\n which the pattern has not been followed. Maintenance report showed this was caused by broken sensors and it is repaired in two days, though it has not caused total stop of machine operation This example proves correlation patterns between alarms can discovery some normal operation sequences.

This pattern narrows down the diagnostic search range for maintenance engineers during PLC logics checking  D  Experiment three In this experiment, total alarm counts per day are calculated by following method.  First, select the correlation frequent patterns with a dissimilarity of 0.2 from mining results of all three types\222 alarms; and sum up all occurrence counts of independent alarms and primary alarms to calculate total alarm occurrence count every day; Figure 11 shows results. Here primary alarm is defined as the most frequent alarms in every pattern. Without frequent patterns mining the operators will see average 370 alarm messages per day; if filter out repetitious alarms, average 149 alarm counts are eliminated per day  VI  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In summary, through autonomous mining for alarm correlation patterns using the proposed method, the following contributions can be achieved First, some frequent correlation patterns of multiple alarms can be discovered and they are able to reflect normal operation sequence. Any changing on the pattern can indicate abnormal disturbances by sensor degradation or operation mistakes. The pattern also provides good reference for later PLC alarming mechanism improvements. Early failure warnings can then be established based on the pattern to provide intelligent online or offline warning rather than just displaying simple hardwired threshold checking alarms Second, the knowledge accumulated from frequent patterns can facilitate decision-making. Some discovered patterns are able to clarify the boundary of abnormal process disturbance This can help engineers to quickly target the \223problem\224 networks in the PLC or physical machine elements.  The boundary information will also help engineers to reproduce the occurrence of the disturbance or failure during the diagnosis Third, a large number of alarms or warning messages happen every day, while some of them are related to each other; others are duplicated warnings of same disturbance Combining repetitious alarms in within the same pattern can help maintenance engineers make more precise diagnosis decision and focus on critical problems Currently, the proposed methods have been applied and tested on a machine tool system. In the future, these methods will be improved for more complicated non-serial and nonFigure 11  Alarm count 2 4 6 8 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 0 0 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 alarms seen by operator 04/10 04/11 04/12 04/13 510118 510119 700040  04/09 04/15  b Figure 9  Frequent pattern of the 7 th group 0 4 04/14 unique alarms after the orgnization Figure 10  Discovered frequent pattern of spindle disturbance  a 10 14 100 12 day count average eliminated alarm count/day   149.1714  time\(HH:MM alarm ID

We sign frequent predicate set in the same way of frequent itemset. Just like using Lk to represent the set of frequent k-predicate set, C k to represent the set of Candidate k-predicate set [1 In the former, there existed many algorithms by using the idea of Apriori and its several variations [5]. One of them can mine frequent predicate set from data cube, we call it Apriori_Cube. The difference between them is calculating the degree of predicate support instead of itemset. When mining multi-dimension association rules from data cube, one predicate set is the very set of dimension members from different dimensions in data cube d1  d n | count age-1, business-1, buys-1 the supporting number of predicate set is the count storage in the cell of data cube 2.3 The Formation Of Multi-Dimension Rules With the frequent predicate set having been found out, it is easy to pick up association rules [1 1 subsets 2 set, calculate the confident degree of rules s? \(I-s word, confidence = the confident number of I/the confident number s, if confidence ? PLQFRQI WKHQ WKH rules s? \(I-s 3. The Improve Of Apriori_Cube Algorithm 3.1 The Main Idea Of Improvements First using OLAP to simplify the data cube; second improving function gen_candidate \( Lk 


do 1. The dimensions and levels of mining task are determined by users requiring when data cube is built up. Sometimes it cannot certainly find out strong association rules or it may mine many rules which users arent interested in based on the levels of dimensions. Such as dimension area, when we talk about the problems of the world, the country level will be more useful than the province level. One solution of this situation is that adjusting the levels based to the amount and proximity of the rules which have been mined. But it means mining the data cube once again and while mining multi-dimension association rules, it also cant determine the dimensions which need to be adjusted accurately at the same time. So we think that analyzing the levels of dimensions at the same time of data mining, then using operations roll-up and drill-down of OLAP to adjust the levels, this is called On-Line Analysis Mining, at last carrying on mining process which will be more propriety and efficient Assume that users make an n-dimensions data cube and always hope the multi-dimension association rules mined can contain these n dimensions, on the contrary they arent interested in the rules containing only \(n-1 dimensions or even less [6]. In a word, it must find out the frequent n-predicate set. According to Apriori, every 1 subset of frequent n-predicate set must be frequent 1-set That means every dimension has a frequent 1-predicate set Obviously saying, once if some dimension doesnt contain a frequent 1-predicate set, the frequent n-predicate set must not exist So we check the frequent 1-predicate set after mining them from every dimension by algorithm: we can know that it shows the partition level of dimension we made is too low if some dimension doesnt have frequent 1-predicate set so we should raise the level of this dimension by roll-up; in the opposite, if every 1-predicate set of some dimension is frequent 1-predicate set, we should drill-down to drop the level of this dimension [3]. All of these adjustments will be embedded in mining process in order to strengthen the flexibility and targeting 2. In recent years, we also meet many problems like this when mining rules, most quantitative dimensions can be 


scattered, for example: dimension deposit can be parted in the form of interval as [0, 20K], [21k, 30k]and so on This discretization is commonly completed before mining 1]. So we can easily know that [0,20k], [21k, 30k] and the other intervals which belong to one dimension cant exist at the same time [4]. But there are still some special situations such as year which is parted by quarter level\(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4 problem what about the sales in both quarter Q1 and Q2, so when we improve the algorithm we must think about it too First of all, it is obviously that when mining multi-dimension association rules, one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension [5] without special requirements of users Combine this point with Apriori_Cube algorithm can help reduce the amount of useless predicate set, especially with the great growing of the amount Example 1 There are 4 dimensions of the database: A, B, C D, when the discretization of them has been complete, we can built a table of them like Table 1 A B C D a1 b1 c1 d1 a2 b2 c2 d2 Table 1:Examp1       Graphic1: Connection of example 1 When the 3-itemset come out, itemset {a1, b1, b2 must be contained, according we discussed before it is obviously unsubstantiated. We will use one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension to do the first pruning, so that this condition will not appear ever Second, when users make special requirements, we also should do some improvements. Such as the example before, when the algorithm discovered that one predicate set contains different levels from the same dimension as {a1 b1, b2} and checked out that this is what the users are interested in, so we will calculate the sum of the counts of a1, b1} and {a1, b2}, then assign it to {a1, b1, b2} and keep it in the frequent 3-itemset. We call this situation SP The algorithm improved also has steps connection and pruning, but the difference is that we use one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and the SP to do the first pruning in function

Performance Analysis Example 2 Lets talk about a practical problem just like the status of sales. Assume that we will mine the association rules involved 4 dimension attributes of sales, the minsup=25%. First of all, using OLAP technology to build a 4-D data cube and the 4 dimension attributes are: time location, item, and supplier. For location dimension which contains area, country and so on, we choose province level We use brand level for item dimension, company level for supplier dimension.

Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size 


of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.
