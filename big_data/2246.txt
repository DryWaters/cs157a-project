The \nnew point of this method is that we apply some filters on the \nsequence and on the total activity plot that makes our method more \nrobust to noise. This method has been shown to be very efficient on \na very big data of the new contest CHALEARN on hand gesture \nrecognition. This method can be a good reference for participants \nto the CHALEARN contest. The method is generic so could be \napplied for any shot boundary problem.  \nKeywords— shot boundary detection, filtering, CHALEARN, \nhand gesture \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nCHALEARN is a contest on gesture and sign language \nrecognition from video data organized by Microsoft [1]. In this \ncontest, candidates focus on hand gesture recognition. Besides \nchallenges on video data, one of the most challenges of this \ncontest is that only one sample will be used for training the \ngesture recognizer, knowing that traditional recognition nmethods require a lot of training data \(e.g. SVM, Boosting gestures are \nrecorded consecutively. Each video clip contains from 1 to 5 \ngestures from a small vocabulary of 8 to 12 gestures. To be \nable to learn a sample of each gesture, it is necessary to \ntemporally segment samples from video. We call each sample a \nvideo shot, each contains only one dynamic gesture. This \nproblem returns to the famous shot boundary detection \(SBD the \nboundaries between two shots in video. This problem has \nattracted much attention since video became available in digital \nform as it is an essential pre-processing step to almost all video \nanalysis, indexing summarization, search, and other content- \nbased operations.  \nThe general objective is to segment a given video sequence \ninto its constituent shots, and to identify and classify the \ndifferent shot transitions in the sequence. Different algorithms \nhave been proposed, for instance, based on simple color \nhistograms [2 3], pixel color differences [4], color ratio \nhistograms, [5]  edges [6], and motion [7 - 9].  \n \nIn this paper, we present a new method for temporal video \nsegmentation. In particular, we will deal with videos containing \ndynamic gestures; one has been recorded after another. These \nvideos coming from a very big database are taken by Microsoft \nKinect sensor\( both RGB and Depth information are provided training and evaluating one - shot learning \nalgorithms for gesture recognition in the CHALEARN contest \nthat we will present in more detail in the next section.  \nThe problem of shot boundary detection has been ninvestigated over many years and a large variety of techniques \nhave been proposed, and evaluated, from simple comparison of \nadjacent frames to more complex recognition of patterns of \nmotion vectors in compressed video [10].  \nAs CHALEARN is a contest, the participants do not want \nto publish theirs methods until the end Therefore, in the \nfollowing, we will only present several published methods that \nhave been proposed in the context of gesture segmentation of \nCHALEARN contest, the same as our objective. \nIn [11], the authors followed an appearance - based  \napproach for temporal segmentation. They aspired to find the \nframes that are similar to the beginning and ending frame in the \nun-segmented video sequence and define them as the interval nframes between two gestures in a video. Histogram of Oriented \nGradients \(HOG represent frame and K \nNearest Neighbor \(KNN  authors compute the difference between two \nconsecutive frames, then accumulate the difference for each \nimage to determine the total activity of the scene. Peaks \(local \nmaxima detected. Each \npeak and its surrounding correspond to a harsh movement of \nthe hand. The gesture segmentation is then based on the \nlocation of peaks and the limitation of surrounding.   \nWhile presenting the method, two papers above do not \nreport the temporal segmentation performance. In this paper, \nwe present a method and evaluate its performance on a whole \nvideo data of CHALEARN contest based on shot boundary \ndetection evaluation criteria. \nThe organization of this paper is follows. Section II \npresents briefly the CHALEARN contest and the video dataset \nto be processed. Section III describes the proposed method for \ntemporal gesture segmentation. Section IV shows experimental \n978-1-4673-2088-7/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 369\nresults and evaluation. Section V concludes and give some idea \nfor future works. \nII. CHALEARN CONTEST AND VIDEO DATASET nCHALEARN is a new challenge that focuses on \nrecognizing gestures from video data recorded by a Microsoft nKinectTM camera, which provides both RGB images and \ndepth images obtained from an infrared sensor. KinectTM nThis contest is organized in two rounds, one in conjunction \nwith the CVPR conference \(Providence, Rhode Island, USA, \nJune 2012 Tsukuba, \nJapan, November 2012 the first round have \nbeen discussed in [1].  \nThe dataset of CHALEARN is very impressive. We \nsummarize here some information about this dataset. They are \nportraying a single user in front of a fixed camera 


interacting \nwith a computer by performing gestures to play a game, \nremotely control appliances or robots, or learn to perform \ngestures from an educational software. The they have collected \na large dataset of gestures using the Microsoft Software \nDevelopment Kit \(SKD recorded with the KinectTMcamera, \nincluding RGB and depth videos, \n• with image sizes 240 x 320 pixels, \n• at 10 frames per second, \n• recorded by 20 different users, \n• grouped in 500 batches of 100 gestures, \n• each batch including 47 sequences of 1 to 5 gestures \ndrawn from various small gesture vocabularies of 8 to \n12 gestures, \n• from over 30 different gesture vocabularies.  \n \nFigure 1. Color rendering of depth images from the gesture challenge database \nwere recorded with a KinectTM camera \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Color rendering of depth images from the gesture challenge database \nwere recorded with a KinectTM camera and its components \n \n nFigure 3. Two informations provided by Kinect sensor \(Depth – Left, RGB – \nRight gesture recognizer, it is necessary to \nsegment each sequence into shots, each shot corresponds to one ngesture. As recorded by KinectTM sensor, each video has 2 \ndata: RGB and depth.  \nIII. PROPOSED METHOD FOR TEMPORAL GESTURE \nSEGMENTATION \nA. General framework \nWe propose a framework for temporal gesture nsegmentation from video as in Figure 4. It consists of three \nmain blocks \n• Pre-processing: This block takes the input sequence \nand makes some pre - processing on frames.  \n• Total activity computing: This block takes the pre-\nprocessed sequence and computes the total activity of \nthe whole sequence. \n• Temporal segmentation This block will make \ndecision of segmentation based on the computed total \nactivity.  \nIn the following we will describe in more detail each step in \nthe framework.  \n370\n  \nFigure 4. Main steps in the temporal segmentation framework \n \n \nB. Pre-processing \nEach sequence in the CHALEARN dataset composes of 2 \nvideos one is for RGB and the other is for depth. Both are \nstored in avi format. We propose to use depth information nbecause it is invariant to illumination change.  Then each depth \nframe in the sequence will be filtered by a spatial filter to \nreduce salt and pepper noise. As reported in [11], noise \nreduction improves 9% performance of the hand gesture \nrecognition.   \nC. Total activity computing and processing \nThe total activity of a sequence is defined as follows: Given \na sequence having N frames, first we compute the difference \nbetween the each pair of frames \(the current frame and the \nbeginning frame of the sequence total \nof absolute values of the differences. After processing with all \npair of frames, we have \(N-1 represent the total \nactivity of the sequence.  \n The figure 5 shows a plot of total activity computed for one nsequence. High values correspond to the strong movement \nwhile small values correspond to small movement of the hand. \nValues do not change in between several frames correspond to \na transition between two hand gestures.  \nWe found that the plot is quite noise. We then apply a \nGaussian filter to smooth it. In our experiment, the Gaussian \nfilter has sigma value equals to 7. After applying the filter, the \nplot is smoothed figure 6 vertical axe represents the total activity of the current frame with the \nbeginning frame \nD. Temporal segmentation decision \nTo segment a sequence, we will find local minima of its \nsmoothed plot of total activity that could correspond to a cut \nposition. Then we discard false alarms by keeping only \npositions at which the local minima satisfying following \ncriteria: \n• The value of local minimum needs to be smaller than nthe value of 3 surrounding.  \n• The value of local minimum needs to be smaller than a \nthreshold. The threshold is not fixed a prior but must be \nadapted to the considered sequence. \nAs we can see in the figure 6, only four true local minima are \nkept. Their positions correspond to frame numbers at which \nwe will cut into shots. \n \n371\n Figure 6. Plot of total activity and local minima of a sequence after applying a \nGaussian filter \n \nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nA. Performance evaluation measures \nTo evaluate the performance of temporal segmentation \nalgorithms, in [13], the authors have analyzed some quality \ncriteria: \n• Accuracy: In 14], a simple expression of accuracy has \nbeen proposed, which is equivalent to a measure used for \nthe evaluation of speech recognition systems \nAccuracy = \nT\nIC\nT\nIDT\nN\nNN\nN\nNNN ?\n=\n n   \(1 NI, NC are respectively the number of \nactual transition effects present in the video database, the \nnumber of transition effects deleted, inserted and correctly \nfound by the tested system.  \n \n• Error rate: Accuracy measure does not take into account \nthe complexity of the video sequence nor its size, in [15], \nthe author proposes a measure that evaluates the error rate \n\(insertion and deletion off transitions effects nwhole results of the segmentation algorithm.  \nError rate = \nIDC\nID\nIT\nID\nNNN\nNN\nNN\nNN\n++\n+\n=\n+\n+\n    \(2 n• Recall and precision: The measures are similar to \ninformation retrieval evaluations [16]: \nRecall nDC\nC\nNN\nN\n+\n       \(3 4 nground truth of temporal segmentation on 20 batches, each \ncontains 47 sequences. We will compare the results nobtained by our method with this ground truth.  \n \nB. Results \nThe results of temporal gesture segmentation are presented \nin Table 1. We apply our proposed method for 500 batches of \nthe CHALEARN data. Each batch 


contains 47 sequences. We \ncount the number of correct gestures in each sequence NC, the \nnumber of deleted gestures ND, the number of inserted gestures \nNI, NT is the number of gestures in each sequence provided by nthe ground truth. In fact, the dataset provides ground truth for \nonly 20 batches. For the 480 remaining batches \(22560 \nsequences accuracy and error rate based on \nequations \(1-4 nproposed for temporal segmentation algorithm gives the best \nperformance. It is better than the method propose by [12] . In \naddition, using the depth information gives lightly better \nperformance than using the RGB information. The result is \nthat the RGB information is more sensible to noise than the \ndepth information. \nTABLE 1.

This method has been validated as a very \nefficient for segmenting gestures from CHALEARN dataset. In \nthe future, we will use this method as pre-processing to extract \nsamples for hand gesture recognition training. This method is \ndifferent from [11 and [12] at two points: we make the total \nactivity by differencing the current frame with the first frame nthis one is more robust to noise than [12], that computed the \ndifference of two consecutive frames. In addition, both our \nmethod and [11] are based on the fact that the frames that are \nsimilar to the beginning and ending frame in the unsegmented \ntesting video sequence and define them as the interval frames \nbetween two gestures in a video. But [11] used HOG \n\(Histogram of Oriented Gradient n372\nframe and KNN \(K - Nearest Neighbor ours. Neither \n[12] nor [11] evaluate quantitatively the segmentation \nalgorithm. Then, the method that we presented in this paper can \nbe a good reference for people working in the domain of \ntemporal segmentation in general as well as participants to the \nCHALEARN contest in particular.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis work is supported by the project “Some Advanced \nStatistical Learning Techniques for Computer Vision” funded \nby the National Foundation of Science and Technology \nDevelopment, Vietnam under the grant number 102.01-\n2011.17. \n n \nREFERENCES \n[1] I.

machines in the batch region \nto a low-power state. \n \n \nFigure 4.  BEEMR Architecture [14] \nTherefore under tight design constraints, BEEMR achieves \n40-50% energy savings, and represents improving energy \nefficiency for an increasingly major class of datacenter \nworkloads [12, 14].  \nVIII. GREENHDFS \nR. Kaushik and et al. in 16] present an energy-conserving, \nhighly scalable variant of the HDFS called GreenHDFS. In \nother word GreenHDFS is an energy-conserving, self-\nadaptive, hybrid, logical multizoned variant of HDFS. Instead \nof an energy-efficient placement of computations or using a \nsmall covering set for primary replicas as done in earlier \nresearch, Green HDFS [7] partitions HDFS into disjoint hot \nand cold regions. Hot zone is always powered and the \n                                                           \n2   MapReduce with Interactive Analysis \n3  Berkeley Energy Efficient MapReduce \nfrequently accessed data is placed in hot zone. Green HDFS nfills the cold zone using one powered on machine at a time, to \npreserve write capacity. Because of the output of every job \nwould be located on a small number of machines and creating a \nsevere data hotspot for future accesses this scheme is \nproblematic. Furthermore, running the cluster at partial \ncapacity decreases the available write bandwidth and memory. \nIn other words, GreenHDFS relies on insightful data-\nclassification driven energy-conserving data placement to \nrealize guaranteed, substantially long periods of idleness in a nsignificant subset of servers in the cold zone. Cold zone consist \nof files with low to rare accesses, hot zone consist of files that \nare being accessed currently and the newly created files. The \naim of GreenHDFS is to minimize the number of servers \nallocated to the cold zone and maximize the allocation of the \nservers to the hot zone to minimize the performance impact of \nzoning and. Fig. 5 shows a 24% reduction in energy nconsumption of a 1560 server datacenter with 80% capacity \nutilization [16]. \n \n \n             \nFigure 5 Energy Savings with GreenHDFS [16] \nEvaluation results in [16] show that GreenHDFS in spite of \nthe unique scale-down challenges present in a hadoop cluster, \nis able to meet all the scale-down mandates. \nIX COMPARISON AND EVALUATION OF METHODS \nIn Table 1 we present comparison of the methods described \nin above sections. As you see energy efficiency of hadoop \ncluster with a covering subset of nodes provides saving energy, \nimproving utilization and CPU efficiency [7]. Efficient parallel \ndata processing on cloud with Nephele model in addition to \nthree previous supports network efficiency and instance \nefficiency [8, 10 Hadoop makes better adjustments to the size \nof the cluster to facilitate the increasing or decreasing demand nbecause it has many options to predict the work load of a \ncluster. As was mentioned, autoscaling hadoop cluster with \ncontrol panel supplies memory efficiency, CPU efficiency and \ninstance efficiency but some metrics such as memory usage, \njobtracker and tasktracker counters has not been considered [2].  \nThe efficacy of the method used in [12] would depend on how \nrapidly a node can be activated. Also dynamic energy efficient ndata with controller module covers saving energy, improving \nutilization and instance efficiency [12]. \nIn 7] one replica of every block within a small subset of \nmachines called the covering subset maintain by the covering \n22\nsubset scheme. This subset while the rest is powered down \nremains fully powered to preserve data availability. In fact, a \nfraction of the cluster decreases write capacity, write \nbandwidth and the size of current memory. Also, when error \ncorrection codes are used instead of replication, this scheme \nbecomes unusable since the covering subset becomes the total \ncluster [14]. \nEven under BEEMR [14], long jobs with low levels of \nparallelism stay a challenge. If job’s task durations are large, \nand batch jobs otherwise, these jobs are classified as \ninterruptible jobs. They could prevent batches from \ncompleting, if such jobs are classified as batch jobs. Their \ninherent low levels of parallelism cause the batch zone to be \nweekly utilized when running only these long jobs, resulting in \nwasted energy [14]. \n Finally in [16] HDFS divides into disjoint hot and cold \nregions by Green HDFS. Green HDFS to preserve write \ncapacity fills the cold zone using one powered-on machine at a \ntime and the frequently achieved data is placed in the hot zone, \nwhich is always powered. Consequently, the output of every \njob would be located on a small number of machines creating \na severe data hotspot for future accesses. Indeed, executing the \ncluster at partial capacity decreases the available write memory \nand bandwidth [14]. So, [16] simulate results with real world \nYahoo HDFS traces show that GreenHDFS can achieve 24% \nenergy cost reduction. \nTABLE I.

CONCLUSION \nWe investigated some methods for autoscaling of hadoop. \nIt should be noted, mechanisms may facilitate autoscaling of \nhadoop, but they may impose some of requirements on the \nprocessing framework design and ways that tasks are defined, \ntoo.

consider costs while add and remove resources. Whilst it \nshould know about the several types of available virtual \nmachines plus their costs and also it can allocate or release \nthem behalf of the client to the cloud. As was observed in any \nof the methods listed, so had tried to improve energy efficiency \nin hadoop Therefore according to estimates in the literature \n[14] and [12] that also listed in the evaluation methods table \n"The controller module” and “BEEMR" manners are better in \nimproving energy efficiency. As future work we decided on a \nnew way of ideas and try to use articles [14] and [2] to improve \nenergy consumption and autoscaling of hadoop. \nXI.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
