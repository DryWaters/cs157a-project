Evaluation of Risk Factors Selection in Cardiac Risk Stratification  E Yargholy 1,2 S Parvaneh 1,2   1 Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch, Tehran, Iran 2 Young Researchers Club, Tehran, Iran Abstract In the past few years a number of algorithms for cardiovascular risk stratification have been proposed to the medical community but a big question has been remained unsolved: From among alternative sets of cardiac risk factors which ones are more significant in cardiac risk stratification  In this paper a hybrid neurofuzzy classifier, IRIDIA Method for Neuro-fuzzy Identification and Data Analysis, was applied to determine the cardiac risk stratification. Using the obtained neuro-fuzzy model, sensitivity analysis of cardiac risk factors was derived to sort out cardiac risk factors according their significance - which factor has great effect on cardiac risk  1. Introduction The concept of cardiac risk factors has become an integral part of the modern medical curriculum and has led to the development of algorithms for cardiac risk assessment  Usually, the cardiac risk stratification methods in literature are either based on ECG data-driven or patient's medical data. The former includes QRS detection distances in time between wave s of RR, PR, and etc  A ge bl ood pre s s u re c hol e s t e rol a nd a r e  examples of the latter one 2 In the previously done researches, data have been measured, then several score sheets have been prepared accordingl  T he s e s c ore sheets can be applied to estimate people risk factor in general. The patient's data are scored by means of obtained score sheets Considering the scores, cardiac risk factor is calculated Framingham study is regarded as the earliest method in this era. The objective of Framingham heart study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to cardiovascular disease by following its development in the large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of cardiovascular disease or suffer a heart a ttack. The researchers went through medical history, extensive physical examination and laboratory tests Over the years careful monitoring of Framingham study population has led to the identification of major cardiovascular disease risk f actors, as well as valuable information on the effects of these factors such as blood pressure, blood triglyceride and cholesterol levels, age and gender [7 The use of scoring systems to stratify cardiac risk is currently hampered by method ological and mathematical flaws. Newer approaches ma ke use of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks, linke d to artificial intelligence Applying neuro-fuzzy method, the present study seems to initiate a new approach toward cardiac risk stratification So far, a lot of numeric analysis approaches of neurofuzzy systems have been presented. Most of these techniques divide the input data space, not considering the output data space, so the obtained rules should not be always reasonable. IRIDIA method is a simple and effective neuro-fuzzy network that divides input-output data space and extracts fuzzy if-then rules automatically This method searches for the right number of rules of the architecture by adopting a pr ocedure of cross-validation on the available data set   9       To aim at excellent fuzzy modeling, it is necessary to select adequate input el ements. Unnecessary inputs interfere with proper learning inference, and creation of efficient rules [10 S e n s i t i vi t y a n a l ys i s o f c a rd i a c ri s k  factors was derived by using the obtained fuzzy rules in order to show which factor has great effect on cardiac risk. When the factors are uncertain, and/or there are alternative sets of factors to choose from, the model output will also be uncertain. Quantitative sensitivity analysis tries not only to identify but also to quantify the relative significance of the factors [1 S e l e c t i on of  efficient input elements can c ontribute to the performance improvement, reduction of calculation cost and analysis of the obtained rules that is one of the important merits of fuzzy system  ISSN 0276-6574 665 Computers in Cardiology 2008;35:665-668 


  2. Database The present article develops a simplified cardiac risk factor model, building on the sex, age, cholesterol \(LDL and blood pressure. Family history for heart disease physical activity, obesity, cigarette smoking, diabetes and are not included because thes e factors work to a large extent through a major risk factors, and their unique contribution to cardiac risk factor assessment can be difficult to quantify [12 4  Statistic data of 165 patients in hospitals of Tehran 54 patients\ and Shiraz \(111 patients 1 were gathered The data included the following variables: sex, age, LDL blood pressure, and Myocard-brain Creatinine Phosphokinase \(cpk-mb\nzyme. The intensity of infarction was determined according to the amount of the enzyme \(in three different levels: no infarction, mild infarction, and severe infarction 3 Idea and method Sex, age, LDL, and blood pressure were considered as the input and infarction intensity was considered as the output           Fig. 1.  Assessment system  To draw the input-ou tput mapping of each group neuro-fuzzy networks were used. Having obtained a neuro-fuzzy model, we estimated the significance of input variables in making output with the use of Linkens method \(Fig. 1  3.1 Cardiac risk stratification At first step, in this study all the input variables including age, LDL blood pressure were normalized in the range of [0,1 u t p u t va l u e s o f no  i n fa rc t i on   m i l d  infarction, and severe infarction based on enzyme concentration are identified w ith numerical values of 0 0.5 and 1 respectively. Then the data related to men women, men-Shiraz, women-Shiraz, men-Tehran, and   1 Tehran and Shiraz are two big cities in Iran which are far away from each other  women-Tehran were partitioned into train and test sets randomly \(both sets included subjects with no infarction subjects with mild infarction as well as subjects with severe infarction\ %70 of whole data was used for training \(rule generation\nd the rest %30 was used for testing. IRIDA method was applied to data sets of men women, men-Shiraz, women-Shiraz, men-Tehran, and women-Tehran  IRIDIA Method The precise model of TakagiSugeno selected to be used as the fuzzy model. The program provided a set of structural alternatives in the definition of the fuzzy model: the shape of membership function of the antecedents \(Gaussian/triangular\he parametric form of the consequent \(constant/linear\he combination method of the rules \(weighted/comb\nd bias term which can be either used or not in the linear step of the nonlinear parametric optimization \(bias/nobias\urther, it is possible to choose between two different clustering policies, K-means/Hyperplane fuzzy clustering [15 t o pro v i d e t h e i d e n t i fi c a t i o n a l g o ri t h m  with good initial values of the center and base of the membership functions. Then we obtained 32 models for each data set Gaussian/Triangular,Cons tant/Linear,Weighted/Comb Bias/No-bias,K-means/Hyperplane IRIDIA method searches for the right number of rules of the architecture by adopting a procedure of crossvalidation on the available data set. It starts with a minimal number of rules and at each step increases the number of rules by restarting the global procedure until a maximum number of rules is reached \(the user is free to set properly what is the desired range of number of rules to range over\hen each struct ure is characterized by its error in generalization, estimated by a procedure of crossvalidation and the optimal number of rules is searched by comparing the cross-validation error obtained at different levels of number of rules. At the end of the global training phase, the cross-valid ation error is plotted against the number of rules used and the user is asked to choose the number of rules at which the fuzzy system looks to perform better \(Fig. 2 In order to have a definite range for the number of rules, points with coordinates of \(blood pressure, LDL age\ere exhibited in a 3dimentional space. Therefore regarding the distribution of data a range of 3-10 was chosen. For each of 32 fuzzy structures cross-validation error versus number of rules was plotted and number of those rules was chosen that produces the least crossvalidation error Selecting the fuzzy model, the number of rules was determined. The model was trained by the train set data Sex Age LDL Blood pressure Neuro-fuzzy classifier Infarction intensity Evaluation of risk factors selection 666 


  The trend was repeated for the 32 fuzzy structures  Fig. 2.  Cross-validation error versus number of rules diagram  In these phase, we used the trained fuzzy model to predict data output of train and test sets data. Considering the number of errors, we chose the most appropriate model Applying IRIDIA method led us to consider a distinction between males and females in cardiac risk stratification. Males and females were studied separately because they differ according to the age at which there is risk of infarction, but in the case of blood pressure and LDL, the differences are not considerable The results of the study directed us to regard subjects of different cities separately. Since life quality and conditions such as air pollution, life style and … differ in these two cities, so risk ranges of different age, LDL, and blood pressure levels are not the same in different cities and various adaptive strategies can be tuned up in terms of a specific population to st ratify the risk of cardiac disease  Table 1 Fuzzy models of IRIDIA method  Results of different groups of our research are summarized in Table 1.  Total error is the proportion of error numbers to the total number of data Tehran women data, in our database, was not enough to be applied to IRIDIA method 3.2  Evaluation of risk factor significance In this research, we used Linkens [1  1 7 m e t hod t o  compute input significance Since this method has to know the set of proper rules in advance, we first chose the neuro-fuzzy model and then computed the input significance Suppose that the dimension of the data, is  N 1   the number of rules, is N 2 and the dimension of the output data, is  N 3 The input data is expressed as follows   U= \(u 1 u 2 u 1 N  The subscripts i, j, and k refer to the input, the rule, and the output respectively. u ij is the membership value and w ij is the center value of the membership function. The logical form of the fuzzy inference if-then rules is given such as : if u 1 is j w 1 and …, u i is ij w u 1 N is j N w 1  is then y k is jk w Where ij w means the value near w ij  The lth input significance value is calculated z l ik    2 2 N j ij N j ik ij u w u  1 Next, the integrated input significance value from the ith input to the kth output is calculated using L sets of z l ik R ik  l max z l ik  l min z l ik 2 R k  i max R ik   3 Finally, the syntactic input significance value is calculated by accumulating F ik  F i   3 N k ik F 4 4  Results With regards to table 2, it can be concluded that cardiac risk factor significan ce differs in terms of gender and regional conditions The significance of input variables \(blood pressure LDL, and age\as approximately the same. So our input set has been appropriate and there is no need to decrease the number of variables or change them. Age, blood pressure and LDL, input variables, were sorted out according their significance resp ectively.

  of this study, the significance degree of a risk factor can be defined according to a specific population and specific region Table 2 Significance of input variables  For further research, additional risk factors, not available in patients' record s at the present, can be included to provide the me dical community with a comprehensive program which shows the risk factors significance in a hierarchical order 5. Conclusion In this paper we explained cardiac risk factor stratification based on a neur o-fuzzy classifier, IRIDIA method. Our Parameters consisted of sex, age, LDL, and blood pressure. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine: the resemblance of this model with the process under study, the quality of model definition factors that mostly contribute to the output variability and interaction between factors The capabilities of our method can be summarized as below More Risk factor, smoking background, life condition, obesity, diabetes, and … can be applied in the proposed method Extension of available data in database simply can be integrated in our model. Also, Extension of database with more data can yield more reliable results Using this method, risk factor assessment can be specialized based on different regions and life conditions Defining the most effectiv e factor, in each special population, prevention strategies can be adopted Risk factor can be compar ed in different populations and differences can be derived  References 1  Assmann G, Cullen P, Schulte H.

eliminates the energy waste of idle listening Another advantage of this scheduling algorithm is the mitigation of interference between concurrent communication pairs Consequently both energy and communication efficiency are maximized A GPS receiver at every node accommodates both synchronization and deformation measurements During active periods when bandwidth demands are highest the network will prioritize the information flow in the network and reserve the bandwidth for high-priority data based on mission-needs For instance if during volcanic activity gas measurements are deemed highest priority other data may be buffered to make more bandwidth available for gas data Cluster coordinators will be able to automatically identify and select the minimum set of sensors that will provide mission critical data Bayesian network techniques will be applied to address the sensor selection problem 14 To further optimize bandwidth utilization in-situ data reduction compression and aggregation will be driven by science requirements For example when necessary seismic data typically recorded at 100Hz will be reduced by two orders of magnitude at the node level by reporting an average Real-time Seismic Amplitude Monitor RSAM parameter which is an established measurement of both earthquake and volcanic tremor 15 In addition continuous seismic data will be streamed into a buffer at each node and when seismic events are triggered the buffered waveform with precise time markers will be compressed and delivered to the control center for higher level processing Power management The main challenge facing the power management of almost all wireless networks and in particular a volcano sensor-web is striking a balance between the need for high-rate data and the desire for network longevity The smart sensor node will have a builtin ability to adjust transmission power according to local density A dynamic transmission range setting algorithm 712 will be developed to maximize energy and communication efficiency in the network which is also part of the topology management algorithm To solve the problem that the nodes closer to the gateway consume more power and might die earlier we will investigate the possibility of deploying some relay nodes to relay messages for sensors so that the sensors lifetime can be prolonged Moreover the OASIS bandwidth management scheme will have an added benefit as it will establish a timeoptimum communication schedule as well as a cooperative power schedule of sensors Since each node alternates between reception/transmission and sleep states the energy waste of idle listening and contention will be eliminated in normal operation We are currently evaluating our innovative localized TDMA MAC protocols and have shown super performances in simulations Test-bed sensor node development The staff of the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory will design prototype and test the data acquisition sensors and communication hardware for the in situ sensor nodes As part of this design process early input from geodesists and seismologists will be incorporated to ensure appropriate sensors and capabilities are included Use of commercial off-the-shelf COTS embedded microcontroller modules with high level programmability is planned to enable rapid development and application of an affordable platform An expansion circuit and printed wiring board will be designed and produced that will include power conditioning and control sensor input multiplexing signal conditioning signal digitization and communications interfaces COTS sensors will include an LI GPS receiver for timing and deformation monitoring seismic accelerometer microphone or microbarograph for infrasonic detection of explosions and emissions lightning detector for ash cloud detection and other sensors such as SO2 gas as deemed appropriate by scientific design criteria Telemetry between nodes will be IEEE 802.15.4 and 900 MHz ISM spread spectrum as appropriate for the specific link requirements In an active volcano we can not rely on solar panel for energy because it will be covered by snow in winter and erupting ash in summer In our hardware package design each station consumes less than 2W power With several Air-Alkaline batteries our network is designed to survive for one year without solar panels 5 OASIS SPACE SEGMENT The OASIS will demonstrate the benefits of a feedback between ground and space operations This capability is essential for two reasons  It will make for more efficient operation of the in-situ element  It will trigger an in-situ deployment or enhancement at an unmonitored or poorly monitored volcano and will be able to ingest input as it gradually appears online Just as the in-situ component requires a scalable architecture so will the OASIS space element be designed to accommodate future space and in-situ observations as they come on-line NASA's Earth Observing system already includes an array of sensors relevant to volcano monitoring Table 2 each with its own data system and interfaces In order to create a common interface to each of these heterogeneous systems the OASIS will develop and implement the Open Geospatial Consortium Sensorweb Enablement SWE services for space and in-situ sensors to task and acquire observation data Table 2 Current and future volcano

12 Figure 6 Spoken Dialogue Interaction Figure 6 Spoken Dialogue Interaction NASA Ames Research Center has developed prototypes for intelligent agents applied to mixed human-robotic teams and to planetary habitats  1 1  These software systems were supported by facile mobile information systems and simulations of planetary surface surveys were conducted in analog environments  1 2  The intelligent agents implemented in the Belief-Desire-Intent language Brahms responded to questions like 322Where am I?\323 322What is the current activity What is the voltage from the generator?\323 and other queries of information available in the distributed IT system The agents would also initiate commands to the robots 322Robot take a picture of me\323 322Robot go to location 1 GPS coordinates 311\323 etc Note how useful these types of human to agent interactions could be aboard a spacecraft and how they mimic natural interactions between people Figure 6 shows a picture of an astronaut performing payload operations using interactive spoken dialogue interaction with a human on Earth However aboard a future transit vehicle this may well be an intelligent agent particularly when light speed delays prevent real-time communication with Earth Intelligent agents will be in effect the extra crew members needed to run and maintain the spacecraft A crew of 3-5 persons may not be able to operate a complicated spacecraft without the support of virtual crew members capable of working 24/7 Many functions can be handled or augmented by these virtual assistants Spacecraft monitoring maintenance and repair operations are obvious candidates given the amount of work required on these tasks Activities requiring specialized knowledge could be facilitated such as medical treatment by giving the human crewmember help in executing procedures for diagnosis and treatment The following are brief summaries of selected agent functions proposed for particular activities Repair Agent Intelligent agents can monitor subsystems and follow trends in operating parameters which might signal impending problems and schedule maintenance before the system fails or loses significant function or performance The following subsystems will need to be monitored continuously 1 life support 2 navigation 3 propulsion 4 communication 5 consumables 6 power 7 radiation shielding and 8 structural integrity Most repairs have complicated diagnostic and replacement procedures to be followed along with needed diagrams and technical information The spoken dialogue system can read out the procedure steps one by one and provide the necessary diagrams and pictures All of this material needs to be on the spacecraft so that no interaction with the ground is necessary to proceed with the repair A set of intelligent repair agents can significantly reduce the time to diagnose and complete a repair while improving the quality of the repair Medical Agent The crew is a vital part of the spacecraft and their health is as important to the success of the mission as the health of the vehicle The health of the crew will be monitored continuously both during exercise and normal activities This monitoring will have to be unobtrusive because of the long duration of the mission and this requirement is nicely met using body-worn sensors Sensor-bearing vests or shirts have been suggested as ways of measuring heart rate body temperature EKG and arterial oxygen These could be integrated with the sensors used to monitor location and body position for virtual HSI These sensors provide information wirelessly to the spacecraft medical intelligent agent The agents would keep track of all of the crew physiological data and analyze it for signs of medical problems in each crew member before they became serious Often trends in medical data are very valuable for finding conditions that may become serious in the future During medical emergencies like injuries or breathing difficulties the medical agent would interact with the care giving crew member to assist in diagnosis and treatment Much work has been done in the past to develop diagnostic decision trees which allow the system and caregiver to make a rapid diagnosis Since the medical agent would already have many of the vital signs it could quickly eliminate diagnosis sub trees that do not match the measured symptoms The agent could also communicate with earthbased flight surgeons for consultation saving time during serious medical conditions Crew Personal Agent Each crew member would have an intelligent agent to keep track of schedules exercise entertainment and correspondence with the earth On the long trip to Mars it will be necessary to keep up a rigorous exercise program Since the whole crew will be dependent on a limited number of exercise machines it will be necessary to schedule these machines between the whole crew The agent system will dynamically allocate exercise times and update the schedule in case of breakdowns and other delays Scheduling and coordination can be optimized and the results of this optimization sent to the Crew Personal Agent for execution by guiding the crewmember through 


13 scheduled activities This same concept can be applied to any constrained resources Communication with the ground will be delayed for up to 40 minutes so a system which keeps track of crew questions and answers received from Mission Control will be very important When the answer to a question arrives 2 days after the initial query it will necessary to pair the query and answer automatically to save crew time and jog their memory These communications will be in speech and text/picture form and will have to be indexed and tracked 6. T ECHNOLOGY D EVELOPMENT Implementing the MAA and associated HSI concepts will require investments in improving computer technology both hardware and software Fortunately very little needs to be invented since most components have either commercial or developmental predecessors Significant development of radiation-hardened avionics computing nodes would be needed Power consumption would have to be dramatically reduced Intelligent sensor modules would need to be developed all minimizing installed cost Sensor modules would need to be very small incorporating multiple sensing elements processor and network interface The MAA relies on high-performance computing and networks which can function at many times the rate needed for control This large excess of performance is used for implementing the voting and coherency algorithms needed for effective coordination Fortunately modern semiconductor technology provides the means to implement all of these features In addition to further development of low-power radiation tolerant electronics significant advances in avionics packaging would be required For example such avionics modules could not be liquid or conduction cooled rather thermal control would have to be passive Given the fact that no wired interfaces penetrate from the exterior the use of completely sealed packages would be possible which can increase reliability and interchangeability Network technology has progressed significantly with the adoption of AFDX time-deterministic Ethernet for critical aerospace control applications  1 3  This is being used in the latest Airbus and Boeing passenger aircraft Timetriggered Ethernet is a similar alternative Each method relies on issuing packets on a timed basis with sufficient gaps in between packets to allow other time-critical packets to be interleaved which produces bounded latency  1 4  Wireless network technology has similarly progressed but to date wireless time-deterministic networks have not been developed. Mesh routing software would be needed Today several products are available that perform mesh routing at either the MAC Zigbee or TCP/IP level Tropos Mobile IP routing has been flown aboard satellites in flight tests The biggest hurdle for implementation and biggest risk is the development of the necessary system management algorithms and software architectures needed for massively redundant peer-to-peer avionics systems Although much of the critical control for MAA can be adapted from IMA the larger number of possible redundancy solutions means that better means of maintaining coherency and failover would be needed Model-based system management and diagnostics could be useful in this area The system is reconfigured according to multiple constraints synthesized from current system state Planning algorithms could be used to determine the optimal process for reconfiguring such complex redundant systems Power transmission using inductive coupling is simply a matter of producing the correct magnetic interfaces Semiconductor technology providing the high-frequency driving current is used in every switching power supply 320 not an issue for technology development However providing an alternative power source maybe more difficult in that radiative schemes for power transmission may be difficult to apply internal to a spacecraft for humans Tripleredundant power distribution schemes are possible where each module couples with more than one distribution circuit Again low power electronics enables battery backup devices to be small and lowers the performance needed from wireless power transmission methods There are a number of building block technologies needed for the virtual disseminated interfaces we are proposing The various sensory display devices that physically present the information to the users are a real challenge These are devices such as miniature flat panel displays and audio interfaces for head mounted systems Recent advances in head mounted display technology benefiting from new OLED displays and redundant optical tracking systems make possible development of virtual cockpits based on body and head mounted displays that can present cockpit virtual images laid out within a user\325s 4   steradian field of regard Such displays can replace the much heavier powerhungry flat panel displays of conventional control consoles with bright high-resolution full color lightweight displays that only draw on the order of a few watts Other types of sensors such as miniature medical sensors currently exist and can be adapted to this use Array microphones can focus upon the speech of a crew member in a given known location The corresponding audio output function can be implemented using surround sound techniques commonly used for home theater Haptic sensors for interpreting motion and gestures are now available, but the feedback elements are lagging. Other types of user input devices are emerging and may be useful The main challenge for HSI is not the device development but rather the information and sensor fusion required for providing a coherent yet dynamic and flexible user interface The interface and display-rendering software that translates all the vehicle sensor and state readings into human sensory information and then encodes human voice and action responses into commands the spacecraft can use 


14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
