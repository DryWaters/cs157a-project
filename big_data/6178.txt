and Telecommunication e-GEOS an ASI/Telespazio Company Politecnico di Torino Rome Italy Torino Italy Abstract\227 Image co-registration is a widely used processing in many application 002elds such as medicine computer vision and remote sensing In each domain different techniques may be applied depending on the nature of the data avaliable and the wanted results In this paper we focused on optical and SAR based satellite images that need to be co-registered for a variety of reasons from change detection to interferometry from agriculture monitoring to surveillance and so on One of the main characteristic of satellite based imagery is the large amount of data that needs to be processed that usually leads to high running time thus limiting the kind of processing that can be effectively carried out To solve this problem a complete toolchain for image co-registration based on a GPU parallel architecture is presented the tool 003ow the detailed implementation and experimental results

contained in targets or in complex scenes can be well caught in image sensed by sensors like optical cameras radar and sounders to name a few in many application 002elds the 2-dimensional spatial information is not enough This arises when there is the need to compare or to jointly evaluate different images of the same target scene sensed with different sensors or under different acquisition properties such as different lines of view different electromagnetic wavelengths different kinds of sensors 050e.g optical  radar\051 and so on In these cases the different images have to be stacked in a way such that the same pixel in all images corresponds to the same point in the sensed target/scene often with sub-pixel accuracy Once images are aligned 050coregistered\051 in a stack for each point it is possible to evaluate the different features contained in different layers Typical application 002elds in which image co-registration is fundamental are medicine 050to combine information

050SAR+optical\051 for extracting geometric and re\003ective properties of the surface and so on\051 Co-registration processing requires a succession of automatic steps to be performed on the images First homologous points that is points corresponding to the same object or feature of the scene on both images have to be matched On the base of these points which are called Control Points 050CP\051 all the other correspondences are found out for each point Finally one of the two images 050slave\051 is warped over the other one 050master\051 Co-registration can be area-based or feature based depending on which information is used to 002nd out homologous points between the images If the matching is performed directly on the images values the co-registration is named area-based Otherwise if layers derived from images and containing speci\002c features which are favorable used for matching are used the co-registration is called feature-based Techniques algorithms and the implementation described in this paper are driven by the need to elaborate effectively and with short processing time images acquired from SAR and multi/hyper-spectral optical sensors 050onboard of planes or satellites\051 Such images have very different characteristics from those ones used in other application 002elds Indeed remote sensed images can have very large sizes up to 30000 002 30000 for e.g GeoEye panchromatic images 050 030 1.7 GiB\051 or complex valued 20000 002 20000 for VHR SAR data 050 030 1.5 GiB\051 Another relevant aspect to be considered is that remote sensed images have a very different nature from images acquired by standard cameras because features and patterns in remote sensed optical and SAR images have a high content of spurious signal and blurring effects 050due to atmosphere acquisition mechanism and sometimes satellite sensor defects\051 Moreover SAR images are affected by speckle 050a type of multiplicative noise\051 due to coherence of the radar signal therefore shapes and edges appear irregular and broken The work described in this paper is the development of a high performing co-registration processing tool able to manage remote sensed images both optical and SAR and exploiting multi-band features To this aim Graphic Processing Unit 050GPU\051 based architecture helps to reduce the processing time which is about two hours for the single thread processing of a 20000 002 20000 pixels image on a typical high end workstation to a couple of 1 


minutes The implemented techniques guarantee the robustness of the co-registartion and the exploitation of most of the features available in the input data Modularity of the co-registration processing chain allows for a strong adaptability of the processing and although the approach described in this paper is area-based the extension to a feature-based approach is straightforward by introducing speci\002c features extraction modules before the Matching Processor 050MP\051 To this purposes a module 050Control Point Filtering\051 has been considered to manage more complex matching criteria needed to perform the challenging any-toany co-registration between different kinds of sensor as for instance between SAR and Optical images 2 R ELATED W ORK Because image co-registration is a fundamental procedure in many 002elds research on it has been ongoing for many decades and following the evolution of the imaging systems has allowed the sophistication of the co-registration techniques Wide surveys of the techniques for different 002eld of applications with included rich bibliographies can be found in and 2 A key step in the co-registration process is the matching to carry out homologous points in couples of images of the same scene/target In this work the matching has been implemented by using the Pearson's correlation coef\002cient  which allo ws a v ery ef 002cient implementation in the frequency domain and on GPU architecture even in presence of invalid data As proof of the reached high maturity level of the Coregistration process commercial software tools providing image co-registration functionalities exist such as Exelis VIS ENVI or ERDAS IMAGE AutoSync 5]\051  Ho we v er  these tools do not support vectorial processing on GPU-like architecture yet although they have been recently updated to work on general purposes multi-core and multi-CPUs Workstation by introducing speci\002c multi-thread functions 050e.g for implementing linear algebra FFT    051 It is worth mentioning that in the application 002eld of photo-grammetry and general 3D model extraction for which there is a recent renewed interest matching algorithms similar to the ones used for co-registration purposes have been recently implemented on GPU architectures for instance in the last version of PCI Geomatics GXL and Microsoft UltraMap and  Finall y  no v el softw are for Unmanned Aerial V ehicle 050UAV\051 image processing in order to carry out 3D modeling of the observed scene exploit GPU based architecture 3 GPU S AND CUDA A modern Graphic Processing Unit 050GPU\051 can be used as a General Purpose computing device that acts as an accelerator with respect to the normal Central Processing Unit i.e a microprocessor core The accelerator looks like an Input/Output unit so it communicates using I/O commands and DMA memory transfers In this project we focused on devices manufactured by nVidia Corporation b ut similar considerations can be made with GPUs from other vendors as well Internally a GPU consists of many parallel processor cores in the order of several hundreds or even up to some thousands of a 050usually large\051 memory called device memory and wide interconnection busses to improve data transfer performance The parallel cores are grouped into several multiprocessors  with each of them having a small internal SRAM shared among all cores belonging to it used to cache the large device memory or to enable fast communication between cores This memory is called shared memory and ef\002ciently exploiting it often has a huge favorable impact on performance The execution model is based on threads that are run by each core Within a multiprocessor all cores execute the same thread on different data much like a Single Instruction Multiple Data 050SIMD\051 parallel machine but data dependent execution is handled in a slightly different way Threads can be suspended maybe because they make a slow memory access and other thread executed with the context switch taking basically no time Thus by having multiple concurrent threads the computational resources can be effectively exploited The programming model called CUDA 050Compute Uni\002ed Device Architecture\051 is based on the execution of kernels  each divided into a number of threads which are further grouped into blocks within a user de\002nable grid A programmer has to identify those parts of a program that could be best implemented on the accelerator by exposing the parallelism to ef\002ciently exploit the architecture Kernels are written in C language but the same C description cannot be compiled as is for the host processor so there is an additional effort in porting an application to use a GPU accelerator Many of the image processing algorithms employed in the context of this paper can be classi\002ed in three different categories depending on how the result is computed Assuming that the input is a set of images of the same size we can distinguish between 017 Pointwise algorithms where the output is an image of the same size of the input and the values of the output pixels depend on the values of the input pixels in the input images at the same coordinates These algorithms are the one that best suit the parallel architecture of the GPU In fact all graphic cores run the same code in parallel acting on separate pixels scheduling of threads and memory accesses can be easily optimized to achieve the best possible performance and a very high speed-up with respect to a sequential implementation can be obtained 017 Neighborhood algorithms where the output is an image of the same size of the input and the values of the output pixels depend on the values of the input pixels in the input images in a neighborhood of the coordinates of each pixel Algorithms accessing a neighborhood of a pixel can often be computed as a convolution of the input image with a 002lter represented using a matrix In many cases the 002lter can be separated into two independent one dimensional horizontal and vertical 002lters called the row and column 002lters They are then applied consecutively to obtain the 002nal result reducing the complexity from quadratic to linear in the size of the initial convolution matrix An ef\002cient implementation on GPUs of separable convolution 002lters is described in and the technique has been applied in many cases in this project However it has also been extended to cover a more general problem where the 002lter coef\002cients are not just scalar values but can be any mathematical functions 017 Global algorithms where the output is a single number or a small set of numbers 050i.e not an image\051 that depend on all the pixels of input images like computing the number of pixels that exceed a certain threshold A good technique to tackle 2 


these kind of problems in parallel algorithms is to use a treebased approach where partial results are computed at each step and propagated at successive steps until the last level of the tree sums up the 002nal value This algorithms are called Parallel Reductions  and their optimized implementation on a GPU is described in For each category a number of processing kernels have been developed and optimized for the parallel architecture of the GPU 4 G ENERAL C O R EGISTRATION F LOW Satellite and aerial image co-registration is a complex process that often requires different 003ows and parameters depending on the input images and the desired results Therefore a single monolithic tool is not recommended and a set of tools that perform speci\002c tasks is more advisable In addition to providing more 003exibility this solution also allows to design appropriate scripts for different jobs enabling batch processing of several image sets in various contexts To make the interaction between tools easier they should share a common interface Therefore all tools implement and adhere to the following set of rules and de\002nitions 017 Each project lives in its own directory with a pre-de\002ned folder tree to hold intermediate and 002nal results 017 The top level folder contains an XML 002le called mbc  config.xml  with links to the input images and a section 050or multiple sections\051 for each tool containing all the con\002gurable parameters and directives 017 All images have the same internal 002le format based on binary encoded 32-bit 003oating point values and an auxiliary 002le to describe the image geometry and characteristics 017 All point lists 050i.e control points\051 are given as XML 002les with many pre-de\002ned attributes that can be annotated during processing useful for image registration The set of tools include two programs called imrd 050image read\051 and imwr 050image write\051 to import and export images to and from the internal 002le format They are based on both the GDAL and HDF5 050[13]\051 libraries and can read and write all formats supported by them If geolocalization data is present it is extracted and made available to the other tools of the system Color and multiband images are decomposed into real or complex individual bands that can be treated independently in the entire 003ow and be recombined at the end of processing The rest of the suite is composed of 6 main tools called processors  and a number of ancillary programs for simple visualizations and processing Tools are brie\003y introduced here and are described in details in Section 5 Initial Guess Processor 050 igp 051   starting from a master and a slave image it computes a 002rst approximation af\002ne transformation to register the slave over the master It either uses geo-localization information already contained in the original 002les or a list of user provided control points in both the master and the slave images 050at least three control points are needed\051 or it uses a low resolution matching algorithm over a number of automatically de\002ned patches Control Point Selector 050 cps 051   it generates a list of ground control points 050GCPs\051 for the master image In simple cases GCPs form an equally spaced grid in more complex cases features such as the image gradient or contrast can be used to extract the most promising locations for the successive Figure 1  Processors and data layout matching step Matching Processor 050 mp 051   using the Normalized Cross Correlation coef\002cient it computes the local displacement of a patch around each control point in the master image with respect to the slave image Control Point Filter 050 cpf 051   based on quality measures provided by other processors it removes control points that may lead to wrong displacements and distortions Interpolation Processor 050 ip 051   using linear or polynomial interpolaion models as well as splines and Delauny triangles it estimates a displacement for all pixels of the slave image producing horizontal and vertical offset images Warping processor 050 wrp 051   given displacements for a pair of images it generates a warped version of the slave one using different interpolation techniques A graphical representation of processors and their interactions through data 002les is shown in Figure 1 Processors can be used in any combination and order but in most cases they are used sequentially as illustrated Some of them can be used multiple times with different parameters like for instance cps that can generate different GCP lists or can be used to assist igp in the low resolution mode In other cases certain internal data 002le are provided by external tools so the processing 003ow may skip some steps Processors are called from the command line with the project folder as main parameter and a section number as an optional one They scan the mbc  config.xml con\002guration 002le and extract the selected section 050or the 002rst one if the section paramter is omitted\051 to read further parameters needed to perform their task All processor support logging of processing and debugging information at different levels of details All processors make use of the available graphic hardware accelerator Satellites images are often pretty large so they require a lot of memory Although recent hardware devices have a signi\002cant amount of storage 002lling it completely happens frequently especially with multi-band data For this reason all tools implement some sort of slicing of input images to properly handle them but tool descriptions in the next section do not explicitly mention this feature 3 


5 C O R EGISTRATION T OOLS Initial Guess Processor IGP The goal of the IGP processor is to 002nd a 002rst approximate co-registration of the slave image to be able to restrict the size of the search window in the master image used by the matching processor MP The output of IGP is a single af\002ne transform to be applied to the slave image so that it approximately matches the master image This transform can include translation as well as rotation and scaling IGP can calculate this af\002ne transform in several ways depending on user choices and image characteristics If the two images contain metadata that allow geolocalization these data can be directly used The considered metadata are geographic coordinates of corner pixels geographic coordinates of speci\002ed control points geolocalization information of the image in WKT 050well-known text format\051 As an alternative the user can specify a list of correspondence between at least three pixels of master and slave images When redundant information is provided the af\002ne transform is calculated using a best 002t approach based on pseudo-inverse matrix calculation When no metadata are found in the images or if the user so wishes it is possible to obtain the af\002ne transform by performing a low-resolution matching of the two images This approach does not attempt to 002nd scaling or rotation of the images but only the approximate displacement between them However it will rotate and scale the slave image before trying the matching if so instructed by the user In this way it is possible to apply the matching between images at different resolution or orientations if they are known a priori The algorithm used is the following 017 A low resolution copy of the master and slave images is obtained by applying an af\002ne warp to the original images taking into account target image dimensions and user de\002ned rotations The warping is performed on the GPU and the resulting images are left in GPU memory In case the original image has invalid pixels these are propagated to the lowresolution images 017 The warped slave image is divided into equally spaced patches The number of patches in x and y dimensions are user de\002ned 017 Each patch is matched to the complete master image on the GPU using the same algorithm explained in details in the MP section without performing sub-pixel matching The displacement corresponding to the best matching is recorded if the corresponding value of the correlation function is above a user-de\002ned threshold otherwise the patch is de\002ned as invalid 017 Once all patches are processed the system has a list of possible displacements If the two images have at least a common portion several patches should report the same displacement plus/minus one pixel in each direction If such a displacement exists it is used to calculate the af\002ne transform between the images obviously taking into account the af\002ne warping used to obtain the two low-resolution images In the current version no attempt is made in low resolution matching to 002nd scaling or rotation between images other than those eventually speci\002ed by the user Several techniques are available in literature and will be investigated in the next version of the tool Control Point Selector 226 CPS The Control Point Selector automatically determines the list of ground control points in the master image In its simplest form it generates an equally spaced grid with the number of GCPs or their distance along each direction as parameter The list is also annotated with the patch size to be considered for matching and the desired size of the search area in the slave image As implementing the grid is straightforward it is not presented here A more interesting behavior is the automatic extraction of GCPs from relevant features of the image A feature is considered as any non negative real metric that can be de\002ned for each pixel with the assumption that the higher the metric the easier it is to 002nd a good match for a master patch in the slave search area A trivial mechanism is then to de\002ne a threshold and declare all pixels whose metric exceed that threshold to be control points However this technique does not usually produce acceptable results for two reasons 1  Depending on the chosen threshold the number of control points is often too low or too large 2  The control point distribution is uneven at best with too many control points localized in small areas and other areas totally void of any of them The CPS solves this problem using an appropriate algorithm that makes use of multiple thresholds and minimum distances between control points At the same time both the algorithm as well as feature extraction for some notable metrics are ef\002ciently implemented on the GPU hardware Feature extraction\227 Among the main metrics that are useful to 002nd good candidates for the matching phase are gradient and contrast  There are several possible de\002nitions of these metrics and a few of them were implemented in our system Gradient is de\002ned as G  q  G 2 x  G 2 y where G x and G y are computed using the standard horizontal and vertical 3 002 3 Sobel convolution matrices respectively Contrast is usually obtained by computing the standard deviation 033 over a certain neighborhood of each pixel however to be able to have similar contrast values for images showing very different dynamic ranges three user selectable kind of contrast called standard 050also known as coef\002cient of variation 051 normalized and extreme contrasts were de\002ned as follows c s  033   x c n  033   x 001 p  n 000 1 c e  x max 000 x min  x max  x min where n is the number of pixels in the neightborhood  x is the average value and x max and x min are the maximum and minimum values While for the gradient the neighborhood is 002xed by the convolution matrices used all contrast metrics allow to choose the area around each pixel over which computing the 002nal value The ef\002cient parallel implementation of feature extraction involves both pointwise kernels as well as neighborhood based kernels Gradient uses standard techniques for Sobel 002ltering to generate two images with the horizontal and vertical information and a pointwise kernel to compute the 002nal value according to the formula above In contrast determination pointwise kernels are used to create a binary map of valid pixels in the image and a second image 4 


with all intensity values squared A neighborhood based separable convolution kernel called unitbox is also de\002ned with all coef\002cients set the the value 1 When applied to the valid map the image and the image squared it is used to compute the number of valid pixels n v in a neighborhood and the two quantities P n v x i and P n v x 2 i  By de\002nition we can write  x  P n v x i  n v 033  s  1  n v X n v 050 x i 000  x 051 2  s  P n v x 2 i  n v 000 022 P n v x i  n v 023 2 Hence both the standard and the normalized contrasts can be directly computed from this quantities using a pointwise kernel Neighborhood based kernels are exploited for other computations as well The separable convolution approach described in Section 3 can in fact be extended by changing the 002lter matrix values with an arbitrary function to be executed within the kernel Using this strategy two convolution-like kernels were developed max convolution   the center pixel takes the value of the highest intensity pixel in the neighborhood min convolution   the center pixel takes the value of the lowest intensity pixel in the neighborhood They are used to effectively compute x max and x min for the extreme contrast case using the valid map to 002lter out illegal pixels Whatever the chosen algorithm eventually an image containing the desired feature is produced This image can be optionally saved for further processing 050for instance it can be used as an additional band in the matching processor\051 or is kept in memory as the base of the GPC extraction step and then discarded GCPs selection\227 As discussed above a single threshold is insuf\002cient to properly determine control point locations Rather the user is expected to provide a set of k pairs 050 t i  d i 051  where t i is a threshold value and d i a distance called the burning distance  The algorithm loops over the set of pairs and iterates on a given threshold to 002nd all possible control points At any iteration given a certain threshold a control point is de\002ned as a pixel satisfying the following two properties 1  The pixel intensity exceeds the threshold t i  2  Its intensity value is a local maximum within the distance d i around the pixel This de\002nition however leaves out many potential good control point candidates Consider for instance a metric whose one dimensional pro\002le over a certain direction is the one shown in Figure 2-\050a\051 with a triangular shape and suppose that the threshold corresponds to the dashed line According to the previous de\002nition only the vertex of the triangle is a control point as all the other pixels fail to meet the second property de\002ned above Nonetheless it can be noted that other pixels at a distance higher than d i from the vertex exceed the threshold and would be useful control points For this reason at each iteration a neighborhood 2 d i wide around the currently discovered control points is Figure 2  Control point discovery during iterations cleared or burnt  The successive iterations applied to the new metric pro\002le are able to discover new control points according to the previous de\002nitions as shown inFigure 2\050b\051 and 2-\050c\051 for the second and third iteration respectively However an hypothetical fourth iteration would not 002nd any new control point and the process terminates The parallel implementation uses two main functions each composed of a number of kernels The 002rst function identi\002es the GCP in the current feature image and keeps a map of them To do this it initially dilates the current image using the max convolution kernel already mentioned above for feature extraction with the distance d i as the size A second kernel compares the feature image the dilated image and the current threshold with the following expressions 1 feature\050x  y\051  t i 2 feature\050x  y\051  dilated\050x  y\051 If both conditions hold for a pixel then the pixel is a control point and it is added to the GCP map The third and last kernel counts the number of control points in the map using a global reduction method If the number of control points hasn't changed it means that iterations for the current threshold shall terminate and the next threshold is selected The second function is invoked only when there are newly discovered control points during an iteration and it is used to burn the area around them The max convolution kernel again with a size parameter equal to d i  is used to generate a map of burn areas starting from the map of 050newly discovered\051 control points The burn map is then used by a pointwise kernel as a mask to clear the feature image The last step of the algorithm consists in generating the actual GCP list This is performed on the host processor 5 


for simplicity although a parallel implementation is also possible Its running time is however negligible with respect to the rest of the algorithm so it wasn't considered necessary to optimize it Matching Processor 226 MP The Matching Processor 002nds the best correspondence of patches around control points in the master image in search areas in the slave image The correspondence is computed using a similarity estimates which can be implemented in a variety of ways In this project it is based on cross correlation which is often used for feature matching Cross correlation suffers of several shortcomings which are almost entirely solved using a normalized form called the normalized correlation coef\002cient 050NCC\051 Given a patch or template t 050 x y 051 050master\051 and an image f 050 x y 051 050slave\051 with the template being in general smaller than the image the NCC is de\002ned as 015 050 u v 051  P x;y 002 f 050 x y 051 000  f u;v 003 002 t 050 x 000 u y 000 v 051 000  t 003  r  P x;y 002 f 050 x y 051 000  f u;v 003 2 P x;y 002 t 050 x 000 u y 000 v 051 000  t 003 2 where the sums are extended over the 050 x y 051 under the window containing the template t positioned at 050 u v 051  and  f and  t are the average value of the image under the window and of the template respectively The NCC is always between 000 1 and 1 050extremes included\051 and the 050 u 0  v 0 051 location of the maximum identi\002es the displacement of the template over the image that gives the best similarity In our case the template t is a patch around a control point and the image f is the search area in the slave image A direct spatial domain implementation of NCC is possible but often leads to poor performance Yet the expression can be rewritten using convolutions rather than sums so a better alternative is to use the frequency domain However before showing the alternative formulation a couple of consideration shall be made 017 The template i.e the master patch is smaller than the search area For the purpose of this algorithm the template is extended to the search area size by zero padding and the added pixels are considered invalid 017 In the general formulation  t is a constant However we have the need to consider invalid pixels 050not the ones added for zero padding\051 which are removed from the sums and might be on the master or on the slave patches For any position 050 u v 051  the set of invalid pixels is the union of the invalid pixels in the master and the invalid pixels in the slave so the average value  t is not constant and becomes  t u;v  To overcome these two problems two masks k t 050 x y 051 and k f 050 x y 051 are de\002ned with value 1 for valid pixels and 0 for invalid one The template mask k t 050 x y 051 is zero padded to the slave search area size and if the template does not contain any invalid pixel the mask becomes a box To know the total number of pixels involved in the sums for each window position the convolution between the two masks must be computed to get a new image as z kk 050 x y 051  k f 050 x y 051  k t 050 x y 051 With this de\002nition we can write  f u;v  P xy f 050 x y 051  z kk 050 x y 051  t u;v  P xy t 050 x y 051  z kk 050 x y 051 with P xy f 050 x y 051  f 050 x y 051  k t 050 x y 051 P xy t 050 x y 051  t 050 x y 051  k f 050 x y 051 The normalized correlation coef\002cient can then be rewritten as in Figure 3 where all convolutions can be easily computed as pointiwse array multiplications in the frequency domain This formulation also has the added advantage that complex images can be treated in exactly the same way Whole pixel parallel implementation\227 The matching processor implementation takes as input a master image band a slave image band the list of control points and the af\002ne transformation For each control point before computing the NCC six buffers are created with the following data 1  The master patch zero padded to the search area size this is

to center the search area in the slave image already close to the 002nal position In this way the search area can actually be made much smaller than otherwise necessary However care should be taken for the slave patch buffers in fact in general the af\002ne trasnsformation gives a non integer translation and includes a rotation which should also be taken into account before the NCC is computed as NCC only identi\002es translations Therefore pixels cannot be copied directly to solve this problem a rectangular area of the slave image around the search area is copied to texture memory 002rst and pixels are fetched using hardware linear interpolation at non integer locations Once the buffers are 002lled in the actual NCC computation takes place The implementation over the GPU makes use of the CUFFT library that provides two dimensional FFT functions optimized for the parallel hardware The six buffers are transformed concurrently as a batch and a dedicated kernel has been developed to perform all the necessary multiplications for the de\002ned convolutions The inverse transformations are also carried out in batch Given the typical size of search areas around a few hundreds pixels wide batch processing better exploits the available parallelism compared to sequential transformations The frequency domain implementation of the NCC produces an output with the same size of the the slave patch with real values if the original patches are real otherise it is in general complex and the absolute value is considered The next step is to 002nd the location of the maximum however convolutions in the frequency domain also include the cases where the template master patch wraps around the borders of the slave search area but this cases shall not be counted This condition is best described in Figure 4 which illustrates the problem and shows the area in the NCC 002nal output where the maximum should be looked for either in the direct result or in the shifted version with the origin at the center of the 6

CPF implements several 002lters able to identify wrong control points 017 NCC absolute value 002lter removes control points associated to a NCC lower than a user de\002ned threshold 017 NCC relative value 002lter removes control point associated to a NCC lower than a user de\002ned fraction of the maximum NCC found in the control points list 017 Quality factor removes control points where several peaks of the NCC where detected by MP The quality factor threshold is user de\002ned 017 Abnormal displacement after all the previous 002lters are applied the processor calculates a best 002t polynomial displacement surface 050order selectable by the user maximum third order\051 using all remaining valid control points The distance to this surface of the displacement of each control point is then calculated and the points too far away are discarded The maximum distance is obviously user selectable The algorithm used to calculate this surface is the same implemented by IP 050LSP mode\051 and are described in the dedicated section CPF is completely run on CPU because it does not use large data structures that can take advantage of parallel GPU processing Interpolation Processor 226 IP The interpolation of the displacements computed by the mp module is performed by ip  after the validation and 002ltering performed using the cpf program The output of ip is a couple of matrices containing for each pixel in the warping grid the displacement in the X and Y directions to be applied in addition to the af\002ne transform de\002ned by igp  to correctly warp the slave image to the master image Several options are available to the user 017 Linear interpolation on Delaunay triangulation 017 Quintic interpolation on Delaunay triangulation 017 Least Square Polynomial interpolation of order zero to three 017 Thin Plate Splines Delaunay triangulation is a well known method of partitioning an n dimensional surface 050in our case 2D\051 containing a set of points of known coordinates 050the control points\051 into a set of non-overlapping triangles that cover the entire convex area obtained by connecting the outermost points of the surface A general implementation of Delaunay triangulation is illustrated in and a GPU v ersion has been de v eloped in 1  we b uilt on the GPU implementation by porting it to a 64-bit Linux architecture and incorporating it in our system Linear interpolation\227 Once Delaunay triangulation is performed on control points the surface corresponding to the whole image is scanned and displacements for each pixel are computed as a weighted sum of the displacements known at each vertex of the triangle that includes the pixel To speed-up computation rather than scanning pixels 050i.e looking for the triangle that includes a given pixel\051 the triangle database is scanned For each triangle the smallest rectangular region that includes it is computed and passed to a CUDA kernel in turn the kernel computes the barycentric coordinates of each pixel in the rectangular area if the sum of the coordinates is less than 1 then the pixel is inside the triangle and the three barycentric coordinates are the weights to use for the interpolation of the displacement Quintic interpolation\227 Several quintic bivariate polynomials can be selected to create a smooth surface without the discontinuities of the derivatives on the triangle sides that affect the linear interpolation We choose the method depicted in the polynomial coef\002cients are calculated by imposing the continuity of the 002rst dirctional derivatives on the sides of the triangles and by using a weighted directional average of the values of the displacements on the vertexes of the neighboring triangles Once the coef\002cients of the polynomial are known they are passed to a GPU kernel along with the rectangular portion of the image as in the case of the linear interpolation The GPU 002lls the appropriate area of the image while the CPU computes the polynomial for the next triangle Least Squares Polynomial 050LSP\051\227 When using the Linear or Quintic interpolation on Delaunay triangulation the amount of displacement applied in correspondence of the control points is exactly the one indicated in the input control points list or in other words the warping surface touches all input control points On the contrary LSP creates a smooth surface described by a single bivariate polynomial of a speci\002ed order as the interpolating function thus the warping surface does not necessarily coincide with the displacement indicated by the control points at their coordinates The coef\002cients of the polynomial are calculated using a least squares approach i.e the polynomial minimizes the sum of the squares of the distances of all displacements indicated in the control points list from the polynomial surface The least squares polynomial is calculated using the Nelder-Mead minimization method We use NM for every user choice about the degree of the polynomial 050other than 0\051 even if exact solutions exist for low degrees because the method converges rapidly has fast execution time and it is very easy to change the polynomial function to extend it to higher degrees We implemented polynomials up to the third degree 05010 coef\002cients\051 Once the polynomial coef\002cients are known they are used by the GPU to determine the displacement on the whole warping grid Thin Plate Splines 050TPS\051\227 This method implements the Thin Plate Splines algorithm using the input control points list as the constraints to calculate the TPS matrix The TPS is applied globally to the image This limits the number of control points that can be used in this algorithm because the processing time grows dramatically with the number of control points Our implementation is based on a portion of the sample code by Jarno Elonen available in public domain form in call ed Tpsdemo W e only used the functions needed to create the coef\002cients for the interpolation and stripped out all the editing functions We modi\002ed the code to be able to use the GPU to solve the linear problem that produces the TPS coef\002cients vector 050see for a concise and precise description of the mathematics\051 The inversion of the matrix is implemented in CUDA using the cublas library and parallel LU decomposition as documented in Once the set of coef\002cients is calculated it is used for interpolation on all pixels of the image using the GPU Our solution proved to be reasonable on large images only when the number of CPs is small 050less than 100\051 This is not due to the 002rst part of the algorithm that is the extraction of the vector of coef\002cients but to the subsequent interpolation that has to sum the contributes of all the CPs through the radial basis function U 050 r 051  r 2 log 050 r 051  To overcome this limit one should use some modi\002ed version of TPS taking into account that CPs far away from a given point have little or no effect on 8 


the point displacement A good introduction to the possible techniques can be found in Warping Processor 226 WRP The warping Processor receives as input a number of bands of the slave image the af\002ne transformation and the X and Y offset parameters computed by the Interpolation Processor and produces as output the warped bands according to the offsets Since offsets generally contain a decimal part various methods of interpolation of data can be used to get the 002nal result The easiest way is to round the offset to a whole number and take the exact value of the resulting pixel as the destination This technique is called nearest neighborhood it is simple to implement but can cause artifacts in the output image especially when very thin features are present Interpolation of the source pixels gives better results many approaches are possible but the most common are bi-linear and bi-cubic interpolations which are both provided However the perfect interpolator would be an in\002nitely long 2dimensional sinc 002lter which is unfortunately not feasible so a windowed version called the Lanczos 002lter is used instead The GPU texture memory already provides hardware assist for bi-linear interpolation In fact accessing the memory using 003oating point coordinates yelds a value which is the weighted average of the four closest pixels with a single memory fetch Performance are identical to using whole numbers and indeed our implementation does not actually distinguish between the two as the nearest neighborhood relies on the bi-linear function by simply rounding the pixel location To further increase performance the destination image is divided in blocks and a kernel operating in parallel on all pixels of a block has been developed A similar kernel was also developed for complex images using two fetches 050the real and the imaginary parts\051 rather than a single one as in the normal case Bi-cubic interpolation is even better than bi-linear as it uses a weighted average of the 16 closest pixels to determine a pixel value so it produces a smoother result However there is no dedicated hardware support in the GPU Fortunately instead of 16 memory fetches a bi-cubic interpolation mechanism can be achieved using just 4 bi-linear lookups by offsetting the sample position within each pixel and weighting the samples correctly as described in This technique has been again implemented for both real valued and complex images by using an appropriate kernel to process a block of pixels of the output warped band concurrently The Lanczos 002lter implementation is based on a windowed version of a sinc 002lter according to the following formulation 050in one dimension\051 L 050 x 051  032 sinc\050 031x 051 sinc\050 031x=a 051 if 000 a  x  a 0 otherwise where a is a positive integer and it is an input parameter of the tool 050typical values are between 2 and 5\051 The two dimensional version is simply the product of two one dimensional 002lters along the orthogonal axes i.e L 050 x y 051  L 050 x 051 001 L 050 y 051  where we assume that a is used for both the horizontal and vertical functions In the implementation the value a de\002nes a square region of size 2 a  centered on the location in the slave image de\002ned by the X and Y offsets and the af\002ne transformation if the af\002ne transformation includes a rotation the square is also rotated A kernel has been developed to evaluate the 002lter within the square region using integer coordinates for the source pixels and applying the proper coef\002cient given by the above expression All contributions are then summed to obtain the 002nal value for the warped image pixels As the Lanczos coef\002cients are already normalized no further adjustment is needed after accumulation Since offsets are in general 003oating point numbers the Lanczos 002lter has to be potentially evaluated for any value between 000 a and a  However to improve performance the horizontal and vertical 002lters coef\002cients are pre-computed with 1024 samples between any whole value This shall be compared to the expected precision of the estimated sub-pixel displacement which is no more than 1/30 of a pixel and therefore it is considered more than adequate To further increase the throughput the developed kernel performs the evaluation of the 002lter for many pixels in parallel Unfortunately given that each pixel has a different offset it is not possible to share contributions between adjacent pixels in the warped image so a separate thread is run for each of them In case the warping function is a rigid translation then the 002lter can in principle be separated into an horizontal and vertical one thus achieving a huge saving in running time However given that the transformation is almost never so simple this optimization has not been implemented 6 E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS The co-registration toolchain has been applied to many reallife satellite images from both optical and SAR sensors In this section two examples are presented to verify it against two main metrics accuracy and timing performance In both cases we relied on synthetically generated slave images in order to be able to correctly verify the obtained results In a 002rst experiment a sample high resolution 050 14320 002 11760  168 Mpixels\051 3-bands optical image is used as the master On the other hand the slave image is derived from the master with a known distortion applied The distortion is a third order polynomial with 006 9 pixels in the horizontal direction and 006 3 pixels in the vertical one An equally spaced grid of 100 002 100 pixels has been de\002ned where each master patch is 64 002 64 pixels and the search area size in the slave is 128 002 128  The matching processor is run using the sub-pixel option with accuracy of 1/100 of a pixel and the interpolation processor is used with three different algorithms Linear Triangulation 050LT\051 Quintic Triangulation 050QT\051 and Least Square Polynomial 050LSP\051 with degree 3 Table 1 gives the RMS error in pixels in both the horizontal and vertical directions for all cases As it can be seen the error is always very low and LSP is the most accurate with the QT being better than LT as expected Figure 5 shows the generated horizontal offsets by the LSP in the graph for each pixel of the image a bright value represents a positive x offset 050with white representing the maximum positive offset\051 and a dark one a negative offset 050with black the maximum negative\051 Co-registration timing performance are veri\002ed on two sets of images in the 002rst one images are 20000 002 20000 050400 Mpixels\051 with two bands while in the second they are smaller at 8000 002 8000 05064 Mpixels\051 but with 12 bands each 9
