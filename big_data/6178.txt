The  Argentine space agency CONAE  developed the SAC D spacecraft which carries Aquarius and other scientific sensors developed by Argentina Italy, France and Canada  The fundamental objectives of Aquarius are to enhance the  knowledge of ocean circulation climate variability land processes land use soil moisture and the hydrological cycle Le Vine et al., 2007; Lagerloef et al., 2012   Aquarius is an active/passive radiometer/scatterometer L band microwave instrument designed to map the surface salinit y field of the oceans from space The Aquarius microwave sensor includes a 2.5 by 3 m eter offset reflector and 3 radiomete r feed horns  Because of the angle these make with the reflector, Aquarius observes the surface along three parallel tracks \(so called  pushbroom design\ as the satellite progresses along a near polar orbit  The mission retrieves salinity measurements from the brightness temperature T B  emissivity of the sea surface which is measured with an L band radiometer 1.4 13  GHz frequency  in the  L band portion of the spectrum protected for radio astronomy   The emissivity  is modulated by the electrical conductivity of seawater which in turn varies with salinity   This is somewhat akin to conventional oceanographic salinity measurements made in w ater with CTD sensors  The seawater microwave signature comes from the surface layer of approx imately 1 centimeter optical depth   Aquarius also measures radar backscatter at 1.26 gigahertz to mitigate the em issivity variations due to sur face roughness To ac quire the SSS  measurement algorithms are used to correct for surface roughness a function of wind waves and rain atmospheric gases sea surface temperature  SST  Faraday rotation and solar and galactic emission  sources which collectively at tenua te the brightness temperature Unlike the SMOS  mission an onboard scatterometer is used to take simultaneous measurements of surface roughness directly along the swath [Le Vine et al., 2007; Camps et al., 2005; Font et al., 2004   T h e A q u ar i u s  s w at h  i s  3 9 0 km wide [Lagerloef et al., 2008  f o r m ed  w i t h  a t h r ee b eam  p u s h  b r o o m  co n f i g u r at i o n  76  94 84  120 and 96  156km the three separate sensors views the Earth at about 29, 38, and   46 degrees from nadir  with a repeat time of 7 days, equating to approximate ly four samples per month at a given location  Salinity varies in the open ocean from about 32 to 38 grams dissolved salt per kilogram of seawater measured with an international standard practical salinity scale based on electrical conductivity. To measur e such small differences, the Aquarius microwave radiometers were designed and built to achieve unprecedented accuracy by including temperature control to within 0 1\241 C in the instrument design  The Aquarius mission is designed to achieve a monthly average  global root mean square measurement error less than 0.2 \(practical salinity scale 321  approximately parts per thousand by mass\ at 150 kilometer resolution. The size of the Aquarius

Together with all its elements, it is known as the Aquarius/SAC D Observatory   The Aquarius/SAC D Observatory is a three axis stab ilized earth pointing low altitude Observatory that supports the nadir pointing instruments The Observatory in launch configuration, is an octagonal shaped spacecraft approximately 2.7 meters across and almost 5 meters tall, with a total mass of 1366 kg  including fuel. The bottom of the satellite incorporates two diametrically opposed hinges that support the deployable two wings solar array, 2.2 x 2.15 meters each, providing 1362 watts of power \(at End of Life, EOL Observatory power loads require a 925  W of orbital average power  Communications will use S band for telecommand and real time housekeeping telemetry, and X band for science data and store d housekeeping downlinks Four reaction wheels three torque rods and four dual thruster m odules are  used as attitude and orbi t control actuators. Redundant star trackers, redundant g yros redu ndant GPS Receivers redundant tri axis magnetometers and 12 coarse sun s ensors will be used for orbit attitude  determination purposes   The mission is being accomplished using an integrated set of Aquarius and SAC D flight a nd ground system elements The flight system  the Observatory  includes the eight remote sensing instruments and a Service Platform S/P i.e the spacecraft bus The ground system ele ments  include the SAC D Ground System that operates the Observatory from a Mission Operation Control Center MOC   and foreign instrument ground systems for operating and processing the data of their contributed instruments  The MOC interfaces with v arious ground stations for communications with the Observatory that includes transferring telecommands and receiving telemetry. Each  instrument contributing organization performs science planning instrument operations and science data processing through t heir own user ground systems  The routine Aquarius scientific data is processed at Goddard Space Flight Center \(GSFC\ and archived at PO.DAAC at JPL  III  C HECK OUT A CTIVITIES  This early orbit operation and check out is largely divided into 4 areas of commiss ioning   They are  spacecraft Aquarius instrument SAC D instruments and final orbit correction  A summary of activities for each of the areas is  described herein  SPACECRAFT COMMISSIONING  The commissioning phase of the service platform  was planned and successfully executed with  the strategy to verify in flight for  each subsystem/instrument/sub assembly its behavior and to compare to predicts analysis and tests performed prior to launch  In summary the strategy was to verify that a ll telemetry variables match  with the values obtained during environmental/functional testing of the Observatory R esponse to the on ground generated control commands were to be as expected  and the O n board automatisms perform  as tested nominally  AQUARIUS COMMISSIONI NG  The Aquarius initial turn on and check out activities were performed over 12 days during August of 2011  after the spacecraft completed its commissioning The approach for this Aquarius Instrument on orbit check out \(OOCO\ was to systematically turn on  each of the instrument\325s subsystem elements and checking out its functionality before continuing with the next element checkout  Each day\325s OOCO activities were performed and verified before final planning and approval was given to proceed Throughout the  OOCO activities instrument and service platform housekeeping and instrument housekeeping and science data was closely monitored and reviewed by the Aquarius instrument and the science teams. Each activity was executed with close coordination between the A quarius instrument team, collocated at the SAC D Mission Operations Control center, and the Aquarius and SAC D operations teams located at GSFC and Cordoba Ground Station respectively  All planned Aquarius commissioning activities were successfully comple ted   All housekeeping telemetry was verified to be within specified ranges and consistent with predicts and measure test values during system tests prior to launch. The OOCO activities completed with the instrument in its mission mode and fully functional  necessary to meet science objective Key thermal performance with the instrument\325s active thermal control achieved excellent control within each of the instrument\325s four thermal zones  Following the instrument\325s OOCO the instrument was  being closely mon itored for any impact or interference from the SAC D instruments\325 as they were turned on one by one  Currently the instrument is on in its mission routine science data taking mode generating salinity data for the Aquarius Data Processing Team and Scienc e team to collect validate and generate SSS  maps.  Typically, Instrument science data is being downlinked twice daily over the CONAE Cordoba Ground Station pass The Aquarius instrument and operations teams closely monitor the instrument telemetry looking  for any data trends that may impact instrument performance or forewarn the team of anomalous behavior  The Aquarius Science Team\325s assessment of instrument is that the radiometer looks stable on all 12 channels, wind response is close to expectations rela tive to reference wind models and there is no evidence to date of solar contamination Routine work is being performed by the Aquarius

 5  IV  I NSTRUMENT  AND  PERFORMANCE  The Aquarius radiometer is a three beam pushbroom  radiometer measuring the first three Stokes parameters at 1413 MHz with 25 MHz bandwidth [1   I t  o p e r a t e s  w i t h i n  t h e  1 4 0 0 1427 MHz primary exclusive allocation for passive sensing to avoid severe radio frequency interference RFI and still maintain sensi tivity to SSS  The radiometer is internally calibrated with a reference load and multiple noise diodes to maintain 0.13Krms/7 day stability  a nd e xt e r na l l y c a l i br a t e d using global averaged expected antenna temperatures or the oceanic vicarious cold poin t brightness temperature 3  f o r  longer term time periods. Pre launch calibration measurements were carried out to measure values and temperature coefficients of front end losses and noise diode excess noise temperatures after the methods in [4  T h e  p r e d i cted calibration bias prior to launch was  4.4 K \(3 sigma  Radiometer i nitial performance and calibration bias  assessment  Upon power up the radiometer achieved thermal and radiometric stability within the first few hours This allowed an initial perf ormance estimate to be completed on the first day of operation NEDT estimates were made over the open ocean using two sample Allan deviation calculations. The measured NEDT\325s are 0.12 K on 1.44 second integration footprints\ for vertical and horizontal p olarizations and 0.15 K for third Stokes parameter channels. The instrument starting on the first day continues to produce high quality antenna temperatures of the Earth\325s surface Two key design features enabling the observed performance are the strict th ermal controller and oversampling for mitigation of RFI The stable thermal environment created by the automatic thermal controller allowed the radiometer to produce quality data almost immediately after turn on. Likewise, the RFI mitigation system which is a combination of hardware based oversampling   a nd gr ound software based detection and removal 6  a l l o w s  t h e  ra d i o m e t e r t o  o p e ra t e  t h ro u g h  t h e  challenging RF environment found at L band Evidence of stable, RFI free data over the ocean can be seen i n the antenna temperature mosaic horizont al polarization shown in Fig 2  The diagonal striations are an artifact of the three distinct incidence angles and by using both ascending and descending passes   Figure 2  Mosaic of horizontal polarized antenna temperature during first week of operation starting August 26 2011 Data are gridded on 1.5 deg grid preserving the last acquired value Gray areas represent locations where at least one of three radiometers suffered persistent RFI  Finally an in itial calibration bias reference to ocean TA\325s was performed using both vicarious cold point and global average expected antenna temperatures. Biases on all channels were smaller than the maximum expected and negative indicating a systematic error in th e pre launch calibration  CALIBRATION DRIFT CORRECTION Subsequent daily analysis reveals a slowly varying drift in the calibration bias Such a drift was not unexpected and similar settling was witnessed during engineering model testing 7   T h e  m a j o r i t y  of the drift is a monotonic change in gain calibration likely due to changes in the noise diode coupling circuits. However, a second non monotonic component is also present and may be due to RF impedance changes in the front end The exact physical mecha nism is still under investigation but presently the drift signature can be explained by two different ratios of radiometer calibration counts where the first ratio is one of internal noise diode counts to external no ise diode counts and the second  is form ed by the ratio internal noise counts while switched to the Dicke load vs. the antenna. The former yields the relative drift of the two different noise sources and is found to vary monotonically with time. The latter is sensitive to front end impedance cha nges and carries the non monotonic signature The signatures of D1 and D2 can be fit to the observed calibration drift and used to reproduce it with an error of  60 mKrms providing strong evidence the drift is  indeed due to hardware changes A correction  algorithm based on these results is being developed  V  S CIENCE  F INDINGS   Understanding the links between ocean circulation t he global water cycle and cli mate variations requires knowledge of ocean surface  salinity Aquarius sat ellite mission http://aquar ius.nasa.gov moni toring  the global open ocean sur face salinity field embarked on its 322 science operations  phase 323  after completing the in orbit per formance assessment on 1 Decem ber 2011  The global map generated by Aquarius shows the predominant and well known climatological ocean salinity features, such as higher salinity in the subtropics, higher average surface salinity in the Atlantic Ocean compared to the Pacific and Indian Oceans and lower salinity in rainy belts near the equator in the northernmo st Pacific Ocean and elsewhere as well as the striking salty fresh contrast between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal These features are related to large scale patterns of rainfall and evaporation over the ocean river outflow and ocean circulation  The low salinity waters associated with the Amazon River outflow are clearly visible extending eastward from Brazil across the equatorial Atlantic Superimposed are surface current vectors that illustrate the relationship between the meanders in the surfa ce flow and the variations of the surface 


 6  salinity patterns These currents are derived from satellite sea level and surface wind measurements via www.oscar.noaa.gov  Combining these data sets in this way allows scientists to study the direct link between salinity patterns and ocean currents  As noted above another important element of the Aquarius microwave sensor is the scatterometer This sensor measures the radar backscatter at L band 1.26 gigahertz frequency from the sea surface simultaneously with the radiometer emissivity measurements This backscatter signal is proportional to the strength of the surface wind and waves roughness\ The Aquarius scatterometer has had exceptionally stable performance with calibration changes less than 0.1 decibels over a year, allowing highly sensitive detection of sea surface roughness  Areas of higher wind speeds are evident such as the tropical trade wind zones and the storm belts in the sub polar latitudes and lower winds in the subtropics Tropical or extra t ropical storms can also be identified, such as Prapiroon in the western Pacific Without some proxy surface roughness accurate salinity retrievals would not be possible Numerical wind forecasts have limitations because of their lack of accuracy and coinc idence in time with the satellite measurements. Aquarius solves this problem with simultaneous measurements that significantly improve the accuracy of the salinity data  The most interesting findings came from the scientists at JPL   Tong Lee Gary Lagerloe f Michelle M Gierach Hsun Ying Kao Simon Yueh and Kathleen Dohan 322Aquarius reveals salinity structure of tropical instability waves\323 Geophysical Research Letters  VOL 39 L12610 doi:10.1029/2012GL052232, 2012  on the s alinity structure of Tropica l instability waves  TIW This was the f irst Aquarius Science Application Publication   The paper documented SSS  measurements from the Aquarius/SAC D satellite during September 320 December 2011 provide the first satellite observations of the salinity struct ure  of TIWs  in the Pacific The related SSS anomaly ha s a magnitude of approximately 0.5 PSU Differen t from SST  and sea surface height anomaly SSHA\where TIW related propagating signals are stronger a few degrees away from the equator, the SSS signature  of TIWs is largest near the equator in the eastern equatorial Pacific where salty South Pacific water meets the fresher Inter tropical Convergence Zone water. The dominant westward propagation speed of SSS near the equator is approximately 1 m/s. This is twice as fast as the 0.5 m/s TIW speed widely reported in the literature typically from SST and SSHA away from the equator. This difference is attributed to the more dominant 17 day TIWs near the equator that have a 1 m/s dominant phase speed and the stro nger 33 day TIWs away from the equator that have a 0.5 m/s dominant phase speed The results demonstrate the important value of Aquarius in studying TIWs   TIWs are westward prop agating planetary scale waves that exist on both sides of the equatorial cold  tongues in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans e.g Legeckis 1977 Legeckis and Reverdin 1987 Chelton et al 2000   T h e y  a r e  c a u s e d  b y  barotropic and baroclinic instability associated with the meridional and vertical shear of the equatorial current syst ems e.g Philander 1978 Masina et al 1999 Grodsky et al     T he  dom i na nt  c ha r a c t e r i s t i c s  of  T I W s  a r e  1000 320 2000 km wavelengths 20 320  40 day periods and 0.3 320 0.5 m/s phase speeds with faster speeds in the Pacific than in the Atlantic e.g., Qiao and Weisberg, 1995; Chelton et al., 2000; Polito et al 2001   T h e s t r o n g er  s h ear  o f  eq u at o r i al  cu r r en t s  i n  t h e Pacific results in more energetic TIWs, whereas TIWs are less energetic in the Atlantic due to weaker current shear. TIWs are stronger to the n orth of the equatorial cold tongues in the Pacific and Atlantic in association with stronger shear in the northern edge of the cold tongues In the Pacific TIWs are most active during boreal fall and winter when the equatorial current shear is largest. Du ring El Ni\226o when the cold tongue is weak or entirely disappears, TIWs are suppressed. During La Ni\226a when the cold tongue and the related current shear are intense, TIWs become unusually vigorous. TIWs are found to play important roles in ocean dynamics  e.g Baturin and Niiler 1997 Grodsky et al 2005 Jochum and Murtugudde 2006 Menkes et al 2006 Kim et al   oc e a n atmosphere coupling [Xie et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2000; Chelton et al 2001 Yu and Liu 2003   an d  m ar i n e b i o g eo ch em i s t r y  e g Feely et al 1994 Gorgues et al 2005 Evans et al    TIWs have been detecte d in various satellite measure ments of the ocean, most nota bly in SST  e.g., Legeckis, 1977; Chelton  et al., 2000   T h e S S T  p at t er n  as s o ci at ed  w i t h  t h e T I W s  af f ect s  the atmospheric boundary layer and modulates ocean surface wind as observed by scatterometers [e.g., Xie et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2000; Chelton et al., 2001; Polito et al., 2001; Hashizume e t al 2001 Yu and Liu 2003  T h e  T I W  p a tte r n  is  a ls o  identifiable  in SSHA  e.g., Polito et al., 2001 a n d  c h l o ro p h y l l a chl a e.g Yoder et al 1994 Strutton et al 2001 McClain et al 2002   W i t h  t h e  a d v e n t  o f  s a t e l l i t e  s a l i n i t y  measurements it is now possible to analyze the salinity signature associated with TIWs This provides a significant new capability to the scope of TIW observations that has important implications to ocean circulation and climate

Lee and his team used the Aquarius data to provide a space borne analysis of SSS structure associated with TIWs aided by a multi sensor characterization of TIWs using other satellite derived prod ucts of SST, ocean surface currents, SSHA, ocean surface wind, and chl a  Figure 3 is an example showing the comparison of satellite observations of SSS SST surface currents SSHA ocean surface wind and chl a in the central to eastern tropical Pacific  The maps for SSS, SST, SSHA, wind speed, and chl a are 7 day averages centered on December 18 whereas the surface currents are 10 day average \(the average of two 5 day records\centered on December 18. The TIW pattern is clearly seen in SSS color shading  in Figures 3a 320 3d The SSS signature of TIWs aligns with that of SST contour in Figure 3a with the northward protrusion of higher SSS coinciding with that of lower SST. The well observed cusp  shaped pattern in SST is also evident in SSS, though not as  sharp as the SST cusps given lower resolution and smoothing of the SSS data Between the cusps there are clockwise  rotating patterns of surface curr ents \(vectors in Figure 3 b\ that also have a strong signature in SSHA contours in Figure 3c indicating  a significant contribution by geo  strophic flow These are features consistent with the anticyclonic vortices associated with TIWs that are sometimes referred to as tropical instability vortices [e.g., Flament et al   A s an early application of Aq uarius data to study dynamic features of the ocean observations of SSS by Aquarius provide d  the first space borne observations of the salinity structure associated with TIWs in the tropical Pacific The observed salinity stru cture of the TIWs is complemen tary to other satellite data such as SST, SSHA, surface cur rent, ocean surface wind, and chl a. Different from SST and SSHA, where the largest signals of TIWs are found a few degrees north of the equator the SSS signature of TIWs is strongest near the equ ator in the eastern equatorial Pacific where saltier South Pacific water meets fresher Inter tropical Convergence Zone water. The magnitude of SSS anomaly associa ted with TIWs is approximately 0.5 PSU larger in he east and smaller in the west The domina nt westward propagation speed is 1 m/s which is twice as fast as the 0.5 m/s TIW phase speed widely reported in the literature mostly based on observations of SST and SSHA away from the equator This is attributed to the more dominant 17 day TIWs near the  equator that have a 1 m/s dominant phase speed and the stronger 33 day TIWs away from the equator that have a 0.5 m/s dominant phase speed The Aquarius data provide a clear view of the salinity structure of the 17 day TIWs for the first time from space  Previous studies suggest that TIWs affect meridional transports of water properties specifically with regards to temperature and biology The SSS signature of TIWs as revealed by Aquarius indicates that TIWs are likely to play an important role in hemisph eric exchange of salt and freshwater, which on the longer time scales may influence the ocean circulation and hydrological cycle The observed SSS signature of TIWs comp lements in situ salinity obser vations by Argo floats which have inadequate sampling to  resolve TIWs The Aquarius data also provide additional constraints to models and as similation products in simulat ing TIWs and their consequences  Another interesting finding is found from the data from SSS  measurements from  Aquarius/SAC D satellite and S MOS  mission.  Measurements were used to document the freshening associated with the record 2011 Mississippi River flooding event in the Gulf of Mexico \(GoM\. Assessment of the salinity response was aided by additional satellite observations including chlo rophyll a \(chl a\ and ocean surface currents, and a passive tracer simulation Low SSS values associated with the spreading of the river plume were observed 1 320 3 months after peak river discharge which then receded and became unidentifiable from satellite o bservations 5 months after maximum discharge The seasonal wind pattern and general circulation of the GoM dramatically impacted the observed salinity response transporting freshwater eastward along the Gulf coast and entraining low salinity waters into t he open GoM The observed salinity response from Aquarius was consistent with SMOS SSS chl a concentrations and the

Higher con centrations of nutrients, sedime nts, and dissolved organic mat ter accompany freshwater discharge providing a major source of material into the GoM Such nutrient input from the Mississippi River has been a ssociated with enhanced chlo rophyl l a chl a concentrations and primary productivity in the northern GoM Lohrenz et al 1997; Rabalais et al   S out he r l y s out he a s t e r l y w i nds  a r e  prevalent during spring and summer months when Mississippi River discharge is maximal driving an eastw ard along shelf current that trans  ports freshwater, nutrients, chl a, sediments and dissolved or  ganic matter over the narrow Mississippi Alabama Florida shelf Morey et al 2003a 2003b   A  narrower shelf and deeper waters near the shelf edge permit floodwaters to inter  act with the general circulation of the GoM  In the GoM the ocean circulation is dominated by the Loop Current LC and its associated warm core anticyclonic and cold core cyclonic eddies   The position of the LC fluctuates within  the GoM but its most northward position occurs prior to shedding a large warm core eddy, which happens every 3 to 17 months Zavala Hidalgo et al 2006   T h e  L C  a n d  i t s  associated eddies remain offshore of the continental shelf, but can force exchanges of fluid across the continental shelf break These interactions are observed as plumes of water that have dif ferent properties than the sur rounding environment. Several studies have shown plumes of low salinity chlorophyll rich waters in the open GoM alo ng the West Florida Shelf and even as far as the Florida Straits and Gulf Stream linked to river discharge in the GoM i.e Mississippi Mobile and Apalachicola Rivers Ortner et al 1995 Gilbes et al 1996 Del Castillo et al 2001   S u c h  r i v e r  d i scharge studies primarily use a combination of satellite and in situ data but mainly rely upon satellite derived estimates of chl a sediments, and dissolved organic matter, rather than freshwater estimates from limited in situ salinity observations to c haracterize river plumes and describe their spatial and temporal variability  The  advent  of  satellite  salinity  measurements  provides a unique opportunity to analyze river discharge ev ents using global SSS  distributions. Aquarius/SAC D has been pro viding gl obal SSS maps on a weekly basis since late August 2011. The  SMOS  has also been providing global maps of SSS at a  10 day interval since 2010 As indicated earlier r ecent research has demonstrated the value of Aquarius data in studying large scale dynamic o cean features such as TIW  in the Pacific Lagerloef et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012  t h e  u s e  o f  S M O S  d a t a  in capturing seasonal features of the freshwater pool in the eastern Pacific Alory et al 2012   an d  t h e ap p l i cat i o n  o f  Aquarius and SMOS data to st udy the large plume of the Amazon/Orinoco River in the western tropical Atlantic Grodsky et al 2012  H o w e v e r  i t  re m a i n s  u n c l e a r a s  t o  whether Aquarius and SMOS data can be used to study salinity variation in marginal seas, such as Mississippi River di scharge in the GoM. This is primarily because of the smaller scales of salinity features in marginal seas and t he potential contami nation of the SSS signal near land such as radio frequency interference RFI and land effects on antenna sidelobes Subrahm anyam et al 2013   T h e l en g t h  o f  t h e Aquarius and SMOS satellite records currently limit the number of flood events that can be investigated Of the years available, 2011 was a record breaking flood year in the central United States comparable to major flood events in 1927 and 1993 Widespread flooding was attributed to excessive precipitation from major storm systems in combinatio n with extensive snowmelt T hey  demonstrate the applicability of Aquarius and SMOS data to  observe SSS freshening associ ated with the extreme Mississippi River flooding event in 2011, and assess the transit time of the associated low SSS signal in the GoM aided by multisensor characterization using other satellite derived products such as ocean surface currents and chl a  Aquarius and SMOS SSS data were used along with satellite derived chl a and ocean surface current products to study the salinity freshening associated with the record 2011 Mississippi River flooding event in the GoM. A time series of USGS daily mean disch arge revealed maximum flooding of the Mississippi River in May 2011. In asso  ciation with this discharge event SSS freshening was observed from June to August 2011 \(1 320 3 months after peak discharge\ in the GoM that then receded and became unidentifiable f rom satellite observations by October 2011 5  months after peak discharge\. Seasonal wind patterns and the general circulation of the GoM dramatically impacted the observed salinity response Specifically prevalent southerly/southeasterly winds drove an e astward along shelf current from May to September 2011 that transported freshwater along the Mississippi Alabama  Florida shelf. From June to September 2011, freshwater interacted with the LC and its associated mesoscale eddy field specifically a warm cor e eddy that was shed in the July 320 September time frame Low SSS values were entrained and transported along the eastern periphery of the LC and warm core eddy and were transported out of the GoM by October 2011 The observed salinity response from Aquarius  was consistent with SMOS SSS observations and MODIS chl a concentrations in terms of the pathway and transit time of the river plume spreading A passive tracer simulation confirmed the pathway and transit time of freshwater spreading observed by Aquarius  and SMOS in the GoM. This study is the first successful demonstration of the utility of Aquarius and SMOS data to study the salinity

Its passage left a 1.5 psu high haline wake covering >10 5 km 2 in its impact on density the equivalent of a 3.5 o C cooling\ due to mixing of the shallow BL. Destruction of this BL apparently decreased SST cooli ng in the plume and thus preserved higher SST and  evaporation than outside Com bined with SST the new satellite SSS data provide a new and better tool to monitor the plume extent and quantify tropical cyclone upper ocean responses with important implicat ions for forecasting  Because of the importance of latent heat release as an energy source hurricane strength depends  on changes in the underlying ocean thermal stratification [e.g., Shay et al., 2000; Saunders and Lea, 2008   Intense hurricane induced mi xing and upwelling act to entrain cool thermocline water into the mixed layer, leaving behind a cool wake of SST depressed by a few degrees, which reduces hurricane growth potential [e.g., Price, 1981; Bender and Ginis 2000  Zhu and Zhang      Passage  over freshwater plumes generally causes strengthening of hurricanes due to high SST Ffield 2007 Vizy and Cook   a nd m i ni m i z a t i on of  t he  c ool  w a ke  due  t o t he  pr e s e nc e  of the BL [Sengupta et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2011; Balaguru et al 2012   T h es e produce nearly 50 increase in intensification rate over BL regions and occur in 10 320 20 of tropical cyclone cases worldwide Balaguru et al 2012  b u t are more probable 68 for the most intense category 5 hurricanes Ffield   T hey  combine new ly available SSS from the Aquarius/SAC D and SMOS missions together with other in situ and remote sensing observations to explore the impact of the Amazon/Orinoco plume on spatial and temporal sig  natures of SSS and SST after the passage of hurricane Kati a in fall 2011 They  expect that new ability to map the plume more precisely with satellite SSS will benefit hurricane forecasting when it is evident that the trajectory will intersect the plume at some stage   Unlike SST widely available from remote sensing SSS is relatively sparse and its response to passing storms is often overlooked Recognition of the impact of hurricane on a BL goes back at least to sample profile observations of Price 1981 s h o w i n g  t h e  b reakdown of a BL in the Gulf of Mexico A similar Argo record was presented by McPhaden et al 2009 i n  t h e  B a y  o f  B e n g a l   B u t   c o m p a re d  t o  A R G O  o r moorings the satellite SSS now enables tracking the spatial variability of SSS induced by hurricanes in an  unprecedented manner  The  hurricane  season  in  the  Atlantic  extends  fromearly June through the end of November with a peak in late August  early September. The most intense hurricanes, according to the National Hurricane Center NHC form off the Cape V erde Islands in the eastern basin in fall growing as they progress westward across the warm SSTs. In 2011, the first of two Cape Verde hurricanes and the second hurricane of the season began as tropical storm Katia in late August Katia reached a Catego ry 1 on September 1 with minimum central pressure of P min  988 mb and the radius of sustained hurricane force winds R  55 km By the afternoon of September 4 Katia rea ched a Category 2 maximum sus tained winds 44 m/s P min 961mb, and R = 75 km\. By t he evening of September 5 after passing over the freshwater plume Katia had strengthened to a Category 4 \(winds >60 m/s, P min 942mb and R = 95 km\. Twenty  four hours later, Katia  weakened to a Category 1. T hey  examine the response of the upper ocean to the passage of Katia as it appears in the in situ and satellite records  About  68  of  hurricanes  that  finally  reached  category 5 have  crossed the Amazon/Orinoco plume Ffield 2007  w h er e t h e presence of BL can enhance their growth rate by 50  Balaguru  et al 2012   T h ey  present a case study of the passage of hurricane Katia over the plume for which an extensive array of remote sensed and in situ observations are available, in particular new SSS from SMOS and Aquarius. A similarly strong haline wake ev ent was detected with SMOS alone following hurricane Igor in Septem ber 2010  The availability of SSS from both SMOS and Aquarius reinforces these first observations and demonstrates spatial and temporal patterns of hurricane BL interactions in an unpreced ented manner They  find that both Igor and Katia forced SSS changes 1 psu over an area exceeding 10 5 km 2 These abrupt changes last and have implications for SSS climate since SSS is not damped like SST  These observations confirm that over the plume a u niform density mixed layer is shallower than uniform temperature layer because of stable halocline, acting to inhibit cooling and vertical mixing Under an intense hurri cane the halocline which is above the thermocline, is mixed first. This produces a SSS  wake that is by a few psu saltier than initial SSS in the plume From space time diagrams of SSS and SST along the hurricane track they  find that haline wake develops only within the plume and is associated with at least 0.5 o C weaker SST cooling than outs ide the plume. This difference in SST cooling is explained by additional work required to mix the BL. Thus BL leads to a reduction in hurricane induced surface cooling that favors hurricane development as the result ing elevated SST and high evap oration en hance the hurricane\325s maximum potential intensity  The geographic location and seasonality of the Amazon/Orinoco plume make hurricane overpasses a not  


 10  infrequent occurrence Indeed the expansion of the plume in August September coincides with the peak of  the production of Cape Verde hurricanes, a group that  includes many of the most intense Category 4 320 5 hurricanes Thus the results presented strongly suggest that the salinity stratification role in mixed layer dynamics should be taken into account when forecasting hurricane growth over the plume The availability of satellite SSS from Aquarius and SMOS along with in situ ARGO measurements is critical to making such model improvements practical  Another notable observation is t he Madden Julian Oscillation  MJO  that  impacts a wide range of weather and climate phenomena. Current global coupled ocean atmospheric general circulation models exhibit considerable shortcomings in representing and predicting the MJO, specifically its initiation due to a lack of i n si tu observations. F or the first time, the MJO propagation can be detect ed from the data from Aquarius. The magnitude and extent of SSS  variations during the MJO is established providing a useful tool for data assimilation into models to correctly repre sent both oceanic and atmospheric processes during intraseasonal variations Salinity observation allows for atmospheric conditions to be inferred from freshwater flux, on which surface salinity is highly dependent Increased observations of global SSS fro m the Aquarius mission will be particularly valuable in remote regions of the tropics and will increase the  dynamical understanding and advance prediction of the MJO through model improvement  On the intraseasonal scale the dominant mode of climate variab ility known as  the MJO  Madden and Julian 1971 affects the tropics through strong air sea coupling Wang and Xie 1998 Fu et al 2003  a n d  i n f l u e n c e s  m a n y  g l o b a l  meteorological phenomena Bond and Vecchi 2003 Matthews 2004 Maloney and Hartmann 200    T he  convective anomalies propagate eastward at an average speed of 5 ms _1 and typically cover 12,000 320 20,000km of the equatorial belt Rui and Wang 1990   T h e m ech an i s m s  t h at  produce the MJO breakdown into two hypotheses 1 The MJO is a response to a  pre existing forcing, and \(2\ the MJO is sustained by its own energy source through coupl ed circulation patterns there fore accurate initial conditions are vitally important for intraseasonal prediction Fu et al 2011  W ith  the increasing availability of satellite and in situ observations the dynamics of the MJO will be better und erstood and the dynamic predic tion will improve  SSS responds to freshwater flux precipitation minus evaporation and wind driven advection making it an ideal variable to ut ilize when understanding the response of the ocean to atmospheric processes during the MJO [Matthews et al 2010 Grunseich et al 2011   P o s i t i v e S S S  an o m al i es  ar e produced during periods of enhanced winds and clear skies positive Outgoing Longwave Rad iation OLR anom  alies which increase evaporation. Enhanced precipitation and cloud cover \(negative OLR anomalies\, combined with a reduction in winds, lead to a reduction in salinity anoma  lies. Additionally advection can produce salinity anomalies  especially in tropical regions of the Indian Ocean where the horizontal salinity gradients are strong  Besides being a variable that responds passively to at mospheric conditions, SSS significantly controls upper ocean density and therefore the Mixed Layer  Depth MLD The formation of a Barrier Layer the layer between the MLD and Isothermal Layer Depth can lead to possible feedbacks that impact the atmospheric component of the MJO as stated as one of the three major hypotheses of the Dynamics of the Mad den Julian Oscillation \(DYNAMO\ field campaign. This layer produces a stable stratification, reducing vertical mixing, which influences surface heat fluxes and thus could possibly impact atmospheric conditions during the MJO Establishing the magnitude and  extent of SSS variations during the MJO will be a useful tool for data a ssimilation into models to cor rectly represent both oceanic thermodynamic characteristics and atmospheric processes during intraseasonal variations  In this study they  show fo r the f irst time the SSS varia tions measured from the Aquarius salinity mission that occur during the MJO and identify the mechanisms that produce the fluctuations Accurate quantification of SSS  during the MJO will lead to the improvement of models data assimil ation dynamical prediction and most importantly MJO initialization  The atmospheric conditions associated with varying phases of the MJO propagation  are responsible for the devel opment of SSS anomalies  This study examines the magni tude and extent of s alinity variations at the surface during the MJO using satellite derived data. Previous studies such as Matthews et al 2010 u t i l i z e  A rg o  o b s e rv a t i o n s  t o  e x p l a i n  h o w  t h e  M J O  modulates salinity Unlike Aquarius which measures salinity directly at the sur face, Argo measurements are taken from 5 to 10 m depth \(10 dbar\. When compared with their  results, SSS anomalies during the development of the convective phase appear to be less pronounced in the Argo data. This is possibly du e to the weak atmospheric for c ing that exists during this phase having little impact on the depth where the observations are taken When the convection is strongest in the Eastern Ind ian Ocean their  results are con sistent in showing the produc tion of negative salinity anom alies but in the western Pacific Ocean Argo data show contrasting negative salinit y anomalies During the produc tion of positive OLR anomalies in the Indian Ocean both studies show positive salinity anomalies, but in the western Pacific Ocean, dissimilar results a ppear These comparisons indicate that salinity variability during the MJO in the Western Pacific Ocean requires additional study in the future  The ability of Aquarius to accurately detect the variations in SSS during different stages of the MJO propagati on shows that it will be a useful tool in understanding MJO dynamics The MJO related SSS  variations have only been shown in model simulations Grunseich et al 2011  a n d  sa t e l l i t e  st u d i e s utilizing additional oceanic parameters to understand the dynamics  are only beginning Grunseich and Subrahmanyam    A na l ys i s  of  S S S  s i m ul a t i ons  f r om  H ybr i d C oor di na t e  Ocean Model output revealed that high resolution ocean

It has now been shown that the measurements gathered from thi s mission will broaden the  understanding in various modes of climate variability even on intraseasonal scales  VI  FUTURE  WORK  This year is expected to yield significant scientific discoveries for satellite salinity measurements A landmark collection of research papers will address early scientific results of the mission and include many aspects of how rainfall, evaporation river outflows and melting ice are linked to salinity ocean current and climate variations  The satellite salinity data are now bei ng tested in numerical ocean mod els that are used for ocean forecasting will soon be used to enhance the skill of long term climate prediction models  The SPURS measurements will conclude in September, and the science teams will focus on data analysis stu dying the relationships between the in situ observations and the satellite salinity data  In the future a second SPURS may be carried out in an area that is dominated by intense annual rainfall in direct contrast to the arid region of the first survey i n order to fully understand ocean processes that regulate the reduced surface salinities and climatic changes in those regions as well  At the end of 2014 Aquarius will complete a baseline three year mission designed to measure the seasonal cycle and inte r annual climate variability Provided that the onboard systems continue to work as needed NASA and CONAE  plan to maintain the mission operations into the future and continue to gather this important new data set for studying ocean dynamics, climate chang e and the global water cycle  VII  SUMMARY  The global map generated from Aquarius data clearly shows the predomin ant and well known climatologi cal ocean salinity features such as higher salinity in the subtropics higher average salinity in the Atlantic Ocean compared to  the Pacific and Indian oceans and lower salinity in rainy belts near the equator in the northe rnmost Pacific Ocean and else where These features are related to large  scale patterns of rainfall and evaporation over the ocean  river outflow and ocean cir culation Th e values depicted in the South ern Ocean retain significant uncertainties associated with high winds and low surface temperatures that complicate the retrieval processing  Other important regional features are clearly evident, inclu ding a contrast between the arid, high salinity Arabian Sea west of the Indian subcontinent and the low salinity Bay of Bengal to the east, which is dominated by the Ganges River and southern Asia monsoon rains The data also reveal important smaller detai ls such as pro minent low salinity water asso ciated with outflow from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers Aquarius will monitor how these various larger  and smaller sc ale fea tures change over time and provide data to study their link to climate and weather var iations  Aquarius  also reveals considerable sur face salinity variation at much smaller scales than expected  In the global maps produced to date the  lower salinity region coincides with the zonal heavy precip itation band in the Intertropi cal Convergence Zone. The current vectors reveal meandering and eddy features associ ated with the salinity patterns. Such detail of surface dynamical structure is not resolved with the conventional salinity observations emphasizing the new capabilities now avail able for studying the ocean and new disco v eries that are in store  Algori thm updates and data reprocess ing will b e frequent and unscheduled dur ing the firs t year.
