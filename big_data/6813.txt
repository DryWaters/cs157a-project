In this paper we present a secured key management protocol \(SecCOSEN\ adopted on COSEN, a chain oriented sensor network, which is used for periodic data collection.

SecCOSEN shows high resilience to different security attacks. The protocol outperforms other random key predistribution protocols in the sense that it requires lower space, lower communication overhead and offers very high session key candidates  1. Introduction  Security is one of the key concerns for wireless sensor networks \(WSN\owadays. This is because of the envisioned growth in utilizing sensor networks in a wide variety of applications ranging from hospitals or emergencies to battle fields. Most of the usage areas of WSN are sensitive and thus prone to different kinds of 
attacks. A secured key management protocol is the prerequisite for a secured WSN Key management is the process by which cryptographic keys are generated, stored, protected, transferred loaded, used, and destroyed. The main objective of key management is to establish and maintain secure channels among communicating parties. Typically, key management schemes use administrative keys for the secure and efficient \(re-\distribution and, at times, generation of the secure channel communication keys to the communicating parties. Communication keys may be pair-wise keys used 
to secure a communication channel between two nodes that are in direct or indirect communications h e y  may be group keys shared by multiple nodes [6, 7   Network keys \(both administrative and communication keys\ may need to be changed \(re-keyed\ to maintain secrecy and resilience to attacks, failures, or network topology changes Key management entails the basic functions of analysis assignment, generation, and distribution [6, 7, 21  D u r i ng  key analysis, keying requirements are analysed to 
determine the required number of keys for the network as well as the number of keys needed by each node. Key assignment refers to the mapping of keys to different parties. In the next step generation of administrative keys may take place once or multiple times over the lifespan of the network. The generation of communication keys is the responsibility of the communicating parties. In all cases the key generating node\(s\ must be trusted by all keyreceiving nodes. In static key pre-distribution schemes administrative keys are generated by a key server and 
loaded into nodes prior to deployment [2 T h e last step  key distribution, refers to the delivery of keys to their designated nodes after they have been generated and assigned to the nodes. The distribution of communication keys usually takes place after the network has been deployed. Communication keys are used for a short period of time and should be regularly updated of network keys In this paper we propose a secured key management protocol which can be adopted on COSEN ai n  oriented data collection protocol for WSN.  It is shown in  at C O S E N ou tperf o r m s ot 
her hierarchical protocols like LEAC d P E GASIS [9] in  both th e cas es of  energy consumption and time requirements respectively The key management scheme presented here is based on partial key pre-distribution and uses symmetric key for encryption and decryption  2. Related works  Traditionally the four basic functions, discussed in section I, have been tightly coupled, where all of them were performed by a centralized server or collaboratively by the nodes in a network, with each node performing the same functions. Recent proposals, e.g., [2, 5, 6  ha ve  
moved to decouple these functions to various degrees Such decoupling can immensely benefit sensor networks due to their large scale, high vulnerability to attacks, and limited resources Several key distribution schemes have been proposed in WSN. Key management schemes in sensor networks 


can be classified broadly into dynamic t at i c 2, 3  o l u t i o n s bas e d on w h e t h e r rek e y i n g u pdat e   administrative keys is enabled post network deployment Schemes can also be classified into homogeneous [2, 3, 5  or heterogeneous [24 sc he me s w i t h r e ga r d t o t h e r o l e o f  network nodes in the key management process. All nodes in a homogeneous scheme perform the same functionality on the other hand, nodes in a heterogeneous scheme are assigned different roles. Homogeneous schemes generally assume a flat network model, while heterogeneous schemes are intended for both flat and clustered networks Other classification criteria include whether nodes are anonymous or have pre-deployment knowledge \(location degree of hostility, etc.\ imparted to the nodes. Another classification criteria includes asymmetric \(public key cryptography or symmetric cryptography. Although there are some works done in [10, 11, 12 t o cu s t om i ze pu bl i c  key cryptography and elliptic key cryptography for lowpower devices, such approaches are still considered as costly due to high processing requirements. The last classification criterion includes pre-distribution [2, 3, 5, 14 17, 19, 24 or pos t  di s t ri bu t i o n of s ecret k e y s R ece n t  research suggests that symmetric secret key predistribution is possibly the only practical approach for establishing secure channels among sensor nodes  Eschenauer and Gligor [2 r o p o s ed a p r o b ab ilistic k e y  pre-distribution technique to bootstrap the initial trust between sensor nodes.

Overview of COSEN  In COSEN, all the sensors make up several fixedlength chains. A leader is selected in each chain. Sensor data are aggregated and routed along the chains towards the leader of the chain. One of the chain-leaders then collects the aggregated data and sends it to the BS The architecture of COSEN protocol can be described in two phases: \(i\ain formation phase and \(ii collection and transmission phase. During the chain formation phase several chains called lower-level chain s are formed including all the live nodes in the network and then a lower-level leader is selected in each chain based on some criteria. These lower-level leader s in turn form a higher-level chain from which a single leader called higher-level leader is finally selected depending on some  Figure 1.  Data and token passing in a chain    parameters to transmit to the Base Station BS the other hand, data collection and transmission phase includes the node level data collection, data aggregation and the final transmission of information to remote BS A detailed description of the two phases can be found at  At the beginning of each round, each leader in a lowerlevel chain sends a token towards the one end indicating the beginning of data transmission phase. Node at one end of the chain sends its data toward the leader node through intermediate nodes as shown in figure 1   4. SecCOSEN  The key management protocol SecCOSEN is based on partial keys pre-distribution and symmetric cryptography On account of resource-constraint nature of sensor network both pre-distribution of keys and symmetric cryptography are appropriate with WSN. Furthermore, we do not assign keys randomly from a key-pool as in [2, 14  Co nse q ue nt l y  number of keys generated is much lower when compared with [2, 14  N o ne t h e l e ss t h e  ke y  ma na ge me nt  s y st e m  remains secure because large number of keys can be generated by the sensors participating in a chain and each pair of sensor nodes uses different communication key Another important feature of the scheme is that two communicating nodes always use a new secret key for data encryption/decryption in each round. This feature enables WSN to achieve resilience to attacks as well as data freshness without generating a long nonce. The scheme is depicted in figure 3 We propose each of the sensors keeps a set of partial key rather than the set of full keys. This has a two-fold advantages – i\er storage requirement and ii\en if a sensor is captured by an attacker, it cannot obtain the encryption/decryption keys. Two neighboring sensors establish their encryption/decryption key concatenating their partial keys  A key pool of partial keys is generated at the base station prior to the deployment of sensors. The size of the key pool is an important factor to be considered. If we consider that an encryption/decryption key should be 32 bits long and the key pool contains 1000 partial keys of 16 bits long, the total memory consumption for storing all the partial keys in a sensor is \(\(32/2\1000\bits or 2KB. It should be noted that, the Berkeley Mica Motes \(one of the 


oldest sensors\ has 128K bytes of program storage, and 4K bytes of SRAM. Although SecCOSEN forces each sensor node to consume all the partial keys generated at BS soon after the first chain formation phase a sensor can delete all the partial keys except the nominated keys for it. Thus if a sensor stores 50 half keys, it requires only 100 bytes to store the partial keys. Note that, using n partial keys, two neighboring nodes can establish up to 2 2 n secret session keys. Number of session key candidates is one of the important performance evaluations metric. Number of session key candidates simply refers to the minimum number of session keys possibly being created for data encryption/decryption In SecCOSEN different notations and conventions are used. They are provided in figure 2. Now, before deployment, each sensor is loaded with key pool of partial keys P list of identifiers of the partial keys L a single network key NK and a unique identifier ID Note that, if a key pool contains  number of partial keys  2 log  bits require identifying each of the partial keys. Thus a sensor node is loaded with around 2.7KB of partial keys and their identifiers. Soon after the chain formation each node requires 144 bytes \(assuming each node keeps 50 partial keys and deletes the rest\he single network key and the unique identifier of each node are used for distributing the administrative keys securely and authentication purposes respectively During the chain formation phase of COSEN SecCOSEN authenticates each sensor in a chain. Most of the sensor networks are used to protect or monitor critical infrastructures. In such structural monitoring applications it would be a reasonable assumption that the sensor field is under super surveillance only during the deployment phase which usually does not last too long [18  T h at is w e  assume that adversaries do not actively catch or attack individual sensor nodes in this phase because otherwise they would run a high risk of exposing themselves. That’s why we assume a single network key is sufficient in early deployment phase. However, an adversary might send strong signals as HELLO messages to tempt a sensor to consider it as its neighbour and thus become a member of a chain. For this reason, we propose a three-tier authentication check after forming a chain. All members of the chain send their ID s \(encrypted by the network key\ to the leader of the chain. After collecting all the ID s, the local-leader sends all the ID s along with its own ID to the BS for authentication. If BS authenticates each member of the chain, it randomly chooses a predetermined number of partial keys and constructs an LPK please refer to fig 2 using the id s of those partial keys BS then sends the LPK   encrypted by the network key\ to the lower-level leader of he chain. The lower-level leader then disseminates the LPK  encrypted by the network key\ in the same fashion described  in  figure  1. Once  sensor node  comes  to know   Figure 2. Notations and conventions   which partial keys it will use with its neighbor, it deletes rest of the partial keys and their corresponding id s Now the sensor nodes are responsible for establishing communication keys. In COSEN, a sensor node being a non-leader, only communicates its neighbor towards the lower-level leader of the chain. Furthermore, all the nodes of a chain share the same list of partial keys. To establish communication keys with its neighbor, a node A creates an order list  A O which maintains the same cardinality with LPK but the order of the id s are different, and sends it encrypted by the network key\ to its neighbor B  B sends a similar order list B O to A Now both A and B can construct secret keys for each round as depicted in figure 3 In the higher-level chain, the lower-level leaders can construct their session keys in a similar way if they share some common partial keys. This can be done by the BS when assigning LPK s.  It should keep some common partial keys in each LPK such that the local-level leaders can construct a secure communication key among themselves.

Figure 3.  SecCOSEN protocol   5. Discussion and evaluation  The first thing to consider, while designing a routing protocol and imposing security constraint upon it , is the number of messages to accomplish security measures in a routing protocol. In order to reduce the total number of messages sent and thus save energy, sensor readings from multiple nodes may be processed at one of many possible aggregation points. An aggregation point collects sensor readings from surrounding nodes and forwards a single message representing an aggregate of the values Aggregation points are typically regular sensor nodes, and their selection is not necessarily static. Aggregation points could be chosen dynamically for each query or event, for example. It is also possible that every node in the network functions as an aggregation point, delaying transmission of an outgoing message until a sufficient number of incoming messages have been received and aggregated. Note that COSEN choses the later one. Also note that in SecCOSEN two neighbours are not required to send messages to get each secret key  Pre-distribution Before deployment, each sensor is loaded with i  a pool of  partial keys P  PK 1 PK 2 PK k which is generated at BS ii  a list    2 1 id id L    k id that contains an identifier for each of the keys of key pool P such that n n PK id L    for 1  n 2, 3 k  iii  a network key NK  iv  a unique identification number i ID for i 1, 2, 3 N  Chain formation phase At the end of each chain i C  i 1, 2 n ormed, its member nodes send encrypted ID s to the Local-leaderLC i   A LC i    A NK ID E where i C A   Local-leaderLC i  collects all the ID s and then sends them along with its own ID to the base station for authentication LC i  BS  NK E i A ID i i C A   i LC ID  Following authentication base station sends encrypted list of id s nominated for chain C i  BS   LC i    i NK LPK E  Receiving the LPK i  LC i disseminates LPK i to all member nodes of the chain using the same fashion depicted in Fig. 1 Now each sensor member of the chain deletes the partial keys that are not mapped by LPK i from P to find out its key list  i KL     x id L P  i x LPK id   Data collection phase To establish an encryption/decryption key, two sensor nodes A and B where i C A    i C B  follows   A   B       i A NK A NK LPK R E O E  where A R  is a random function that changes the order of the elements remaining the cardinality same   B   A       i B NK B NK LPK R E O E     Now both A and B compute the secret key for the first round as         t O L t O L K B A t AB  where || means concatenation and   t O A  returns the t th id of O A For the next round A and B compute the secret key as  1     1    1     t O L t O L K B A t AB and so on 


Power management in sensor networks is also critical At full power, the Berkeley Mica mote can run for only two weeks or so before exhausting its batteries Consequently, if we want sensor networks to last for years it is crucial that they run at around a 1% duty cycle \(or less\. Similarly, since the power consumption of the radio is three orders of magnitude higher when transmitting or listening than when in sleep mode, it is crucial to keep the radio in sleep mode the overwhelming majority of the time. Also, communication bandwidth is extremely dear each bit transmitted consumes about as much power as executing 800–1000 instructions d as a  consequence, any message expansion caused by security mechanisms comes at significant cost. That’s why we emphasise on calculating the future secret keys by collecting the order list from a sensor’s neighbour, rather than sending and receiving partial keys in each round Besides these, we consider several evaluation metrics namely \(i\umber of session key candidates \(ii\ility iii\ey connectivity \(iv\ resilience \(v\rage complexity vi\sing complexity and \(vii\mmunication complexity to evaluate SecCOSEN Number of session key candidates simply refers to the minimum number of session keys possibly being created for data encryption/decryption. Figure 6 shows the exponential increase of session key domain with respect to the number of partial key assigned to a node. This means that finding out a secret key even knowing the LPK of a chain is impossible Scalability is the ability to support larger networks Larger networks can be supported if there is enough storage for the required security credentials which is related to storage complexity of the solution. Figure 6 also implicitly shows the scalability performance of SecCOSEN. Every sensor needs only 100 partial keys to store \(which requires only 325 bytes \e of the 20,000 session keys can be generated for a large sensor network Resilience can be defined in one of the following ways i\robability that a link is compromised when an adversary captures a node, \(ii\umber of nodes whose security credentials are compromised when an adversary captures a node, or \(iii\umber of sensor nodes required to be captured to compromise whole WSN. Third one is represented as n-secure meaning that it is enough to capture n 1 nodes to compromise whole WSN. As these values increase, network becomes less secure; therefore resilience decreases. Note that in SecCOSEN, even if an adversary captures a node it cannot find out the encryption/decryption key as all the keys that remain in a sensor node are partial keys rather than full secret key Key connectivity, the most important factor for random key pre-distribution schemes, considers the probability that two \(or more\ensor nodes store the same key or keying material to be able to establish pair-wise, group-wise or network-wise keys. Note that in SecCOSEN all the members of a chain share the same LPK therefore share the same partial keys. Thus connectivity is always guaranteed in this scheme Efficiency of the solutions is generally measured with their storage, processing and communication complexities Storage complexity is the amount of memory units required to store security credentials. It is shown beforehand that SecCOSEN requires very low storages 144 bytes to preserve 50 partial keys\o keep the partial keys and their identifiers. Figure 5 depicts the memory requirement of SecCOSEN Communication complexity is measured as number and size of packets sent and received by a sensor node. Note that, in SecCOSEN a node communicates with its neighbor using only the identifiers rather than partial keys. Thus the packet size is relatively low Resilience against node capturing is defined as the percentage of secure links that are compromised after a certain number of nodes are captured by adversaries SecCOSEN shows a high resilience as the candidate key domain exponentially increases with the linear increase of number of partial keys  Besides these, we examined all the security attacks up on SecCOSEN and found that the scheme handles each and every security attack. These could not be discussed here due to page restrictions  6. Conclusion  In this paper, we first proposed the notion of predistribution of partial keys for secured key management scheme and then proposed the detailed protocol to employ this on a chain oriented data collection sensor network COSEN. Each sensor node establishes a pair-wise secret key for data encryption and decryption. The protocol outperforms other random key pre-distribution protocols in the sense that it requires lower space \(due to partial keys rather than full keys stored in each sensor\er communication overhead \(as path-key establishment phase is absent in this protocol\d offers very high session key candidates   0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 1 5 0 15 0 250 350 45 0 550 6 50 75 0 85 0 950 10 5 0 11 5 0 1 25 0 1 35 0 14 5 0 ke y pool size security level  Figure 4.

Expression yields true, and a False Stencil which is selected when the Conditional Expression yields false A sample Stencil is shown in Figure 6 and described in section 4.3 The AAP phase uses the token list of the document to resolve the Stencil, by resolv ing the elements in the Stencil in order. String elements are directly emitted to the output. Future Expressions are evaluated, the result of which then converted to String and sent to the output. For each Branch element, depending on the evaluation result of its Conditional Expression, either the True Stencil or the False Stencil is selected and recursively resolved Note that Future Expressions can only take document token list as input and doesn’t have access to XSLT variables. As a result, if an expression depends on an XSL variable whose value can’t be determined at PreP phase \(because its value is conditionally updated by a conditional element\no transformation optimization for this combination of stylesheet and structure 3.3.5 Compression for Efficient Transmission Efficient transmission of XML documents is particularly important in mobile environments Structure recurrence can be exploited for compression and efficient transmission by avoiding the redundant transmission of structural information and by compressing recurring test nodes and attribute values  Assuming sender S first sends document A to receiver R and later sends to R document B which has the same structure as document A, if S knows that R has locally kept the structure information for A, then S only needs to send the structure identification of B, along with the text node and attribute values of B. Efficiency is achieved by replacing the structure of document B with the \(much shorter\identification of the structure of the document  Further, the text node and attribute values in document A has a 1-to-1 mapping with those in document B. If sender S is aware that receiver R also keeps text node and attribute values of document A, then when S detects that a value in B is the same as the corresponding value in A, S only needs to signal R to reuse the value in A, instead of retransmitting it The combination of the two offers potentially high compression ratio with very low computation overhead Note that it is not necessary for the sender and the receiver to be both aware of the existence of the compression. For example, in wireless mobile environments, the gateway of a mobile device can serve as the proxy between the outside world and the mobile device: XML documents are transmitted in compressed form between a mobile device and its gateway, while the gate way and the outside world communicate in usual text form 4 IMPLEMENTATION We have implemented in Java a XML tokenizer, a DOM-style parser, and a XSLT processor, based on Structure Encoding. The DOM-style parser is implemented as an exten sion to kXML, while the XSLT processor is implemented as an extension to XT 4.1 Tokenizer The tokenizer operates in three different modes  The Swift mode, which is activated when the incoming document contains sender assigned structure ID, and that cached token list for the structure is found  The Hash mode, which is activated when the incoming document does not contain sender assigned structure ID The hash function we use is an implementation of MD5 which generates 128-bit digests  The Nature mode, which is normal XML tokenization and is activated under all other conditions Fi g ure 6. An Exam p le of Transformation Stencil

Under Swift mode, the tokenizer checks each token in the token list, and takes different action depending on the types of the token  If it is a Text token, it reads a text string \(delimited by and may contain entity references\ the document character stream, and uses the text string to replace the value of the token  If it is a Start Element token, the tokenizer first skips a number of characters from the document character stream. The exact number of characters is determined by the length of the name of the element. It then enters a loop that reads attributes of the element. Within the body of the loop, it first checks if the next token is Attribute Name. If it is not, then the processing for the Start Element token completes. Otherwise, it skips the name of the attributes, reads the value of the attribute and updates the value of the next token \(which must be of type Attribute Value  In all other cases, the tokenizer simply skips a number of characters. The exact number of characters is determined by the type of the token and the length of the value of the token In the Nature mode, the tokenizer reads in XML constructs, makes sure that they are syntactically correct, and then converts them into tokens. Operations in Hash mode are mostly the same, except that the tokenizer also needs to send structure characters to the hash function for ID generation 4.2 Structure Encoding Based Parser Figure 7 shows a structure encoding based XML parser. It has three components: The Tokenizer as described above  The Structure Manager, which contains a cache manager that manages the reuse of document trees, and an optional Structure Optimizer, which does tree optimizations described in section 3.3.3  The Controller, which includes an interface with the kXML DOM parser. It also includes a Value Loader which does text node and attribute value reassignments The Controller falls back to kXML DOM parser, by passing to it a SAX parser implemented on top of the tokenizer, when it is unable to get a reusable document tree from the Structure Manager. Each document structure has a mapping table that associates a text node or an attribute value object with a token in the token list. The Value Loader in the Controller uses this mapping table to quickly grab text or attribute values from incoming document’s token list, and reassigns them to corresponding text node or attribute value objects. Figure 8 illustrates using Structure Encoding based parser to parse the book record document shown in Figure 1 4.3 Structure Encoding Based Transformer Figure 9 shows the components of a Structure Encoding based transformer hosted in the XT XSLT processor. Of its four components, the tokenizer and the Structure Manager are the same as in the parser The two different components are the Pre-processor and the Transformation controller Pre-processor carries out the PreP phase of structure encoding based transformation using stylesheet and document structure to generate transformation Stencil Within the document structu re, the text and attribute nodes are changed to objects of a special type, which upon access, throws a special exception which uses an integer index to indicate which text node or attribute is accessed. The structure is then treated as a regular document and fed to XT along with the stylesheet. We have also extended XT, so that any expression that may catch the above-mentioned special exception is extended into a Future Expression, which can be evaluated by taking only t oken list as input. A Future Expression in turn throws itself as a special exception which is then either caught by another Future Expression or, eventually, by an action. An action generates a result segment, which can be one of the following  A string, in the case when there is no special exception caught  A Future Expression, when one or more special exceptions are caught, and  A Branch, when the action is an IfAction generated from an xsl:if or xsl:choose XSL element.The Stencil Resolver in the Transformation Controller is called in the AAP phase after the source document arrives and a transformation is requested.

5 EVALUATION Evaluation experiments described in this section are conducted on a TI OMAP 1511 Innovator device which runs in frequencies up to 200MHz. It has 32MB ROM as well as 32MB RAM. The OS used is a version of embedded Linux, and the JVM used is Intent from TAO Group The source documents and stylesheets used for evaluation are randomly selected from Sarvega’s XSLTBench and DataPower’s XSLTMark [17  after initially excluding some unrealistic transformations. We select these two benchmarks as they are influential indust ry benchmark and that they both support XSLT benchmarking. Note that some of the large source documents are less likely to have recurrent structures in real-world applications. We included them regardless as they might help us understand the implication of document size on system performance. Table 1 lists sizes of sample documents and the transformation stylesheets used for them. Table 2 lists the raw numbers used in following discussions Documents are fully read into memory before any measurement starts to minimize external disturbance Warm-up runs are always conducted prior to real measurement runs 5.1 Tokenization Figure 12 compares the speed of Swift mode and Hash mode against the speed of Nature mode tokenization The Swift mode is by far the fasted, having a median speedup of 2.40 over Nature mode. The median speed of Hash mode is about 81% of that of Nature mode which means a median hashing overhead of about 23.5%. In the worst case, this overhead is about 37.4 for wai  5.2 DOM-style Parsing Figure 13 and Figure 14 compare speed of Structure Encoding based parsing against that of kXML parsing for both Receiver ID Assigning and Sender ID Assigning. In Receiver ID Assigning, the underlying tokenizer always uses Hash mode, while in Sender ID Assigning, the tokenizer uses Swift mode when cache hit ratio is 100% \(i.e., structure of incoming document is always in cache\ode when cache hit ratio is 0 Figure 13 shows the results for the ideal case when cache hit ratio is 100%: the median relative speed is 4.34 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 1.35 when Receiver ID Assigning is used. The best case is in backwords and game which use the same source document\to 8 under Sender ID Assigning Figure 14 shows the results for the worst case when cache hit ratio is 0%: the median relative speed is 1.07 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 0.90 \(or an overhead of %11.1\ID Assigning is used. The worst sample is wai where the overhead is about 20.5% under Receiver ID Assigning. The reason Figure 12. Comparing Performance of Tokenization Modes Figure 14.

that Structure Encoding is a little faster than kXML even when cache hit ratio is 0 is likely because of the fact that, while we use kXML for tree building, we modified it slightly to interface it with our tokenizer which resulted in differences in execution traces and slight differences in runtime performance when execute in JVM Overall, these two figures demonstrate that Structure Encoding based parsing provides substantial speedup when structure recurrence is frequent, and incurs low overhead when such recurrence is rare 5.3 Transformation Similarly, Figure 15 and Figure 16 compare transformation speed of Structure Encoding based XSL processor against that of XT for both Sender ID Assigning and Receiver ID Assigning. Again, under Receiver ID Assigning, the underlying tokenizer always uses Hash mode, while under Sender ID Assigning, the tokenizer uses either Swift mode or Nature mode Figure 15 shows the results for the ideal case when cache hit ratio is 100%: the median relative speed of Structure Encoding based implem entation is 5.38 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 2.72 when Receiver ID Assigning is used. The best case is trend  where the relative speed is over 39 for Sender ID Assigning, and over 25 for Receiver ID assigning Figure 16 shows the results for the worst case when cache hit ratio is 0%: the median relative speed is 0.996 when Sender ID Assigning is used, and is 0.918 or an overhead of 8.9 is used. The worst sample is nitf-stylized where the overhead is about 14.6% under Receiver ID Assigning These two figures show that Structure Encoding based XSL processing offers even higher potential speedup than parsing, yet incurs lower overhead in worst cases This is understandable as, typi cally, a large portion of operations in transformation is for costly structurerelated operations, which we have pre-processed offline. Note that, as long as structure recurrence is frequent, the potential improvement is very high \(up to a median relative speed of 2.72\even if the receiver has to calculate structure ID through hashing 5.4 Compression We conducted an experiment to examine the effectiveness of Structure Encoding based compression. In the experiment, for each sample document, we randomly changed the values of 3 rd 8 th  13 th i.e., one in every 5, starting from the 3 rd  attribute and text node values. Thus our experiment Figure 16. Comparing Structu re Encoding Based Transformation and XT  Cache Hit Ratio 0  Figure 15.

assumes that around 20% of the attribute and text values are different from the template values Table 3 lists results from this experiment. The third column of the table shows the number of bytes transmitted for each sample document, while the 6 th column shows the time used to construct tokens from the compressed document. The table shows that, under above-described setup, the amount of data transmitted are reduced to 2.6% to 15.7% of the original size second column, listed in KB time is reduced to 5.4% to 11.3% of the Nature mode tokenization time, or 11.5% to 25% of the Swift mode tokenization time 5.5 Discussion Since in our implementations, we make changes to base systems \(KXML and XT changes are required to implement Structure Encoding performance differences demonstrated in this section are caused by differences in techniques rather than differences in implementations Our experiments clearly show that Structure Encoding can, potentially, greatly improve the efficiency of XML processing with relatively low penalty for worst cases. The worst case scenario happens when a receiver uses hash function to identify the structure of a document, only to find out that the document structure is not in cache. The penalty it pays for such worst case scenario, 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and 8.9% for transformation, can easily be compensated by future structure recurrence. Such cache-miss penalty is negligible when sender-assigning scheme is used Systems that are conscious of such client-side penalty can let the sender or anyone in the middle of the transmission path to assign ID without altering the semantics of the message or document Although we didn’t measure the impact of compression on parsing and transformation, it can be inferred from tables 2 and 3. For example, in the book case, with tokenization time reduced from 8.6ms Swift mode\s \(compressed\e will likely be further reduced from 8.8ms to around 1.3ms compared with 24.4ms for KDOM\Similarly transformation time may be further reduced from 11.5ms to around 4.0ms \(compared with 48.3ms for XT\Encoding based XML compression offers additi onal, significant performance improvements for XML parsing and transformation in mobile environments, where closelycoupled proxies commonly exists. With compression turned off, Structure Enc oding is fully compatible with Web specifications and can be used between any two Internet hosts, and it still offer very significant performance improvements when there is structure recurrence Without compression, for documents with recurrent structures, tokenization and structure hashing cost dominates the overall cost for parsing, and is the major part of the cost for transformation. Tokenization and structure hashing however are relatively simple operations that may be implemented in hardware with low cost. \(In fact, some mobile chipsets already have hardware implementation of hash functions such as MD5 for security purposes implementation can reduce tokenization and structure hashing cost to a fifth of the current cost, then there will be additional substantial improvement for the parsing and transformation of most of the documents used in our experiments In our system, a document havi ng a structure slightly different \(e.g., added a new element\from a previous structure will not be able to reuse the structure processing result of the previous structure. However our system pays off as long as this new, slightly different structure recurs in future documents 6 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we motivated exploiting structure recurrence to speedup XML processing in mobile environments, by reduci ng structure related transmission and processing costs. We presented the concept of Structure Encoding, and described approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures including one using collision-resistant hash function We explained in detail how to use structure encoding to speedup XML transmission, tokenization, treebuilding, and transformation. We described our implementation of st ructure encoding based tokenizer DOM parser \(based on kXML\processor \(based on XT\pression scheme. Our experiments conducted on a mobile test-bed demonstrated dramatic performance improvement in the presence of structure recurrence and low overhead otherwise. In ideal cases structure encoding offers speedups of up to 7 for parsing and over 38 for XSL transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change Structure encoding, however, is not applicable to all XML applications. Rather, it is more applicable to data-centric XML processing than to document-centric XML processing. A user randomly browsing Web pages is not likely to have high structure recurrence probabilities

Our current implementa tion does not support documents with “variable-le ngth arrays” – lists of identically structured elements with non-fixed lengths Otherwise identically structured documents with different array lengths are currently considered as having different structure We are currently working on supporting “variablelength arrays” to extend the applicability of Structure Encoding.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
