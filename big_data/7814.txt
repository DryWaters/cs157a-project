Roceedings of the 25 Annual btemational Conference of the IEEE EMBS Cancun Mexico September 17-21,2003 Mining and Interpretation of Association Rules among Protein Sequence Motifs Hye J Kam Doheon Lee and Kwang Hyung Lee Department of Biosystems, KAJST Daejeon Korea Abstract-In research of molecular biology it is essential to characterize proteins functionally One of such characterization method is to predict function from its amino acid sequence Motifs are representative 
features of functions in a protein However little is known about relations in more than two motifs In this paper we will find association rules on motifs using data mining algorithm Our result shows about 1,300,000 rules with lower bound of 95 confidence and 0.003 support The rules have enriched biological meanings As an example of pattern interpretation we examine two intracellular CaZt-release channels ryanodine receptor and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor Keywords-Association rules data mining sequence 
motif I INTRODUCTION To understand biological activities in cell it is essential to characterize functions of proteins From particular function of a protein there could be complex biological processes. One of the methods for characterizing proteins is to predict biological functions from basic building units  amino acids As the size of protein sequence database grows it becomes more powerful to predict functions by sequence comparison. Rather comparing whole protein sequences, we use protein sequence motifs that are representative feature of proteins and their functions Every protein can 
be characterized by either a distinct motif or a combination of motifs understanding motif association is crucial to understanding the nature and extent of biochemical functions I Various motif combinations are interesting because combining with other motifs a motif can give more complicated and specified function to a protein Nevertheless little is known about the relations in more than two motifs There are several motif finding algorithms and protein motif databases such as PROSITE 2 PRINTS 3 PFAM 4 using those algorithms In 
this paper, we use Interpro database that provides integrated and non redundant protein-to-motif data and find association rules on motifs using data mining algorithm. Biological meaning of the association rules is also present with an example This work was supported by Korea Research Foundation Grant KRF-2002-042-D00490 0-7803-7789-3/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE 11 METHODOLOGY We used Interpro database that provides integrated and non-redundant view of protein-to-motif data see Table I for extracting the associations among protein motifs using IBM Intelligent Miner for Data 6 The protein-to motif data 
was built from InterPro database with IDS to DB2 see Table E 1 An example of associalion rules amongprotein motif Here is an association rule simplified form of the real association rules of motif data ml AND m2 AND  mk  mk+l Symbol m means a protein motif, and the arrow shows a subordinate relation in math Therefore the symbolized association rule ml AND m2 AND  mk  mk+l has meaning if one or 
more motif\(s ml m2   mk are in a protein then motif mk+lwould exist in protein 2 Parameters in associalion rules Like other statistical results several values are shown with association rules for interpretation of the meaning The values are support I confidence 2 expected confidence 3 p-value 4 and lift S and their definitions are shown below TABLE 1 InterPro release 6.0 March 2003 Dambase Version Entries Swiss-Prot 41.0 122564 PRINTS 35.0 1750

There are several Ca2+ channels in a cell for biologically diverse functions Ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate IP receptors are intracellular 221-release channels Their major function is transferring Ca\224 ions through cellular membrane like other Ca2\221 channels However they are integral channel proteins with trans membrane helices and form homo-tetramer for their functions unlike other Ca2 channels The functional schemes of ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate IP receptors look same Both types of channels are structurally similar and regulated by positive feedback in which the released Ca2\222can bind back to the channels to increase the Ca*\222-release which tend to make the release occur in a sudden all-or-none fashion In many cells including muscle cells, both type of Ca2+-release channels are present 7 At the same time, the detailed mechanisms of them are quit different see Table IV They become activated upon binding of their respective ligands Ca and IP opening integral Ca2 channels Ryanodine receptor activation is a key component of muscular contraction Their activation allows release of Ca\224 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum \(SR And ryanodine receptors are involved in communication between transverse-tubules and the sarcoplamic reticulum of cardiac and skeletal muscle SI In contrast inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate IP receptors exist in most kind of cells that have endoplasmic reticulum ER and mediate diverse cellular responses according to their cellular context Consequently mutations in each channel cause different abnormalities in organism In Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases there are 25 ryanodine receptor proteins 24 of them have 8 InterPro motifs IPR002048 IPR005821 IPR003877 IPR001682 IPR000699 IPR003608 IPR0012 15 and IPR003032 And one of them  ryanodine receptor of sea urchin has 7 Interpro motifs all of the mentioned motifs without IPR001215 A association rule of those 8 motifs are shown in fig 2 with 0.0034 of support 100.00 of confidence 100.00 of p-value and 26804.67 of lift Motif lPR002048 represents 305 1 Ca2+-binding EF hand and IPROO5821 is common feature in 1160 ion transport proteins Of the mentioned protein sequence motifs TABLE N Comparison of ryadine and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receprorn Ryanodine receptor IP1 receptor Function Ca\223 release channel Complex Tetramer Location SR ER MW CCDb Similarity Structure 8 trans-membrane integral channels Ligand lyanodinei Ca\224 IP Difference Function mu~cle~ontraetion various epilepsy brain damage Mutationsl desease a malignant hypnthcrmia b central core disease  IPR003032 is specific feature of ryanodine receptors that sorts out 24 ryanodine receptors from other proteins In table ID you could see several association rules that have IPR003032 as 223tail\224 of 223head tail\224 rules With these rules we discover representative motifs for ryanodine receptor proteins and their function Because there are eight motifs for ryanodine receptors and two of them-IPR001215 and IPR003032 are the implying motifs for ryanodine receptors we make the shortest rules for ryanodine receptors that have IPR003032 as 223tail\224 The shortest rules have combinations of three motifs as 223head\223 elements and there can be non-redundant 20  combinations with the remaining six motifs We compare real resulting rules of 100.00 confidence with these candidates to find out active or the most important sites that make ryanodine receptors to function as ryanodine receptors \(see Table V VI As we mentioned ryanodine and inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptors are similar in function and structure Table VI shows several motifs that are shared in both receptors and are individually possessed by each receptor As you see if there are two or three motifs that exist not in IP receptors but in ryanodine receptors as 223head\224 they show rules for ryanodine receptor And almost every case has a motif that exists not in IP1 receptors but in ryanodine receptors as 223head\224 they also show rules for ryanodine receptors with confidence 100.00 However 16 rule is exception It has IPR002048 a motif exists not in IP receptors but in ryanodine receptors but it isn\222t shown for ryanodine receptors with 100.00 confidence Comparing with other rules which has only IPR002048 as a motif exists not in IP receptors but in ryanodine receptors in table V\(#S 6 13 and 14 with  16 rule there are different clustcrs according to different motif combinations A rule S of IPR002048 with IPR005821 and IPR000699 as 223head\224 exists with 100.00 confidence However a similar rule which has IPR001682 instead of IPR000699 does not exist with confidence 100.00 In fact I6 rule is also supported by seven variou     Fig 2 A graphical view of association rule in ryanadine receptor protein 3553

However the number of motifs is increasing day by day In this way as protein motif databases grows the number of association rules by our method will increase to provide better understanding for protein functions ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank IBM Shared University Research SUR program for providing computing facility used in this work REFERENCES I Minghua Dneg Shipra hlehta Fengzhu Sun and Ting Chen Inferring domain-domain interactions from protein-protein interactions Genomic research vol 12 no IO pp 1540-8, 2002 2 Laurent Flaquet el al The PROSITE database its status in 2002 Nucleic Acid Research vol 30 no I pp.235-8 2002 3 Atrwood el nl PRINTS and its automatic supplement prePRINTS Nucleic Acidr Research vol 31 no I 400-2, 2003 4 Bateman A el al The Pfam Protein Families Database Nucleic Acids Research vol 30 no I pp 276-280,2002 SI Mulder N.J el al The InterPro Database  2003 brings increased coverage and new features Nucleic Acids Research vol 3 I no I pp 315-8,2003 6 http:llwww-3.ibm.comisoft.rareidata/imi~~~lf~~d~t 7 Bruce Alberts Dennis Bray Julia Lewis Martin Raff Keith Roberts and James D Watson Molecular biologv of Ihe cell B'*~,Garlandpublishing 1994 ch IS pp 745-6 3554

may be interested in a particular rule, and to determine what interesting information or knowledge, not explicitly requested we could provide him, in addition to the proper answer Indeed. improving man-machine interaction by emulating a cooperative behavior has been proposed by some researchers through various techniques [23]. In [24], the author states requests .for datu can he clawified rotcgltlv into two kinds specific requests and gods. A .spec$c request e.stahli.rhes U rigid quul$cation, and is concerned only with data that mutchrs it precisely A goal, on the other hund, r9tahliske.s N furget yuufifkution and is concerned with datu which is close to the target". For Cuppens and Demolombe [25], "the basic idea is tiwt witen a person asks a question. he is not interested to know the answer+ju.st o increase his knowfedge, hit he hus the intention to realize some action. aizd the answer contains necesscity or z1s&amp; in&amp;wmcrtion to reulize riais action". In our context, when such additional knowledge is not supplied. this forces the user to retry a tedious rule exploration repeatedly until obtaining a satisfactory "matching In the prototype interface, c.f., Figure 3\(Up select items that can both appear in the preniise and/or the conclusion part. Once the minsup and minconf thresholds are fixed, the user can generate the desired rules. Both textual and graphical representation are provided. The user can fur ther filter specific rules from the generated ones. In the 3D histograms based visualization, c.f., Figure 3\(Down items are showed in red, whiie those of the conclusion are depicted in blue. The associated Confidence and support are represented by a scaled histogram For example, supposc that a user may bc interested in the rule RI. Then, when the user clicks on the label representing the R I  antecedent, the visualization interface provides in a displaying area all rules that are connected to RI. From the meta-rule MR1 depicted in Table IV, we can check that the following rules are connected to RI: R3 : e=+k \(conf.=l k+e \(conf.=O.X conf.=OA conf.=0.5 The aforementioned visualization prototype is currently un der implementation and we show in the following how its fea tures fulfill the Sclzneitlernzan's visual design guidelines [26 The author recommended the following tasks "Uven&amp;w ,firxt zoom und,fiLtec then detuils on demand". In fact, grasping a huge mount of rules can very often encourage user to pcrfomi a superficial exploration instead of a in-depth one. That's why, our visualization tool has to provide an overview of the derived association rules. which permits an overall knowledge direct access and interconnections within the knowledge space Once the user focused on a rule \(or a portion of rules smooth user-zooming capability should be performed. We try to implement to . f ish9v technique to perform such task, by keeping the context while zooming on the focused portion of knowledge. In addition to the complete description of the desired portion of rules \(i.e.. premise, conclusion and confidence the derivable rules that can be draw from such generic rule set We have also to mention the desired "reiute" task [26 highlighting useful relationships among knowledge. Therefore 231 FUZZ-IEEE 2004 Fig. 3 DOWN UP the system as described earlicr, thanks to its meta-rules base will display the set of connected rules V. CONCLUSION We presented in this paper an approach for providing a cooperative exploration of generic bases of association rules This additional knowiedge highlighting connected rules to a user-select rules permits an improvement of man-machine interaction. To do so. we constructed a set of fuzzy mcta-rules extracted from the discovered fuzzy closed itemsets

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
