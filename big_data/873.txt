program [2,3,4,5 ich fo cu ses o n  in tero p e rab l e m u ltiplatform aircraft health management data handling and analysis methods applicable to military aircraft and commercial air transportation. A primary goal of the programs is to significantly increase aircraft system availability, safety, maintainability, reliability, and affordability. The SAST program is also researching healthbased systems adaptation concepts, resulting in improved mission performance and operational capabilities. As such improved aircraft data accessib ility and interoperability is viewed as a key enabler Health management of Air Fo rce systems has until recently been the domain of semi-autonomous but dependent activities. CBM+ is an attempt to expand both the technology and the enterprise concept to encompass the 
vehicle, its maintenance, a nd the real-time sustainment environment. The heart of the process is data; its life blood is the ability to collect, store, analyze, and distribute the health-related products that sustain and improve the enterprise Using actual in-service aircraft and maintenance data, the SAST program has developed proof-of-concept demonstrations showing technical feasibility and potential payoffs for both military aircraft and commercial airlines Graphical user interfaces have been developed to access a common database for data visu alization, new diagnostic and prognostic algorithm research and development, and processing new datasets with the health management algorithms being developed. The resulting database schema data interface methods, and algorithms are applicable to new, derivative, and current aircraft and are in support of 
Air Force Expeditionary Logistics for the 21 st Century eLog21\paign plans and are in alignment with U.S Air Force Expeditionary Combat Support System \(ECSS and Global Combat Support Systems-Air Force \(GCSS-AF CBM+ related initiatives as well as AFRL Focused LongTerm Challenge #8 \(FLTC 8\e Mission Generation and Sustainment\224  The lessons learned from this program and prior health management system developmen ts are presented as a road map to focus on the process of system development and integration, see Figure 1. This paper also provides an overview of the concept and the coordination required to develop a working health management system   


  2  Figure 1 Health Management System Development Roadmap 2  C OORDINATION  Developing health management systems requires close upfront coordination of system requirements, development and validation processes, and schedules among multiple multidisciplinary organizations ranging from government organizations, original equipment manufacturers \(OEMs suppliers, and researchers, including those at universities colleges, small businesses, and research labs. As such, close coordination, good communications, clear statements of work split across multiple organi zations, mutually agreeable contract terms and conditions, collaborative working sessions and tools are essential Solid program leadership with deep subject matter experts of the various systems, s ubsystems, and interfaces along with strong technical and co mmunications skills are also necessary to develop effective health management systems Understanding the various us er functional requirements through the development of use cases and functional demonstrations with user evaluation sessions will ensure the system developed will meet the intended requirements Examples of health management system user classes include the following 1  logistics analysts 2  fleet planners for health-b ased systems and/or fleet operational adaptation 3  maintenance personnel \(organizational, intermediate and depot-level 4  engineering \(for fleet sustai nment as well as system enhancement research and development 5  original equipment manufacturers \(OEMs 6  system and subsystem suppliers 3  I NVENTORY  Data, data, data. While many engineers may seem to never be able to get enough of it program managers and others are often interested primarily in only high-level information summaries. As data is the essential \223blood\224 which flows through health management systems \226 enabling systems to be reconfigured or adapted, maintenance and missions to be planned, material requirements to be scheduled, and system or process improvements to be made \226 too little can result in analysis uncertainty, whereas too much can simply be overwhelming to the health management network and create 223analysis paralysis\224 for the intended user. It is important to ensure the system enables access to low-level detailed information, without inadve rtent filtering or data preprocessing which may corrupt the integrity of the data \(as may be needed for specific diagnostic or prognostic algorithms\igh-level information such as may be needed for management \223dashboard\224 system status displays. A high-level view of the typical flow of health management data, from raw data to actionable information is shown in Figure 2  Figure 2 High-Level View of Health Management Data Flow To begin developing the health management system architecture, developers must get an understanding of the currently available data and interfaces via a data inventory task. At the front-end data acquisition level, aircraft health management data is available, in general, from either onboard or offboard sources. O nboard sources consist of the following Aircraft Systems Data Sources Health Management Data Repository Health Management Data Consumers Actionable Information Up-Front Coordination Requirements Gathering Definition Data Inventory Architecture Trade Studies Interface Definition Future Initiatives Desired Functionality System Development Validation Verification Im p lementation System Improvements 


  3 1  operational data \(e.g. flight phase, status, or other discrete signals, etc 2  parameter data \(e.g. air speed angle of attack, timing etc 3  fault data \(e.g. fault and maintenance codes, etc Offboard data consists of the following 1  maintenance data \(e.g. maintenance actions, pilot or crew reports, part installation and removal information, etc 2  test stand data \(e.g. test stand test limit reference data test summary reports, etc 3  unstructured data \(e.g. bores cope or other hand-held inspection system data The data inventory task should document each of these available data sources, including providing example data sets as well as the data collection process flow and latency In addition to onboard and off board data, other reference data is essential for health management system development. Such reference data includes the following 1  system and subsystem organizational structure \(e.g work unit code or commercial aircraft Air Transport Association of Am ent 2  engineering units \(e.g. knots, psi, degrees F 3  onboard or offboard data recorder configuration, and 4  hardware and soft ware versions Algorithm tuning or other parameters, along with the corresponding release version of the algorithm or other metadata, are also essential data to retain for maintaining and managing change control of any resulting diagnostic or prognostic information which may have been derived from an analysis at a given point in time When developing functional requirements, trade studies will need to be performed as to whether a given health management function should be performed onboard or offboard. These allocations are often made for existing legacy systems based on trade studies weighing the following aspects 1  cost, weight, and power requirements 2  time-criticality of the \223monitoring, detection, and action\224 process 3  hardware data storage memory availability 4  onboard and offboard communication bandwidth wired or wireless\ailability 5  onboard and offboard computational resource / asset availability, and 6  software criticality 4  R EQUIREMENTS G ENERATION  To generate solid health management system requirements it is essential to have a detailed understanding of the baseline system architecture interfaces, users, and desired functionality. As such, effective program managers are essential to derive high-level requirements to meet the intended functional capabilities while ensuring alignment with future program strategies. As the high-level requirements are propagated down to lower-level, more specific requirements, it is essential for system / subsystem subject matter experts to be engaged to validate and verify new lower-tier requirements including 1\egacy system interfaces, data types, availability frequency, and access methods, and 2\stem input / output bandwidth capabilities. Design iterations, based on review of requirements, proposed designs, and cost benefit analysis such as during program working sessions and technical interchange meetings, allow the design team to mature and optimize the health management system. Throughout the requirements generation proce ss, requirements management tools should be used to improve quality and provide visibility and traceability of system requirements 5  A IR F ORCE S YSTEMS   E NTERPRISE  Future health management systems must include requirements to ensure they ar e in alignment with customer legacy and / or future systems and initiatives. For the USAF, this includes the Department of Defense \(DoD Information Technology Standards Registry \(DISR\, the Expeditionary Logistics for the 21 st Century \(eLog21 campaign and Condition Based Maintenance Plus \(CBM initiatives which are bei ng realized through such development efforts as the Global Combat Support System Data Services \(GCSS-DS  Heal t h  m a nagem e nt  systems, by their nature, should also improve system maintenance and operational efficiencies, which is complimentary to such lean programs as USAF AFSO-21 6  T OOL M ATURATION   D ATA A NALYSIS  There are many lessons which may be learned in developing a system which efficiently handles large volumes of data interfaces with legacy systems, and provides end users the intended functionality while allowing end users the capability and flexibility to discover new information and knowledge from the data 


  4 Prior research efforts have shown that by utilizing an open scalable, common data repository, onboard and offboard data from multiple aircraft types, maintenance system, and test stands may be stored in a commonly accessible environment, refer to Figure 3. In addition, by storing the data in a common universal format and providing improved access of the data to multidisciplinary users, common reporting and analysis tools may be developed to support analysis, allowing invaluable information to be quickly derived from the data For exam pl e, onboard and offboard data linking allows such tasks as identification of bad actor parts, enabling tracking, repair, and/or elimination from the supply chain. Also, correlation of onboard fault codes to certain environmental conditions or flight maneuvers may indicate the need for updated onboard fault detection logic. With properly developed tools, historical statistics and trends may be quickly identified, quantified and tracked over time, possibly providing valuable insight into such impacts of actual operation conditions on component mean time between failures, allowing operational, maintenance, and/or component improvements to be made. Anomalous \223could not duplicate\224 events may also be quickly analyzed to determine the root cause  Figure 3 Interoperable Common Database and Analysis Tools Common diagnostic and prognostic algorithms and data analysis tools may be developed and re-used across different aircraft types to help solve common classes of problems. The use of a system with an open database access layer also minimizes software development efforts to easily expand and incorporate new data sources and system users 7  Q UALITY C ONTROL  There are many lessons learned regarding quality control This includes establishing good software development practices, including the up-front process of requirements generation, to software de velopment, and finally to validation and verification testing. This applies to all levels of health management software including translator database, data query and interface software Software and data \223health\224 must also be included as part of the complete health management system scheme. For instance, data load quality s hould be monitored to ensure data integrity. During data load, look for trends in decreased data quality, such as through the use of data load report logs which may be used to document the number of errors during loading. This may help to determine root cause of any potential data source, translator software, network, security or hardware issues Health management system developers should also consider adding the \223number of invalid timestamps\224 as metadata during data load, such as in a log file. This may then be trended, over time, to monitor the \223health\224 of the actual data. Timestamp reset quality check monitoring may then be incorporated as part of the data load process Data quality assurance require ments should be split between the translator and the data analysis tools as shown in Figure 4. That is the translator quality assurance functionality should include \223data quality / da ta integrity\224 checking, e.g verify all of the expected data fields are present and the data format / structure is as expected. Whereas the posttranslated, data analysis t ool functionality should include 223parameter quality\224 checks, e.g. verify if a particular sensor is known to be bad, thus corrupting some or all of the data for the particular sensed parame ter, as well as the impact of corrupted inputs to other de pendent systems. This will minimize the data preprocessing that is done up-front during database loading, which may inadvertently otherwise filter or corrupt the data for downstream processes To elaborate on this, getting as close to the \223raw\224 data source as possible will also ensure any intermediate translation errors or inherent pre-processing from propagating through the data stream. Lastly, original, raw data files should not be deleted. While additional storage space will be required, the original raw data should be archived as it may be invaluable for future system development and refinements  Figure 4 Separation and Allocation of Health Management Systems\222 Quality Assurance Functional Requirements Common Interoperable Health Mgt Database Bayesian Network Signal Processing Mining Trending Rule base IF x1 THEN y1 IF x2 THEN y2 IF x3 THEN y3 225 225 225 225 225 225 225 225 225 225 225 225 002 Diagnostic Reasoner 002 Prognostic Reasoner 002 Fusion 002 Diagnostic Reasoner 002 Prognostic Reasoner 002 Fusion Neural Networks Aircraft Data Sources New Data Translators Reasoner Development Integration Raw Data Translator Storage Data Consumer Applications Processes Data quality and integrity checking Parameter quality checking Actionable Information
