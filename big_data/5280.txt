 Abstract  A Smart Grid is an enhanced version of electric grid in which the demand and supply are balanced to meet the customers need. The paper deals with the formation of a cloud-based Smart Grid for analyzing the Bid-Data and taking decisions to balance the demand of customer needs. The proposed formation of smart grid will deal with Big Data set which will contain the data regarding the power usage patterns of customers, historic weather data of the location, the current demand and supply details. The grid will operate on the data being fetched from the cloud storage. The paper also focuses on smart grid being framed with the renewable energy sources  Keywords 226 Smart Grid, Renewable Energy, Cloud Computing, Hadoop, Big Data Analytics, Cassandra, Hive   I.  INTRODUCTION   The Smart Grid is formed as a combination of altering currents in which the production of electricity from the renewable energy sources are considered and analyzed whether if the supply will meet the demand and alternate decision to be taken by the Smart Grid in meeting the demand. The need for generation of electricity is growing worldwide and it has greater impact towards the industrial development of a country h e  growths in databases are also tremendously increasing as the historic data are helpful in the future analysis and can be taken as a factor for decision making. The historic weather data are stored in the cloud using the service 223Cassandra\224 database and Hadoop File System is used to retrieve the needed data during the time of estimation of the need by the Smart Grid The query language used to query the Cassandra database is the Hive Query Language also known as HiveQL. The paper aims in giving a proposal to form a cloud-based Smart Grid which will act as an intelligent system to maintain the balance between the demand and the supply  II. SMART GRID   The Smart Grid is formed by integrating the use of information technology, automation, telecommunications and electric network control. The electric network control in turn involves the sensors, smart meters and deployment of control strategies and real-time data processing h e  Smart Grid involves all the operations of a system such as generation, transmission and distribution. The Smart Grid combines all the power generation resources such as solar energy, Wind Energy, Nuclear power, Wind power Thermal Power etc  Figure 1 represents the basic structure of a Smart Grid                  Figure 1: Basic Structure of a Smart Grid   A Smart Grid takes its source of generation from various power generation resources like both renewable and non-renewable. The renewable resource includes solar energy, wind energy, hydraulic power etc where as the non-renewable energy resources include conventional power systems such as nuclear power, fossil fuel etc. The usage and implementation of Smart grids is high that most of the countries shows interest in the inclusion of smart grids in their infrastructure. A Smart Grid in turn consists of Micro Grids which will be separate modules to produce energy from renewable energy sources and non-renewable energy sources  An example to be considered here is the \223Puducherry Smart Grid Pilot Project\224. The project is implemented by the Government of Puducherry, India and Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. The project is being implemented with the objectives h a v i ng a co m m o n  sharable platform, help the consumers reduce their electricity bills, user friendly interface and balance the demand/supply chain The Smart Grid is a major thrust area in which several ongoing researches are done. Many countries have started implementing the Smart Grid to add to their existing power grid to increase the production of electricity Especially the European countries and United States have large number of projects implemented using smart grids A cloud-based architecture for Big-Data Analytics in Smart Grid: A Proposal   M.Mayilvaganan 1 M.Sabitha 2 1, 2 Department of Computer Science, P.S.G College of Arts and Science, Coimbatore, India mayilvaganan.psg@gmail.com,sabithamuthusamy.psg@gmail.com    Smart Grid Solar Energy Thermal Power Wind Power Nuclear Power Industry Use Domestic Use 978-1-4799-1597-2/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 


 III. BIG DATA ANALYTICS   The Big Data Analytics is a field which deals with data which are high in volume, velocity and variety When the data to be analyzed is high in volume \(i.e in Petabyte, Exabyte or Brontobyte\e velocity is high and the variety is also present then the usage of Big Data analytics becomes mandatory. Big Data Analytics comprises of distributed file systems framework such as Hadoop, Mahout, a multi- user database to handle huge amount of data such as Cassandra, MongoDB, HBase and a query language namely HiveQL. These software are open source in nature from Apache Foundation  The big data analytics can be used in our smart grids to store the temperature history of a place, user demands production data etc. The data can be stored in cloud environment and processing can be done  A.  Hadoop  The Apache Hadoop is a framework which helps in distributed processing of large data sets. Hadoop can be scaled up from one server to thousands of machines with local computation. The Apache Hadoop Library is designed in such a way to handle failures and provide reliable service to the customers. Hadoop uses the concept of MapReduce. The MapReduce framework consists of single master and one slave node per cluster       Block ops  Read   Data Nodes Replication  Data Nodes     Rack 1   Write    Rack 2       Figure 2: Hadoop Distributed File System Architecture    The Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS follows master/slave architecture. A HDFS cluster consists of a Name Node and a master server that supervises the file system namespace. A Data node is present to manage the storage in the cluster. In HDFS a file is split into one or more blocks. These blocks are in turn stored in the Data Nodes. The Name Node handles the namespace operations such as opening, closing and renaming directories. The Name Node also takes care of the mapping of blocks to the Data Nodes. The above architecture gives an idea about the working of the Hadoop Distributed Files System  B.  Cassandra  Cassandra is an open source distribution DBMS which was designed The Cassandra database is used to store large data sets. The Cassandra also support cloud infrastructure making it to suit for our smart grid implementation. Cassandra is in use at Netflix, eBay Twitter, Reddit etc. Cassandra has a proven history of reliability as it does not have a single point of failure. As the CAP Theorem also known as Brewer\222s Theorem states no distributed computing system can have all of three values Consistency, Availability and Partitioning Tolerance [5  Cassa n d ra tak e s th e t w o  v a lu e s  Av ailab ili t y  and Partitioning Tolerance. The Cassandra database can be used in our smart grid to store the temperature data user demand and supply  C.  Hive   Apache Hive data warehouse software is used to query large datasets which are stored in distributed environment. Hive uses a simple SQL-like query language called QL to query the databases. MapReduce concept can also be implemented with Hive. Hive consists of two components namely Hcatalog and WebHcat Hcatalog is a table which allows the users to easily write data on the grid. WebHcat provides a service to run Hadoop MapReduce, Pig, and Hive using a HTTP interf   IV. FORMATION OF A SMART GRID    The traditional electric grid can be replaced with a smart grid. A smart grid consist of sensors, actuators smart meters, distributed management system, decision support system et h e s m art g ri d f o r m at i o n i s don e by identifying the different resources of power generation such as solar energy, wind energy, fossil fuel etc           Transmitter       Figure 3: A Smart Grid N ame Node Metadata Client Blocks Client Smart Grid Domestic Use Industry Solar Panels Wind Turbines Nuclear Power 2013 IEEE Internat\ional Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research 


  The traditional electric grid can be transformed by placing a smart grid which is bidirectional that it balances the load between the consumer and the producer. Smart Grid is of high usage when it comes to the efficient usage of power. Smart meters are fixed in the smart grid to monitor the consumer requirements and measure the resource produced. The load balancing is done by the smart grid by transferring the load from low demand grid to high demand grid. The production and storage of power is monitored by the smart grid to enable/disable the production depending upon the demand  The user can also calculate the usage requirements and switch between the peak hours to regular hours for power requirements. The smart homes are helpful for the consumers to keep track of their monthly usage and cut down their monthly electric bills  V. A CLOUD-BASED ARCHITECTURE   The smart grid consists of components such as smart meters, sensors, decision support systems etc to achieve the goal of making the conventional electric grid to behave \223smart\224. The cloud based architecture discussed in the paper will contain the inclusion of big data analytics to analyze the historic data, the consumer usage history and predict the production of power from various resources A cloud computing has various different definitions [8   the one such definition is [9   223Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction\224  The cloud computing environment provides various services models such as Infrastructure as a Service \(IaaS Network as a Service \(NaaS\latform as a Service PaaS\d Software as a Service \(SaaS\here are different kinds of cloud deployments such as private cloud, public cloud, community cloud, hybrid cloud distributed cloud et A cl ou d bas e d arch i t ect u re can  be used with the big data analytics in the smart grid to efficiently balance the load in power production and supply. The advantages of the three technologies viz smart grid, big data analytics and cloud computing are pooled together to produce an improved version of smart grid to perform the following functionalities  200  Analyze the historic weather data and predict the energy production 200  Analyze the consumer behavior \(power usage patterns to predict the demand in advance 200  Keep track of the energy production from various sources and take decision of switching between the high/low priority demands 200  Balance the load with the demand/supply chain 200  The storage/transfer of the generated power to be done efficiently   A cloud-based smart grid [11 1 2  w ill u s e th e m i cro  grids to compute the task of storing the historic weather data and its architecture will contain a node storing the weather data and the smart meters working on the demand-response system to access the data to take decision                 SMART GRID HDFS       Cloud Environment          Nodes  Rack 2    Rack 1     Cassandra DB   Figure 4: An improved smart grid architecture   The above proposed architecture consists of a smart grid in which the other mandatory electronic components are available and apart from it the HDFS is included.

 distributing the storage to nodes in racks. The processing is done using the Map/Reduce concept. The smart grid in the proposed architecture uses a prediction algorithm to predict the demand and supply. The system uses a distributed environment in which the energy resources renewable and non-renewable\stributed; the consumers such as home, industries are also in a distributed environment. The proposed architecture of implementing big data analytics will be suitable for the smart grid environment    VI. CONCLUSION   In this paper, we have dealt with the efficient planning of power production and distribution. The implementation and usage of smart grids have increased now days. The paper has suggested architecture to implement big data analytics and cloud architecture in the smart grids to make them even better. The proposed architecture is a proposal and the implementation of the smart grid is in process   FUTURE WORK   The future work deals with the implementation of the architecture with few connected smart grids and storing the weather data in cloud based databases and using the big data analytics to calculate the user demand and supply    REFERENCES  1 Mayilvahanan, M., and M.

S YSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION  To evaluate the effectiveness of the CITSS architecture proposed in section III, a pilot system was developed and a distributed apparel manufacturing company with multiple plants was selected as the pilot company to evaluate this system. The  pilot manufacturing company has 4 production plants located in 4 different cities, which receives production orders from its global customers and produces these order in its 4 plants according to customers requirements.  These plants include 5 types of production departments, including cutting silk-screen, sewing, finishing and packaging. Each production department includes one or more shop floors. Each sewing shop floor consists of multiple assembly lines while other shop floor consists of multiple workstations. In each plant, different production departments are included The pilot system contains the functions of remote production tracking and production scheduling at company level. In the pilot manufacturing company,  one shop floor in each production department of each plant was selected out to implement and test the pilot system In apparel manufacturing, sewing production has the largest effects on production performance of each plant. An RFID terminal is thus installed in each sewing workstation in sewing assembly lines to capture the production records of each sewing operations. In cutting department, RFID terminals are installed in each cutting workstation to capture the output of cutting pieces from each cutting bed. In silk-screen department each bundle of garments is collected while the production record of each piece of garment is collected in finishing department. In packing department, RFID terminals collect the records of each carton of garments. In addition, three RFID terminals are installed in a fabric suppliers shop floors to track the production progress of main fabric materials The pilot system was developed on the basis of Java/J2EE SQL Server 2005 and web technologies. The production management at different levels can track the production progress of each order by some summarized reports, and also assign each order to an appropriate plant. Some examples of interfaces of the pilot system are shown in Fig.s 6-8 Fig. 6 shows an interface illustrating the comparison of production efficiency and progress for different operations in a production unit. By this interface, one can compare the average efficiency and progress of different operations of a production order being processed in a plant, a production department, a shop floor or an assembly line. It can be clearly found if the production flow of an order is smooth in a production unit. One can also compare the actual operating time of each operation with its SAM value by this interface. For example, the average operating time of operation 001 and its SAM value is 20 and 22 seconds respectively. This interface can be used by production management at different levels to track each orders production detail   Fig. 6. Interface 1  Production detail of operations in an order  Fig. 7. Interface 2  Production detail of orders in an order group   Fig. 7 shows an interface illustrating the comparison of production progress of all orders in an order group, which is designed for production management at plant and company levels to track each order and each order groups production progress. As shown in this figure, the order group NKESP01B1 consists of 21 orders. On the whole, 55% total workload of this order group has been completed. 89 workload of order 2 has been completed while only 18 workload of order 9 was completed. By this interface, one can compare the production progress and average operating time for each product of different orders in an order group Fig. 8 shows the interface of showing the solution of assigning production orders to different plants, which is the result of production scheduling at company level. As shown in this figure, the orders of order group NIT-WI12-2B are assigned to plant 2 while the orders of order group OKYSP13-1S are assigned to plant 1 for processing. Each production order can only be assigned to one plant for

B Evaluation 
The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is evaluated by examining the benefits brought by the pilot system. Before the pilot system was developed and implemented in the pilot manufacturing company, production data were collected by manual recordings and the production management could not track the production progress of each order in a real-time and accurate manner. The production schedulers at the headquarters made production scheduling decisions by assigning each order to an appropriate plant based on their experience and subjective judgments, which generated lowly efficient solutions After the pilot system was run in the pilot company for more than 6 months, the system performance was analyzed and evaluated by comparing the production performance of latest 3 months and the performance of the same 3 months of last year before the system was implemented. On the basis of the comparison in the two selected periods, the pilot company reported that the following tangible benefits have been achieved 1\ 8% reduction in labor and system costs: No computer operator is required to input job tickets records now. The pilot system needs less computer servers, less installation and maintenance costs, less IT-related and IE-related manpower 2\5% increase in production efficiency: The real-time and accurate production data collected and effective production scheduling decisions generated by the pilot system can definitely improve production efficiencies 3\ 12% reduction in production waste: Effective order tracking and monitoring leads to more transparent production process, which has direct effects on reducing overproduction defects, and in-process inventories. Effective order scheduling decreases the possibility of rush production, which is also helpful to reduce defects V C ONCLUSIONS  A production tracking and scheduling system was developed to make effective production tracking and scheduling in a distributed labor-intensive manufacturing environment based on a cloud-based system architecture and 3 different management levels. Due to its cloud-based and easily accessible feature, except for the subordinate plants, real-time production data can also be collected conveniently from supplying and outsourcing plants. These data collected are transferred to remote real-time production database via TCP/IP protocol, and are then analyzed and extracted to be used in production scheduling decision-makings. The intelligent technique-based scheduling mechanism is able to handle production scheduling tasks in distributed labor-intensive manufacturing environments from a holistic perspective The effectiveness of the CITSS was validated by the application of a pilot system in a distributed apparel manufacturing company with multiple plants. By implementing this system, better supply chain coordination and better production scheduling decisions can be achieved so as to provide its customers with better services A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors acknowledge the financial  supports from the Sichuan University \(Grant No. SKYB201301\ and the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No 000\021 71302134 R EFERENCES  1 K  B u t n er, "Th e s m a r t e r sup p ly ch ai n of t h e f u tu re

shown in Figure 11 The X-axis is the percentage of the normal completion time of Query 5 when a failure is injected Firstly it is not surprised that ParaLite is about twice faster than Hive One reason for the superiority is that not all the operators are checkpointed in ParaLite Moreover Hive uses sort-join while ParaLite uses hash-join In addition the start-up overhead for Hadoop cannot be ignored Hive uses 3 MapReduce jobs to express the query and each takes 10 15 seconds before all map tasks are started Secondly the slowdown for both system are similar However the slowdonw of Hadoop is limited to the interval of heartbeat message send to the JobTracker\(master from each TaskTracker\(worker After a x time we set it 30 seconds from receiving the last heartbeat if the master does not receive a new heartbeat message it sets the status of the worker failed and re-schedules the failed tasks So for a light-weight job whose execution time is not much larger than the interval the slowdown becomes larger because it needs to wait for the task re-execution On the other hand ParaLite detects the failure immediately after a process fails and then starts the recovery D Scalability To evaluate the scalability of ParaLite we perform TPCH Query 3 on 10 20 and 30 nodes with the s cale factor 100 200 and 300 respectively As Figure 12 shows ParaLite scales well with the increase of nodes The selective checkpointing mechanism adapts to clusters with different number of nodes                   0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 10 20 30 Execution Time\(s of nodes Fig 12 The scalability of TPC-H Query 2 VI C ONCLUSION To efciently support intra-query fault tolerance for longrunning queries we propose a selective checkpointing mechanism which automatically chooses necessary operators whose output data are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the query in a failure-prone environment The mechanism provides a cost model to simulate the execution of the query plan and takes a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem The mechanism is implemented in a share-nothing parallel database ParaLite and evaluated with several TPC-H queries The experimental results rstly show that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Our selective checkpointing can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other fault-tolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than brute-force approach while keeping a similar effectiveness R EFERENCES  D DeW itt and J Gray   P arallel Database Systems the Future of Highperformance Database Systems Commun  vol 35 no 6 pp 8598 1992  J Dean and S Ghema w at MapReduce

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earths rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
