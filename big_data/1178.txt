delaying the launch ready date \(the Delta \nII was selected by NASA for SMAP at CDR-time and observatory packaging and volume standpoint, \nFigure 11. Radiometer band divided into 16 x 1.5 MHz spectral \nsub-bands for RFI detection. \nFigure 12. Complementary cumulative distribution functions \nof real and simulated Aquarius radar noise-only data for sets \nof passes over different geographical regions. Power levels \nabove the radar noise floor are due to RFI. \n  10\na key challenge was packaging the RBA within the most \nconstraining vehicle: Minotaur IV+ with the 92-inch fairing \n\(Figure 13 compatibility was \nalso a challenge given the sensitivity of the instruments \(and \nespecially the radiometer to L-band emissions. The RBA and \nSIA also posed a challenge to the spacecrafts pointing \ncontrol design This also posed a challenge for the fault \nprotection design, primarily to ensure that minor faults do not nresult in a spin down of the observatory with the additional \nloss of science observation time that would impose.  \nThe spacecraft is three axisstabilized and employs \nmomentum compensation via reaction wheels to naccommodate the angular momentum of the spinning \ninstrument. The spacecraft has an aluminum primary structure \nwith a zenith deck provided for mounting the SIA and an anti-\nsun facing panel for mounting the radar electronics. A \nmodular design for accommodating subsystems, each on a \npanel, provides for ease of integration \(Figure 14 source and provides about 1400 W for the \nobservatory. Spacecraft batteries have a total 74 Ah capacity \nusing Li-ion small cell chemistry based on NASA Aquarius/ \nArgentinas/CONAE Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas-D n\(Satellite for Scientific Applications or SAC-D heritage blow-\ndown monopropellant hydrazine \(N2H4 MR-111C \nthrusters and a single ROCSAT-heritage titanium diaphragm \nfuel tank. \nSMAP spacecraft avionics and power electronics leverage a \nJPL planetary heritage design based on the commercial \nRAD750 flight computer and Peripheral Component \nInterconnect \(PCI C&DH telecommunication and instrument \ninterfaces, power bus architecture \(including power \nconverters, switches and pyro-firing circuits the Reaction Control System \(thrusters and \nlatch valves including a 128 GB NVM capable of \naccommodating much larger science data storage volumes \nand transmission rates \(130 Mb/s downlink rate vs. 6 Mb/s \ntypical for planetary missions maximum X-band downlink \nrate engineering interface control, a high-capacity \nsolar array interface, and a new power bus controller.  \nThe ACS employs high-heritage, flight-proven attitude \nsensors and control mechanisms. Attitude knowledge is nprovided by a star tracker and 12 sun sensors, which also \n \nFigure 13. The Minotaur IV 92-inch fairing posed the largest \nconstraint on the observatory packaging design.  \n \nFigure 14. SMAP employs a modular packaging approach. \n  11\nsupport safing and attitude reinitialization. Redundant \ninertial measurement units propagate attitude knowledge \nbetween stellar attitude updates. Three large reaction \nwheels, with a 4th wheel used for momentum compensation, \nmaintain momentum balance between the spacecraft and the \nSIA and counteract any disturbance torques. Three magnetic \ntorque assemblies are used to manage the reaction wheel \nmomentum and are controlled based on on-orbit magnetic \nfield information from a single 3-axis magnetometer. Orbit \nposition is determined via two-way Doppler tracking and \npropagated on-board the spacecraft. \nThe telecom subsystem is composed of redundant S-band \ntransponders for uplink/downlink command and telemetry \nfunctions to the NASA Earth Network and Space Network \n\(single access mode to support orbit determination. The high \nrate X-band data downlink is provided by redundant X-band ntransmitters. As stated earlier, science data volume was \nsufficiently constrained to enable science requirements to be \nmet without requiring a TDRSS data return capability. The \ntelecommunication antennas are mounted on a fixed \(non-\ndeployable geometry and configuration was \nconstrained to avoid intrusion into the instrument antenna \nRF FOV from the zenith direction and to avoid intrusion \ninto the nadir-mounted telecom antenna FOV. Several solar \narray configurations evolved before final design selection \n\(see evolving configurations in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 15 within the above FOV constraints potential power \nconstraints elsewhere in the designthis in turn drove a five-\npanel configuration with four separate deployments \(Figure \n15a three-panel configuration \(with only two \ndeployments FOV \(Figure 15b in ground science data processing; however, high-\nfidelity RF analysis \(confirmed by scale model testing nshowed that perturbations are very minor and may be \nnegligible. The stowed configuration was also 


significantly \ndriven by launch vehicle fairing packaging and resulted in \nhaving no exposed cells when stowed. This iterative design \nexample is representative of the close interaction between \nscience instrument, and spacecraft design teams to arrive at \nthe least complex design to satisfy mission requirements. \nSMAP uses a single-string architecture with selective \nredundancy. Graceful degradation features have also been \ndesigned into the observatory where practical. The \ntransponders, transmitters, and inertial reference units \(IRUs redundancy and all the thrusters are placed on a single \nbranch. The reactions wheels are oriented and sized so that a \nfailure in an individual wheel can be tolerated. Each magnetic \ntorque assembly is internally redundant \(via redundant \nwindings in the case of a magnetometer failure. \nSurvival heaters and many instrument slip rings are \nredundantly wired. All actuators include redundant windings. \nParticular attention has been paid to fault protection design to \nreduce the likelihood and mission impact of specific faults \nand also to minimize the number of fault events that cause the \ninstrument to despin. The observatory is designed to robustly \nand autonomously recover attitude following the momentum \nchange associated with a despin, but the return to science noperations is a longer process resulting in undesirable science \ndata loss. For this reason, the instrument remains spinning for \nall but the most severe faults \(Figure 16 Table 5. \nFigure 15a. Early solar array configuration was constrained by \nboth instrument and telecom antenna FOVs. \nFigure 15b. Final solar array simplified to reduce panels and \ndeployments; allowed slight penetration into instrument \nantenna FOVs. \n  12\n7. ADAPTING PLANETARY AVIONICS \nSMAPs avionics design is derived from the Mars Science \nLaboratory \(MSL selectively apply elements \nof MSLs design to avoid unnecessary complexity for \nSMAPs application while also minimizing the amount of \nnew design and development required. In the end, SMAP was \nable to substantially reduce the hardware complement relative \nto the MSL design and also limit the number of new board \ndesigns required. Another challenge was to adapt MSLs fully \nredundant design to a single string application.  \nTo minimize new avionics development, the most significant \ncapability changes were addressed by the development of the \nNVM card. Specific challenges that this card addressed were \n\(1 read/write capability to \nsupport simultaneous science acquisition \(6 Mbps for \nradiometer and 40 Mbps for radar 130 Mb/s 2 data storage \(128 GB 3 BER 10-9 ndata loss. The NVM leveraged a similar architectural design \ndeveloped for the MSL MastCAM instrument however, the \nMSL NVM only had 4 GB storage and a 6 Mbps transport \nrate. Using the NVM avoided adding a separate solid state \nrecorder within the bus, which would have proved difficult to \npackage given the volume constraints. The new NVM card is \nshown in Figure 17. \nA new 128 GB flash memory chip was selected for the NVM, \nwith a layout compatible with the older chip used in MSL's \nNVM card design. A large lot of these new parts was \nprocured early in Formulation and subjected to extensive \nenvironmental, radiation, and life qualification testing. Test \nresults showed that the actual BER performance was orders of \nmagnitude better than required for the SMAP application \n[17]. This, in turn, enabled SMAP to implement the NVM \nwith a relatively simple error detection and correction \napproach rather than a more complex approach recommended \nby the manufacturer for other applications. Beyond the \nmission-specific results for SMAP, the work conducted to nqualify these parts contributed to the recently published Flash \nQualification Guideline for Space Application [18]. Early \ntesting on an MSL EM MASTCam NVM card showed the \ndata throughput capability to be 130 Mb/s. SMAP set this as a \nconstraint on the maximum downlink science data rate to \navoid further significant design effort associated with this \ncard. Further design refinements during development yielded nimprovements in data throughput; the engineering model \nNVM demonstrated a 280 Mb/s throughput capability nproviding significant margin over SMAPs requirement.  \n8. EMI/EMC \nGreat attention was given in the design of the observatory \nfor EMC with all the expected electromagnetic \nenvironments including the self-generated environments. \nObservatory radiated emissions could adversely affect \nradiometer science performance therefore, the most severe \nEMC requirement limits \(notches Figure 18 and launch vehicle systems.  \nDuring Formulation, SMAP established an EMC Design \nControl Plan [19] to provide design guidance to ensure \nrequirements compliance. New designs incorporated best \npractices to reduce the likelihood of generating L-band \nemissions. In electronics, clock transitions were slowed and \ngrounding paths were made as short as practical. Energy \ngenerated that could become radiated is contained within a \ncomplete Faraday cage created by sealed electronics boxes \nTable 5. Observatory mass and power breakdown \(reflects \nCDR

New NVM card for SMAP n  13\nand shielded cabling. The spacecraft structure could not be \nan adequate Faraday cage due to the large number of \npenetrations required. \nElectronics boxes were fabricated without joints where \npossible close-outs were sealed with EMI gaskets or EMI \ntape. Assemblies that were constrained to use high-density nD-connectors that leak emissions at L-band were treated \nwith conductive overwrap to provide a complete covering. \nPedestals for connectors on the C&DH assembly were \nadded to aid overwrap application, and a cover plate was \nadded to seal the gaps between faceplates of the individual \ncards in the box \(Figure 19 added other provisions to address EMC including a \ncabling design that assures a continuous Faraday cage nbetween electronics boxes using twisted wire pairs with a \nshielded jacket \(TPSJ TPSJ \nwith Laird tape provides better shielding at L-band than \nTPSJ with copper braid overwrap. Because radiated \nemissions can be directional and connectors are often a \nsource, the ICE was configured so that the connectors \npointed away from the reflector to further attenuate \nemissions that could reflect interfere with science \ninstruments. The BAPTA was identified by modeling to be a \nlikely source of leakage; therefore, the observatory structure \nabove the BAPTA was designed as a Faraday cage and the \nrotation pathway for emissions was directed into the \nspacecraft interior where any emissions would less likely \ninterfere with science measurements. \nExisting inherited designs \(most of the commercial space \nassemblies used on SMAP accepted without \nadditional modifications for EMC. EMC requirements were \nlevied on these assemblies but with the recognition some \nmay be found non-compliant. In these cases, SMAP will use \ntraditional EMI/EMC control techniques during integration \nand test in order to control emissions \(adding EMI tape or \ncloth to cover possible areas of leakage performs the \nkey on-orbit operations needed to implement the conical \nscanning scheme employed for data acquisition by the radar \nand radiometer. The observatory uses a zero momentum bias, \ndual-spin architecture to rotate its large antenna at a spin rate \nof 1314.5 rpm, while the spacecraft bus provides a three-axis ncontrolled platform that maintains both itself and the \ninstrument sections spin axis in a nadir-pointed orientation. \nThe major pointing and control functional aspects and design \ncharacteristics are illustrated in Figure 20. A key challenge \nFigure 18. EMC requirement in the radiometer band for \nassemblies outside the spacecraft structure. Inside the \nstructure, the lower limit is relaxed by 6 dB. \n \nFigure 20. SMAP pointing and control system functional aspects and design characteristics. \nFigure 19.

In \na recent operational example of a nadir-pointing observatory \nemploying a momentum-compensated rotating antenna, \nWindSat/Coriolis, a dedicated momentum wheel was also \nused to counteract the antennas angular momentum, in a \nmanner similar to that planned for NROSS [21]. SMAPs napproach provides a degree of functional redundancy for \nwheel failure and reduces control complexity nFigure 22 shows the system architecture, encompassing the \nattitude and spin rate determination functions attitude \ncontrol modes for both RWA and Reaction Control System \n\(RCS momentum \ncompensation, and the torque rod-based scheme employed \nfor RWA momentum management.

resonance effects. Frequency \ndistribution of these system components is shown in Figure \n23 to illustrate this aspect of the design. The minimum 1st \nflexible mode frequencies of the solar array, as well as the nantenna and boom, became key design requirements on the \nstructure to ensure adequate separation from the spin control \nsystem and the observatorys attitude control bandwidth. \n \nFigure 22. Pointing and control system architecture. \n \nFigure 21. Observatory sensor and actuator description.\n  15\n10. LAUNCH VEHICLE CHALLENGES \nThe launch vehicle selection process for SMAP involved \nboth programmatic and technical challenges to develop an \nobservatory design that was compatible with several \npotential medium- and large-class launch vehicles and to \naccommodate a launch vehicle selection late in the design \nlifecycle without stretching the development schedule or \ndelaying the launch ready date. SMAPs strategy effectively \nisolated the observatory design from launch vehicle \nuncertainty by applying very conservative bounding design \nloads and environments designing to the most constraining \nfairing volume, and by developing a flexible launch vehicle \nadapter design to address vehicle-specific interface and \nmission design differences after launch vehicle selection nWhen SMAP began Formulation in September 2008, there \nwas a dearth of suitable, affordable medium-class launch \nvehicles commercially available [23]. SMAP was too \nmassive to be lofted on a Taurus XL. Delta II production \nhad been halted. The Falcon 9 had not yet flown. Evolved \nexpendable-class launch vehicles \(EELVs were costly and \ngrossly over-capable for SMAP, and SMAPs tall stowed \nconfiguration effectively eliminated it as a co-manifest \noption on an EELV. The situation was further complicated \nbecause NASAs Launch Services Program \(LSP NLS-2 new contract would be in \nplace and which vehicles would be initially available in the \ntimeframe SMAP expected a launch vehicle selection. \nThe Project also simultaneously explored whether a \npartnership with the DOD Space Test Program \(STP DOD agencies have high interest in \nusing SMAP data in their applications [3] and were strong \nadvocates to the STP for such a partnership. Under such a \npartnership, the DOD might have earlier access to critically nneeded soil moisture and freeze-thaw data to support their \napplications and NASA would realize a substantially lower \nmission cost. STP has occasional access to EELVs and more \nfrequent access to Minotaur IV vehicles. The Minotaur IV \nuses components with a significant flight heritage such as \nsurplus Peacekeeper stages, a Taurus fairing and attitude \ncontrol system, and a mix of Minotaur I, Pegasus, Taurus, \nand other Orbital Sciences standard avionics and software \n[24]. The use of surplus Peacekeeper stages means the nvehicle was defined by NASA to be a non-commercial \nlaunch system under the Commercial Space Act and ntherefore, it is not available for NASA acquisition. The Act \nallows for Minotaur use by DOD under certain ncircumstances that appeared potentially allowable for SMAP \nunder a DOD partnership. The Minotaur IV had not yet \nflown at that time, but it appeared to be a good potential \nmatch for SMAP. The potential cost benefit to NASA of a \nDOD partnership was substantial, especially given the \nuncertainties in the commercial acquisition process, and for \na time, the DOD partnership track seemed like the most \nlikely prospect for a launch vehicle for SMAP. For these \nreasons, SMAP strove to develop an observatory that \nmaintained Minotaur IV compatibility \(the + variant \nreplaces the Orion 38 upper stage with a Star 48 which \nprovides more lift capability preliminary and then \ndetailed final design until CDR in July 2012, when NASA \nannounced selection of a Delta II launch vehicle for SMAP. \nPersistent launch vehicle uncertainty drove SMAP towards \nmission and observatory designs that maintained \ncompatibility with several launch vehicles: Minotaur IV+, \nAtlas V, Falcon 9 and then later the Delta II when it was on-\nramped onto NLS-2 in October 2011. In most aspects, the \nMinotaur IV represented the most constraining vehicle \nchoice. The largest drivers were its 92-in fairing, and its lift ncapability constraint and non-restartable upper stage, which \nlimited its final orbit insertion capability for SMAP. \nTypically in early formulation before launch vehicle \nselection, missions employ enveloping and highly margined \ndesign environments for compatibility with likely launch \nvehicles. Launch vehicle selection is typically completed by \nmission PDR so that as the observatory enters the final \ndesign phase, expected launch load requirements decrease \naround the selected vehicle and maturing coupled loads and \nmission analyses. The easing of requirements allows fewer \ndesign iterations \(margin is cashed in to address problems \n \nFigure 23. Frequency separation is the key to meet stability and performance requirements while not responding to \ndisturbances.  \n  16\nthat arise in the detailed design and highly margined loads environment \npersisted through the entire design lifecycle, which in turn \ndrove more design iterations to insure the design was \ncompatible with the higher loads cases. \nThe 92-in fairing constraint significantly drove the \nobservatory packaging to achieve a compact design. The \nspacecraft bus underwent several design iterations to package \navionics, power, and radar electronics designs as the 


nassociated electronics packaging designs matured, while also \naccommodating commercial space assemblies for other \nsubsystems [transponders, transmitters, miniature inertial \nmeasurement unit \(MIMUs etc The packaging \nrequirements contributed to decisions to develop the NVM \nslice within the C&DH to avoid having to accommodate a \nseparate solid state data recorder assembly. Harness design \nwas a challenge to accommodate difficult bends and close \nclearances. The structure design was also optimized to reduce \nmass to insure healthy margins against the Minotaur IV+ lift \ncapability. The spacecraft structure was designed with 7050 naluminum alloy and the structure includes a number of \nmachined cutouts and thin walls that are time-consuming to \nfabricate. Thermal control was also a challenge in such a \nsmall bus due to the power dissipations \(~1400 W complexity; but nearly every available exterior \nsurface is used as a radiator. \nPerhaps most significantly impacted by the 92-in fairing \nconstraint were the stowed RBA and solar array packaging. \nThe RBA has been the most sensitive assembly to launch \nvehicle uncertainty, undergoing several design iterations to \naddress stowed packaging and launch loads, and thermal \ndesign iterations to address evolving launch phase mission ndesign scenarios. The RBA along with the spin assembly is \nso intimately coupled to the observatorys fundamental \narchitecture that these contracts were initiated early in Phase \nA; however the RBA is now the last flight assembly to be \ndelivered to observatory integration and test, less than one \nyear before launch because the start of flight manufacturing \nwas delayed until the design work could be stabilized and nconfirmed for the selected launch vehicle. \nThe solar array design was also driven by the 92-in fairing nconstraint. Unusually, SMAPs solar array has no exposed \ncells when stowed. Because of the small bus size the \nadjacent sizes of the spacecraft to the solar array central \npanel are busy and close clearances to the fairing envelope \nwould not allow for a wrap around solar panel stowage \napproach. The solar array folds over on itself, placing the \noutboard cells facing inward. This feature places high \nemphasis on ensuring there are robust battery energy \nmargins available to accommodate solar array deployment \ncontingencies following launch vehicle separation. \nThe mission design for orbit insertion was also developed \ninitially around the Minotaur IV+ vehicle capability. The \nMinotaur IV+ upper stage is not restartable and to naccommodate disposal requirements, the initial target \nspecification placed the upper stage/observatory in an nelliptical orbit \(566 x 664 km timeframe, but \ndrove the spacecraft propulsion system to accommodate the \nadditional delta V \(and propellant capacity 685 km also enabled the maximum achievable \ndry mass on-orbit for the observatory, subject to the need for \n80-kg propellant tank capacity on board the spacecraft. \nTo accommodate the Delta II selection, the existing Launch nVehicle Adapter \(LVA interfaces \n\(Figure 24 upper stage is restartable, \nthe mission design was adapted to directly inject SMAP into \nits final science orbit. Additional secondary batteries were \nadded to the LVA to provide appropriate power margins \nduring the longer coast phase until separation and solar \narray deployment places the spacecraft on internal power n\(Minotaur IV+ injection time was 16 minutes, Delta II is 60 \nminutes increased mass and fairing \nvolume resources than the Minotaur IV+; unfortunately, \nwhen the Delta II was selected, the SMAP design was \n \nFigure 24. SMAPs launch vehicle adapter design \naccommodates changes needed for late launch vehicle \nselection. \n  17\nmature and many subsystems were well into fabrication. It \nwas not cost effective to iterate through another design cycle \nto take advantage of the additional resources. The added \ndesign and development effort to remain compliant with the \nMinotaur IV+ have ultimately allowed SMAP to \naccommodate a late launch vehicle selection without \nstretching out the development schedule or launch ready \ndate, thereby allowing SMAP to retain its October 2014 \nlaunch ready date despite the launch vehicle uncertainty. \n11. LESSONS LEARNED \nSMAP has significantly benefited from the experience and \nlessons from Aquarius and SMOS for the science \nmeasurements and instrument design, and from MSL for the \navionics and power subsystem architectures. Personnel from \nthese predecessor missions were engaged early in SMAPs ndevelopment so that their insight and lessons learned could \nbe integrated into the early architectural design stages. \nKey lessons learned from SMAP include: \n\(1 nplanned scenarios very early with regulatory functions \nand key stakeholders. Spaceborne L-band science nradars operate as secondary users within their allocated \nspectrum. The primary users, civil and defense aircraft \nterrestrial navigation systems, are increasingly wary \nabout potential interference from secondary users. \nSMAP conducted significant analysis and testing to \ndemonstrate very low interference risk potential 


and \ncoordinated the results with these users early. SMAP \nmade significant modifications to the radar design and \noperating approach to effectively eliminate risk of \ninterference to primary spectrum users. \n\(2 the launch vehicle early; this is particularly \nimportant for new observatory designs where the \nnumber of design iterations can be driven by assumed \nconstraints and conservative bounding environments \n\(especially if they persist into detail design packaging, repackaging to \nremain within fairing envelope, for instance iterations, and mission design \niterations to accommodate various launchers before a \nfinal launch selection was made. This was unavoidable \nfor SMAP given SMAPs launch vehicle and other \ncircumstances.  \n\(3 Integrated observatory designspacecraft and \ninstrumentSMAP is a highly integrated design that \nuniquely leverages spacecraft capabilities to simplify \ninstrument design and operation. This resulted in lower noverall design complexity and has also allowed for a \nmore reliable design by reducing the number of npossible major failure modes.  \n\(4 new design insights incrementally \nunfold and thereby often reveal new issues to be \nresolved within the design. Occasional team resets \nwere imposed to reassess local requirements and design \ncomplexity within the context of the overall observatory \ndesign. These resets often resulted in significant \nsimplification and in reduced development risk and \nuncertainty. \n\(5 napply resources to mature these design areas, and \nqualify critical essential electronics parts and nsubassemblies to reduce downstream risk. SMAP \nsuccessfully did this, aggressively applying resources to nradar, radiometer, avionics, spin/dynamics and control, \nand the RBAthe key development challenges for the nmission. As described earlier, the RBA and spin \nassemblies designs were fundamental to the \narchitectural definition and to enabling preliminary \ndesign to proceed, so these were selected early in \nFormulation and placed under contract. This reduced \nsubsystem architectural- and system-level redesign \ncycles that can set back progress. \n12. CONCLUSION \nThe SMAP observatory has been carefully designed to \naddress a number of unique challenges posed by the mission \nobjectives: \n? Achieving global coverage every 23 days with a single ninstrument and observatory \n? Achieving both high resolution and high soil moisture \naccuracy \n? Minimizing data loss or corruption from L-band \nterrestrial RFI \n? Using a deployable mesh reflector for L-band nradiometric measurements \n? Mechanical packaging of the large instrument antenna \nand spacecraft, with its associated structural design \ncompatibility with several small-to-medium class launch \nvehicles and to accommodate a relatively late vehicle \nselection without delaying launch. \n? Fault protection approach to minimize science \nmeasurement on-orbit down-time \n? Adapting planetary heritage avionics to an Earth science nmission application \n? Design for EMC to avoid L-band emissions that could \ndegrade science measurements \n Dynamics and pointing control of a large deployable \nspinning reflector \nThe design ensures that SMAP will provide high-quality \nscience data. \n  18\nREFERENCES \n[1] Earth Science and Applications from Space: National nImperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond, \nCommittee on Earth Science and Applications from \nSpace: A Community Assessment and Strategy for the \nFuture, National Research Council, The National \nAcademic Press 2007.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
