This paper reports on a study of public text chat in BZFlag, an open source capturethe-flag game in which user avatars are tanks. Chat data were analyzed using methods of content and dis 
course analysis, including analyzing the coherence of extended conversations. The findings reveal that public chat is used actively in BZFlag, primarily to react to and negotiate game play, and that extended conversations occur intermittently and are surprisingly coherent. Implications are discussed for multitasking, classifying multiplayer online games, and enhancing the chatability or chat usability, of first-person shooter game designs  1. Introduction  In recent years, multiplayer online games \(MOGs have generated much popular and scholarly interest [3 15, 18, 19 of te n a llo w us ers to ch at du ri ng play, either via voice or, more commonly, synchronous text. However, while a number of studies have com 
mented on this phenomenon, it has rarely been their focus, with the result that the uses and characteristics of MOG chat remain largely unexplored MOG chat deserves study for a number of reasons First, it is a type of convergent media computermediated communication computer-mediated communication \(CMC\hat takes place in a convergent media format in which it is secondary, by design, to other information or entertainment-related activities  In th e cas e of MOG ch at, th e prim a r y act i v i t y i s  game play; MOGs are designed first and foremost with 
that in mind. Focusing squarely on the chat aspect rather than game design or game play can provide a revealing lens through which to understand CMC more generally, as well as suggesting design improvements from a CMC perspective that may be less obvious from a game design perspective Relatedly, playing a game and chatting at the same time involves multitasking, or media coactivity 2  which two or more synchronized or coordinated media are used simultaneously or in alternation. How users distribute their attention across media content, espe 
cially in MOGs in which game play is fast-paced and continuous, can shed light on how multitasking works and what devices and platforms best facilitate it These considerations are especially relevant for text chat that takes place in first-person online multiplayer games of the type commonly called first-person shooters FPS\his game type can be distinguished from massively multiplayer online role-playing games MMORPGs\ a number of dimensions, one of which, we propose, is the nature of the chat that takes 
place in them. While chatting in MMORPGs has attracted some scholarly attention th e  uses and characteristics of chat in first-person online multiplayer games are less well understood. How actively do users chat, with whom, about what, and how coherently, when they are shooting enemies and dodging bullets in a fast-paced virtual gaming environment To begin to address these questions, we report on an analysis of public text chat conversations in BZFlag an open source capture-the-flag type game in which user avatars are tanks and text chat is the only in-game communication option. Methods of textual content and 
discourse analysis, supplemented with reference to game play in the 3D graphical environment, are used to analyze chat logs from two kinds of league play The results reveal that public chat is used actively in BZFlag, primarily to react to and negotiate game play. These uses of chat reflect the fast pace of the first-person shooter, which requires players to focus on the game at all times. As such, they contrast with the findings of previous studies of MMORPGs, in which chat was reportedly used for creating and maintaining social relationships [15, 20   a d ve r t i s i ng o r ne go t i a t i n g  
serv en tdri v e n learn i ng 16]. Yet although most BZFlag chat is not interactive, it is social in nature, and extended chat exchanges occur intermittently that are surprisingly coherent, especially in active games with larger numbers of players. These findings show that sociability can be achieved even when attentional resources are severely taxed, and suggest that socializing can be a motivation for multitasking Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


In concluding, the implications of these findings for situating FPS chat in relation to other modes of convergent media CMC and for multitasking research are considered. We advance several design recommendations for enhancing the chatability or chat usability, of MOGs such as BZFlag, arguing that the traditional CMC design desideratum of persistence is less useful for fast-paced environments than interface designs that optimize the efficient management of attention across multiple, dynamically-changing content areas  2. Background  2.1. BZFlag game overview  BZFlag \(short for Battle Zone capture the Flag\a multiplayer online first-person shooter game in which players navigate tanks, from a first-person person perspective, across a playing field, referred to as a map. A map can support up to 200 players and four separate teams; however, games usually involve around 30 players divided between two teams. Game play broadly consists of eliminating players from the opposing team a task that is typically part of an overarching game objective, such as capturing an opposing team s flag and returning it to one s own team. To assist in this goal, players can pick up superflags flags that are scattered across the map and provide special powers such as better weapons or faster movement speed Unlike FPSs such as Doom  Counter-Strike  Jedi Knight II and Quake BZFlag is open source. Players can not only download and play the game for free, they can also view and submit changes to the source code The maps on which game play takes place are also developed by players; they vary in thematic content from traditional venues \(such as a forest\whimsical venues such as outer space or a person s home. Upon logging into the game, one can choose from hundreds of servers and maps, but participants tend to congregate around a handful of servers that contain maps that have become player favorites over time BZFlag was first released publicly in 1993 and has been continuously updated since. Currently, there are more than 11,000 registered players on forums and more than 200 servers running continuously, although most interaction takes place on 10 to 20 servers. Some dedicated players have formed leagues with established game play rules and maps. Play in leagues emphasizes the use of skills and map knowledge, usually identified through strategic positioning and the use of ricochet shots which rely on the geometry of objects on the playing field to direct bullets around obstacles to predictable destinations Game play requires the player to divide his attention \(most BZFlag players are male\ among six different dynamic areas of the screen. These are circled and numbered in Figure 1, which shows a screenshot of the playing field on one map. Navigation is accomplished by moving one s mouse within the square central mousebox 4\whose outer edges are scales indicating the player s current position and orientation. In the lower left corner, a radar screen \(#6\ives a bird s-eye overview of the map and the positions of teammates and opponents. Chat appears at the bottom center of the screen \(#5\g with game play status messages such as recent kills and flags grabbed\The most recent chat and important status messages also appear briefly at the top center of the screen \(#1\ the top left \(#3\dividual player scores are listed \(the player s userID and email are on the right, and various scores in different columns are on the left\while team scores \(flag captures\ appear near the top right \(#2  Figure 1. BZFlag game interface  The BZFlag game design results in a hectic, fastpaced gaming experience. New players find themselves quickly targeted and eliminated in one or two shots by more experienced players. However, player death does not result in elimination for the duration of the game Instead, one only needs to press a mouse button in order to respawn at a randomized starting location with a new tank, ready to re-engage in battle  2.2. Literature review  2.2.1. MMORPGs  Research on chat in online games has focused primarily on massively multiplayer online role-playing games \(MMORPGs\ch as Everquest  Ultima  Online  and World of Warcraft These are computer-generated graphical virtual environments in which a player creates a digital avatar \(called a character\with which s/he interacts with other players characters in a shared space. Content is usually rendered in a third person Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


view, and the environment presents a distinctive theme for example, fantasy or science fiction\ression or advancement in the game is driven by receiving upgrades, items, and new powers on one s characters these upgrades accumulate over game play sessions The attraction of participating in a MMORPG, for many players, is its social nature. Steinkuehler and Williams ok i n g Olde n b u r g  aracteris tics of third places argue that MMORPG environments serve as bridging mechanisms supporting informal sociability, similar to traditional social venues such as bars and coffee shops. Game play in these environments is structured to promote collaboration by providing incentives to work with other participants By participating in brief or extended collaborations players engage in a process of socialization and learning ers  m a y als o ch oos e to participate in  online gaming, drawn to the idea of being alone together as opposed to simply being alon Although MMORPGs are visually and auditorily rich environments, the dominant form of player-toplayer communication is text. Steinkuehl observed that chat utterances in Lineage Online are cryptic and filled with contextual abbreviations. Nardi, Ly and Harris aracterized ch at in  World of Warcraft as playful and enlivened by positive emotional interaction. The scope, quality, and attributes of textual communication in MMORPGs also vary depending on the environment. For example, Ducheneaut and Moore  erv e d th at in  Star Wars Galaxies player chat ranged from advertising, short interactions, and the exchange of services to longer meaningful exchanges depending on the location within the game The above research suggests that the features that unite textual communication in the various MMORPG environments are its promotion of socializing and the creation and maintenance of social ties through ongoing textual communication among participants  2.2.2. First-person shooters  In contrast, the first person shooter \(FPS\enre is characterized by direct competition with other players In each game session, players start out on an equal footing; it is play skill, awareness of the environment and effective teamwork that primarily distinguish experienced players from rookies FPS environments are less persistent than MMORPGs. Once game play in an FPS has finished the world is reset to the state it was in at the start of play, or a new environment \(e.g., playing field\ made available. In contrast, MMORPG worlds are persistent meaning that there is only one environment in which players participate, and this environment can evolve over time based on player actions or other environmental factors programmed by the game designers. This evolution can proceed in phases, by continuously following a game narrative or by responding to player input. In FPSs, in contrast, game play tends to be active, continuous, and focused on a single overall goal As in MMORPGs, chat in FPSs tends to be textual Wright et h eir ex a m in at ion o f creati v e  player action in Counter-Strike identified and coded five general categories of discourse: creative game talk, game conflict talk, insult/distancing talk, performance talk, and game technical/external talk. The predominant categories were game conflict talk \(banning of players, cheat accusations, camping accusations and game performance talk \(related to performance scores, recent kills, and game strategy n i n e n and Kujanp al y zed f o r m s of i n teractio n i n  Battlefield 1942 another FPS. They found that communication primarily takes place via predefined voice and text messages, with text chat used mostly to elaborate on these predefined utterances These studies findings suggest that chatting in FPSs is closely tied to the game itself; the creation and maintenance of social ties and socializing is not as incessant and ubiquitous  in MMO R P Gs Ho w ever, a study of another FPS Jedi Knight II found that socioemotional communication was more frequent than task-based communication reov er, p o sitiv e  socioemotional communication, acting as a tension release, was three times more prevalent than negative socioemotional communication [18  su gge st i n g t h a t  friendly socializing was taking place Relatedly, in a study of cooperation and disruptive behavior in Counter-Strike Hahsler and Koch found that 50% of the logged communication contained emotional content \(either negative or positive Gameplay communication, such as strategy coordination communicated via short utterances, was the second most popular category, making up 25% of the captured player communication One limitation of the available research is that it tends to consider chat utterances essentially as independent units, without analyzing their relation to one another or the overall coherence of chat exchanges. As a consequence, the conversational properties of MOG chat of either type or even the extent to which chat utterances exchanged during game play should be considered conversation remain largely unknown  3. Research question and hypotheses  The overall research question addressed in this study is the following RQ: How actively do players in a in a fast-paced virtual gaming environment chat, with whom, about what and how coherently Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


We hypothesize that time and attentional constraints will affect the nature of chat in BZFlag. Specifically H1: Messages will be short and abbreviated, moreso than in other modes of recreational chat H2: Participation in chat will be limited H3: Most messages will be on themes relating to game play H4: Most chat messages will not respond to any other message, and conversations will be short and fragmented, relative to other modes of recreational chat  4. Methodology  4.1. Data  The data for this study are drawn from Games United \(GU\eague games played on servers hosted by a player named Quol and publicly posted to his server archive website. The GU league is a semiformal association of BZFlag players who organize teams to play official and fun i.e., unofficial matches involving teams of 2 to 20 players on a specific map. GU league rules prohibit superflags, but make use of BZFlag s jumping and ricochet settings. Games are two- or four-team capture the flag mode games only two-team games are analyzed in this study Games are timed, lasting precisely 30 minutes of playing time, although the clock may be paused The GU league has an international player base with especially large numbers of players in Europe and the United States. At the time of our data collection in November 2007, over 2,000 games were available in the archives, dating back to February, 2007. Since the game files are publicly posted, we needed only to set up a server configured to replay saved games in order to view them as many times as desired Use of these data also imposes certain limitations We can only view the games as observers, which means we can only see public chat; admin\(istrator team, and private chat channels are inaccessible Moreover, the data are all from a single game mode and a single map, and GU league games typically involve fewer players than are found on public servers Thus the findings of this study may not generalize to BZFlag games on public servers Two samples of chat were constructed for the purposes of this study. To represent typical GU league game chat, we collected a random sample \(~10%\f all games \(N=378\n a two-month period in fall 2007 and extracted a systematic sub-sample of 25-message sequences from the resulting 37 random games, for a total of 900 messages. This is referred to henceforth as the random sample or random games To represent the most active chat, we collected an exhaustive sample of all active games with 15 or more participants \(N=12 these are referred to henceforth as the active games   4.2. Analytical methods  The chat data were analyzed using methods of content and discourse analysis that drew for their interpretation on game play in the 3D graphical environment We replayed the video logs of the games multiple times, viewing them from different players perspectives, in order to understand what chat utterances were responding to and how they should be interpreted The first two methods involved straightforward structural measures. To determine the complexity of the chat, message and word lengths were measured in the random game sample. It was assumed that short words and short messages, relative to other modes of chat \(such as Internet Relay Chat or social MUDs would indicate a low degree of complexity. To answer the question of how actively players chat, we measured messages per player and per second and compared the results for random and active games To address the question of what players were chatting about, it was necessary to study the video logs of the games, since utterances often addressed game play actions. We employed thematic content analysis to classify and count the main theme of each chat message in a random portion of the random sample. The themes were allowed to emerge from the data. The themes that emerged were: react to game play; negotiate game play; off-game topic; greet; respond to a game play reaction; comment on a technical problem or the technical status of a player; and other The video logs also proved valuable in analyzing the interactivity and coherence of the chat, particularly for the information they provided about timing. Often the difference in coding an utterance as a response to another or not depended on how much time had elapsed between the two utterances: if more than a few seconds, given the fast pace of the game, the utterances were usually unrelated. The percentage of messages that responded to another chat message was first calculated and then compared for random and active games Finally, Dynamic Topic Analysis \(DTA d VisualDTA w e re e m plo y e d to an al y z e an d g r aph i cally display the coherence of the conversations that occurred during the active games. DTA is a method for identifying and quantifying message interrelatedness over time; it visually represents the flow and coherence of online conversations. VisualDTA is a tool that partially automates the generation of DTA diagrams. DTA has been used to visualize other modes of chat [8, 9  i n g  f o r co m p aris ons  w i t h BZFlag c h at  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


5. Results  5.1. Complexity of chat  The chat messages in the random sample are very short: only 1.4 words on average. By way of comparison, in previous studies, recreational \(multi-participant Internet Relay Chat messages were found to average 4 to 6 words d m e s s a g e s in a s o cial MUD a v eraged 6 to 7 words in groups of three or more participants and 10 to 14 words in dyads  Words in the random sample are also short, with an average of 3.5 characters. In previous English chat studies, words average around 4 characters  T h is  may seem like a small difference, but it is not, considering that English words tend to average less than 5 characters even in formal written \(asynchronous\course  Contributing to the brevity of BZFlag chat messages is the frequent use of cryptic abbreviations, many of which are specific to the game. Table 1 is an example of a joking exchange based on the use of game-specific abbreviations for superflags 2   Table 1. Example of a chat exchange Time PlayerID Message 18:39:05 grand slam who has OO 18:39:27 menotume i have sb 18:39:36 grand slam get WG or T 18:39:50 menotume would prefer st  In this example OO stands for oscillation overthruster  a superflag that enables a tank to go through walls sb  stands for superbullets a superflag that allows one to shoot through walls WG means wings and T means tiny both useful superflags to defend against superbullets\d st stands for stealth a superflag that makes one invisible on radar A number of other game-specific abbreviations were noted in non-joking contexts, as well \(see below along with many common CMC abbreviations \(such as lol, omg, brb, thx, afk, wtf gl hf - good luck have fun \(used as a greeting fm - fun match offi - official ns - nice shot cap - \(flag\ture tk - team kill sk - self-kill nr - not responding obs, obsies - observers gg - good game    2 Given that GU league games do not have superflags, this exchange is clearly intended to be humorous The use of abbreviation can be seen as an effective strategy to communicate under extreme time pressure using minimal keystrokes. Thus, while the chat is structurally very simple, it is simple in a strategic way  5.2. Participation in chat   Surprisingly, most players engaged in public chat despite the availability of other chat channels that might serve their teams more effectively \(such as team chat\nd the fact that typing chat messages necessarily takes time and effort away from shooting enemy tanks In the random sample, which averaged 7.8 players per game, 90% of the players posted at least one public chat message. In the active sample, which averaged 16.3 players per game, 84% of the players chatted publicly. The average number of messages posted per chatter was similar in the two samples: 12.7 in the random sample \(range: 1 to 47\ and 12.9 in the active sample range: 1 to 77 messages As regards the rate of chatting activity, in the random sample, a public chat message was posted every 14.8 seconds on average, whereas in the active sample a public message was posted every 10.1 seconds While this may seem slow, most players also chat with their teams and/or privately, in addition to playing the game. Thus, the level of activity in the public chat channel can be considered moderate, with more chatting taking place in games with more participants  5.3. Chat message content  In order to analyze the content of the messages that were posted during game play, thematic analysis of the players' chat was conducted for part of the random sample. Table 2 summarizes the findings  Table 2. Thematic content of chat messages React to game play Negotiate game play Offgame topic Greet Respond to reaction Tech problem status Other Total 156 55 3 18 26 15 2 275 56.7 20 1.1 6.5 9.5% 5.5% 0.7 100  The majority of the messages \(56.7%\ere reactions to game play. This use is illustrated in the sequence in Table 3 3 which is typical. The second most frequent chat content involved negotiation of game play \(20 followed by responses to reactions to game play 9.5%\These uses are described further below   3 Time intervals in Table 3 suggest that most of the reactions were responding to separate game play events \(time stamps were added by the researchers  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5

Examples of reactions to game play 2:46:27 tankzilla works 2:46:54 Ginny oopsa 2:47:36 Ginny rofl 2:47:37 A Vicious Muffin hehe 2:47:54 A Vicious Muffin uh.. \(after G shot A her teammate 2:48:02 A Vicious Muffin lol 2:48:22 tankzilla ROFLMAO 2:48:30 A Vicious Muffin  2:48:31 anteater ops 2:48:36 anteater cool 2:48:36 A Vicious Muffin lol 2:48:37 Ginny wierd 2:48:51 tankzilla nah 2:49:14 A Vicious Muffin gah 2:49:54 A Vicious Muffin harumph 2:51:06 tankzilla smsh 2:51:49 tankzilla oh that sucked  5.4. Extended chat sequences  Despite most chat utterances being one-word exclamations in reaction to game play, longer, interactive sequences of messages also occurred. In the random sample, 40% of messages responded to another message, and thus were at least minimally interactive. In comparison, in the active game with the most interactions, 47% of messages were responses The distribution of extended exchanges in the same active game is shown in the VisualDTA diagram in Figure 2. In the diagram, message numbers \(assigned by the researchers based on chronological order of posting\ are along the y-axis, and the x-axis shows the cumulative semantic distance between messages, manually assigned according to the degree a message relates to the message to which it is logically responding Each message is also labeled for its topical relation to a preceding message: T \(narrowly on-topic\ \(parallel shift\, or B \(break\. By convention, T s always have a semantic distance of 0, and B s always have a distance of 4 from the first message in the sample. Strings of T s or B s thus produce a vertical line, whereas diagonal lines are produced by P s, which can have a semantic distance from 1 to 3, and indicate that topical development is taking place [8 P r ev iou s res earch h a s  shown that coherent conversations in Internet Relay Chat and instant messaging, when visualized in DTA tend to exhibit a diagonal step-wise progression from upper left to lower right [8, 9  In contrast, Figure 2 shows an overall vertical development \(produced largely by reactions to game play, which are mostly B s\his is interrupted by intermittent exchanges, which appear as branching structures \(circled\ the vertical line. The topics of the exchanges are labeled to the right of the diagram   Figure 2. Overview of public chat in an active game  It is notable that the exchanges seem to occur at regular intervals, and that they are approximately the same length \(about 25 messages\uggesting constraints on how much interaction is possible during active game play. Within these constraints, however the exchanges that occur can be surprisingly complex and coherent  Figure 3 shows a close-up of the second exchange labeled negotiating game play in Figure 2. This exchange is notable for the efficiency with which the number of players per team is renegotiated after two players leave the game. Despite the potential confusion caused by three parallel threads \(labeled in Figure 3 game play was resumed with a new team configuration in only 25 messages and approximately one minute this transition was accomplished entirely through chat Note the frequent use of abbreviations in this exchange g2g, brb, gg, 6v6, cu, fm, k  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


  Figure 3. A sequence negotiating game play   Another remarkable sequence is shown in Figure 4. While game play is actively ongoing, a player engages with two other players over a period of two minutes regarding living conditions in Switzerland where he is thinking of moving. With the exception of the game play reactions in the background, this conversation is as coherent as any dyadic instant messaging exchange, in that it is continuous and progresses in a diagonal, step-wise fashion h is s e q u en ce is  unique in our data, in that it is the only conversation that is purely social and unrelated to the game    Figure 4. A coherent off-topic sequence  Figure 5. Deviant game with a cheating episode  Another exception is shown in Figure 5. In this active game, a player called The Cookie Monster was caught in an alleged act of cheating, although the nature of the cheat was somewhat ambiguous, and not all of the players saw it happen. A flurry of questions attempts to describe what happened, and accusations followed the initial incident. Predictably, after about 25 chat messages, a player attempted to restart game play the clock had been paused after the suspicious incident\t the restarted game soon encountered a glitch that led to another negotiation, and the same thing happened again shortly thereafter. In the meantime, the cheating incident continued to be discussed, culminating eventually in a string of apologies followed by some silly word play \(which seemed to be an expression of relief\ore game play resumed nearly 100 messages after the original incident This is an exception that proves the rule, in that when the normal pattern reactions to game play interspersed with brief exchanges was disrupted, a seProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


quence of redressive actions followed. Through it all other players attempted to preserve the implicit norm of chat exchanges no longer than 25 messages, and sought repeatedly \(and eventually, successfully\ to return to normal game play  6. Discussion  This study asked how actively users chat, with whom, about what, and how coherently, in one fastpaced FPS gaming environment. The hypotheses and the study s findings are summarized below H1: Messages will be short and abbreviated, moreso than in other modes of recreational chat Strongly supported H2: Participation in chat will be limited Not supported H3: Most messages will be on themes relating to game play Supported H4: Most chat messages will not respond to any other message, and most conversations will be short and fragmented, relative to other modes of recreational chat Partially supported. Stretches of one-off game reactions are periodically interspersed with more coherent, interactive sequences The findings that chat messages are short and abbreviated and that most chat concerns the game itself either as comments on events in the game or negotiation of gameplay reflect the temporal and attentional demands that the game makes on players. It seems that shooting tanks and chatting at the same time is not easy to do. As one long-time BZFlag player emailed to one of the authors I usually play while talking, and I usually get killed while I'm typing However, he went on to add For some reason it doesn't bother me too much - and I've found that the people I'm talking to sometimes get killed while typing too This comment underscores that chatting in BZFlag is an activity that may be enjoyed for social reasons, even when it interferes with effective game play  The social gratifications available through game chat may also explain why players chat publicly as much as they do, even though it gains them little advantage in the game. The player quoted above stated I find it a bit boring to play too much, but the one thing I've really enjoyed is the text chat. With the right people on a map, it can be hilarious  Sometimes hilarity emerges from the exchange of cryptic utterances, as in the example in Table 1. Sometimes one-off reactions to one s own game play \(Table 3\ be a sociable way to be alone together   And sometimes actual conversations take place, which although they tend to be limited in scope, can be engaging and unexpectedly coherent These findings reflect to some extent the specific game play features of BZFlag. One such feature is that when the need to stop game play arises, players must indicate this via the chat interface. For example, if a player wishes to bring another player into the game as a substitute, he announces his intention in the chat interface and asks the other participants to pause their game play. The game is paused when all participants cease ongoing hostilities and remain at their current position in the playing field. This feature provides an incentive for players to monitor the chat display more regularly than they might otherwise, lest they miss this important signal. Regular attention, in turn, helps to explain the relatively high degree of coherence some conversations in BZFlag chat achieve Another feature is that when a player is eliminated he is not removed for the duration of the remaining game; instead he respawns with a new tank. As a result of this, a player is constantly engaged in action and does not have an extended period of free time during which to communicate with his team, the opposition or observers of the game. In other FPSs \(e.g CounterStrike  America s Army yer death results in removal from game play for the remaining duration of the round. This puts a player in observer mode and allows him to view the rest of the match as a spectator, during which time he may engage in conversation with other spectators. The design of BZFlag thus leaves less time than other FPS games for chat, which may contribute to the abbreviated, task-focused character of chat in the game More generally, these differences could account for why our study found less social activity than some other studies of FPS ch e v e r, it is al s o  possible that our results are less different from theirs than they seem. What was coded as socioemotional  communication in other studies appears to be similar to what we coded as game play reactions see Table 3 If so, then the findings of studies of chat in FPSs are in fact quite consistent; taken together, they underscore the need to distinguish systematically between MMORPGs and FPSs in MOG chat research  7. Conclusions  7.1. Implications   In addition to providing evidence that supports a principled distinction between MMORPGs and FPSs which is important for game research, the present study contributes to a small but growing body of research Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


that seeks to understand and classify types of convergent media computer-mediated communication CMCMC\milar to other CMCMC such as comments posted to YouTube and Flickr and text messages sent from mobile phones to interactive television programs \(iTV SMS FP S ch at tak e s place in a v i sually engaging environment in which textual commenting/chat is secondary to the presentation of graphical content. In these environments, CMC consists mostly of one-off comments interspersed periodically with interactive exchanges, in which responses tend to reply to an immediately preceding message. FPS chat differs from other CMCMC, however, in that messages tend to focus on the stated purpose of the site \(the game\her than digressing onto other topics. Public chatting in BZFlag is also more interactive than comments posted to Flickr, YouTube, or iTV SMS. These differences can be attributed to the demanding nature of FPS game play and the smaller \(and thus more manageable\ber of participants in the game environment The study s findings have implications for multitasking research, as well. It has been claimed that the continuous partial attention required by multitasking causes errors due to insufficient attention [11 A c ti v i t y  interruption can also result in frustration and stress  In con t ras t th e BZF l a g res u lts  s ugg es t t h at f o r some users who chat while playing the game, the attention they allocate is largely sufficient for each task. For these successful multitaskers, factors such as youth and experience with the interface may favor success. For others, as suggested by the long-time player quoted above, the social benefits may outweigh the frustration and cost of making errors in game play indeed, a desire for social interaction may be what motivates BZFlag players to play and chat at the same time in the first place. These findings suggest perspectives that could be explored in research on multi-tasking in other, e.g., work, environments [11    7.2. Design recommendations   In a classic treatise on computer game design Crawfo u e d th a t un derl y i n g  techn i cal co n straints and possibilities strongly influence game play design and the resultant player experience. We suggest that the designed game environment also plays a role in shaping the quality and structure of chat discourse, and that chat usability, or chatability should be a design desideratum in MOGs, given that chatting is a major reason some online gamers play Past research suggests that persistent, reviewable text logs can promote interactional coherence in CMC 6 w e v e r, it see m s u n li k e l y th a t  m a k i n g B Z Fla g  chat more persistent would increase its coherence or usability, in that the pace of game play does not allow players to devote much attention to chat, regardless of how it is displayed or preserved 4  In FPSs, what is more important than textual persistence is the arrangement of the interface so as to optimize the efficient management of attention across multiple dynamic content areas. Research on multitasking suggests that gameplay and chat activity should be balanced so that one activity does not interrupt the other, to avoid frustration and stress T h e BZ F l a g  designers have attempted to do this: Chat is displayed next to the radar view, and both are immediately below the mousebox \(Figure 1\s players may keep the three most important areas in focal or peripheral vision at all times. However, the chat interface sometimes serves primarily as a peripheral information device; at those times, it would be helpful to minimize its distraction while maximizing its presentation of information  t oth e r ti m e s  t h e pres e n ce of co h e ren t continuous chat sequences suggests that the chat interface is the main locus of attention and would be better served by a more prominent representation. Enabling a player to toggle the chat interface between a peripheral and prominent state would be one possible solution to meet these variable needs Chat in BZFlag, like other multiparticipant CMC also suffers from disrupted adjacency of messages that are separated spatially from the messages to which they respon d co m m e n t s on  g a m e pla y are s p a tially and \(by the time they are posted\ temporally separated from the game play itself. To provide closer integration of these key activities and reduce the amount of attention shifting that players must do, chat messages could appear \(non-persistently\ above the tanks that posted them, as well as in the chat interface Finally, opportunities for communication without distraction in BZFlag are rare. If the designers of BZFlag wished to create an environment within the game that was conducive to socializing \(which, we argue, could increase the attractiveness of the game environment\hey could establish an area, such as a lobby, where players could congregate before and after games and chat in a more relaxed manner, without having to worry about their gameplay performance  7.3. Limitations and future research   This study examined public text chat in one league in one first-person shooter game. Team chat, private chat, and admin chat were not accessible, yet they are used to coordinate important activities, such as server   4 The BZFlag interface already gives players considerable control over the size of the chat window and the size of fonts, as well as allowing players to filter out different types of messages Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


maintenance and catching and sanctioning cheaters Moreover, game play and chat in the GU league differ from public server play, in that GU league play emphasizes teamwork and cooperation among players over individual prowess, whereas in public server play, individual differences in skill and the advantages of superflags can result in the appearance of unfair advantage, leading to taunting and complaining. These limitations could be addressed by analyzing a wider range of BZFlag activities and contexts Analysis of chat in other MOGs is also necessary in order to test the claim that chat differs systematically in MMORPGs and FPSs. Although the present study was limited to text chat, in-game voice chat is a growing trend in MOGs. Future research should analyze audio conversations, so as to determine the effects of modality on in-game chatting. Other methods, such as eye tracking, could also be used to investigate empirically how user attention is distributed dynamically across features of game interfaces Finally, the methods used in this study could be extended to non-gaming environments in which chat cooccurs with other media use. This would provide a broader comparative base from which to generalize about chat and chatability in coactive media  8.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
