nodes, and this gap becomes greater when the amount of DDSB nodes increase At the previous DDSB, non DDS nodes announce participation to DDSB nodes in the network. All DDSB nodes that receive these participating messages create DDS translation objects and connect them. When the network has m DDSB nodes and n non DDS nodes, each DDSB node makes connections to all n non DDS nodes, and each non DDS node is connected to all m DDSB nodes. In this case, the network has m *n connections. At the C DDSB, DDSB nodes choose a responsible node through the addressing algorithm at Chord after DDSB nodes recognize non DDS no des, and only the responsible DDSB node makes a connection to the non DDS node. As a result, the network has connections as the same number of non DDS nodes even if the network has numerous DDSB nodes and non DDS nodes This leads to the result s seen in Figure 8  V CONCLUSION In this paper, we applied a strategy of generating an address space at Chord to DDSB We re solved the problem s of connecting a small embedded device in a CPS System simultaneously to more than one DDSB  As a re sult, network traffic is reduced and load balancing of DDSB is possible C DDSB achieved load balancing via the distribution of embedded devices and DDSB nodes  and it performs error recovery and dynamically join/leave through a stabilization strategy  Wit h application of Chord we reduced the amount of information for maintaining an address space through reduction of a finger table The s ize of GUID is fixed to 96 bit s because the address space of DDS is not flexible With consideration of the characteristi cs of GUID it is necessary to research prevent ion avoi dance strateg ies for collision s generated by the hash at Chord  H and off problem s occur when the DDS entit ies are moved due to join/leave of connected embedded device s  We plan to study ways of reducin g the hand off problem ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was financially supported by the Ministry of Education \(MOE\ and National Research Foundation of Korea\(NRF\ through the Human Resource Training Project for Regional Innovation No 2013H1 B8A2032180  This work was partially supported by the IT R&D Program of MSIP/KEIT [10035708, "The Development of CPS\(Cyber Physical Systems\ Core Technologies for High Confidential Autonomic Control Software R EFERENCE 1 Lee, Edward A.
