A New Dimension of Parallelism in Ultra High Throughput LDPC Decoding Philipp Schl  afer Norbert Wehn Microelectronic Systems Design Research Group University of Kaiserslautern 67663 Kaiserslautern Germany Email  schlaefer wehn  eit.uni-kl.de Matthias Alles Timo Lehnigk-Emden Creonic GmbH 67663 Kaiserslautern Germany Email info@creonic.com Abstract In modern communication systems the required data rates are continuously increasing High speed transmissions can easily generate throughputs far beyond 1 Tbit/s To ensure error free communication channel codes like Low-Density Parity Check LDPC codes are utilized However state-of-the-art LDPC decoders can process only data rates in the range of 10 to 50 Gbit/s This results in a gap in decoder performance which has to be closed Therefore we propose a new ultra high speed LDPC decoder architecture We show that our architecture signiìcantly reduces the routing congestion which poses a big problem for fully parallel high speed LDPC decoders The presented 65nm ASIC implementation runs at 257 MHz and consumes an area of 12 mm 2  The resulting system throughput is 160 Gbit/s it is the fastest LDPC decoder which has been published up to now At the same time we show that extremely parallel architectures do not only increase the maximum throughput but also increase area and power efìciency in comparison to state-of-the-art decoders I I NTRODUCTION In todayês digitally connected society everybody is online all the time Due to the extensive use of bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications like YouTube HDTV and voice-overIP the bandwidth demand on wireless and wired communication channels is rapidly growing IEEE has completed the ratiìcation of the IEEE 802.3ba standard setting the target Ethernet speed as 100 Gbit/s F o r ber channel applications the upper limit is even higher early results show throughputs in the order of 100 Tbit/s At the same time efìcient forward error correction is required to ensure error free transmission To approach the channel capacity while serving high data rates LDPC codes are excellent candidates Today LDPC codes are used in a wide range of applications like 10 Gigabit Ethernet 10 GBASE-T IEEE802.3an broadband wireless communication UWB WiGig 5 and storage in hard disc drives Ev en though LDPC codes belong to the best channel coding schemes known today their implementation poses big challenges This is due to the iterative computationally expensive decoding procedure requiring massive parallel architectures to achieve the targeted throughput LDPC codes have been introduced by Gallager in 1962 but the high decoding complexity made the application at that time impossible When LDPC codes have been rediscovered in the late 90s the throughput demands have been moderate Serial decoder architectures have been sufìcient to fulìll the   Fig 1 H Matrix and Tanner Graph Hardware Mapping requirements As demands on the throughput rose partially parallel architectures became necessary Today fully parallel decoder architectures are required to satisfy applications like 10 GBASE-T As future standards emerge current architectures will not be able to facilitate the demanded throughputs of 100 Gbit/s and more However these high throughputs can only be achieved at the cost of exibility e.g IEEE 802.3an deìnes only one block length and code rate This makes new architectural approaches necessary In this paper we explore a new dimension of parallelism for LDPC channel decoders We propose to unroll the iterative decoding loop and instantiate a dedicated hardware for each iteration which is pipelined This allows for decoders processing one block per clock cycle The novel architecture reduces the routing congestion and latency This allows for a signiìcantly higher area and energy efìciency in comparison to state-ofthe-art architectures which make decoders with ultra high throughput of 100 Gbit/s and more feasible II LDPC D ECODING A LGORITHM LDPC codes are linear block codes deìned by a sparse parity check matrix H of dimension M  N  see Fig 1a A valid code word  x has to satisfy H x T   0 in modulo-2 arithmetic A descriptive graphical representation of the whole code is given by a Tanner graph Each row of the parity check matrix is represented by a check node CN and corresponds to one of the M parity checks Respectively each column corresponds to a variable node VN corresponding to one of the N code bits The Tanner graph shown in Fig 1b is the alternative representation for the parity check matrix of Fig 1a Edges in the Tanner graph reîect the 1ês in the H matrix There is an edge between VN n and CN m if and only if H mn 1  LDPC codes can be decoded by the use of different algorithms Which one ts best has to be chosen dependant on 153 2013 IEEE Workshop on Si g nal Processin g S y stems 978-1-4673-6238-2/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE 


the required communications performance For example the  min algorithm performs better than the min-sum algorithm  b u t has a signiìcantly higher implementation comple xity  In the following discussion we focus on the min-sum algorithm as it is used for our implementation All algorithms have in common that probabilistic messages are iteratively exchanged between variable and check nodes First the variable nodes are initialized with the channel values  ch n  According to the connections in the parity check matrix these values are passed from each variable node n with n  0   N  1  to the connected check nodes M  n  with M  n   m  m  0   M  1  H mn  0   1 The set of all variable nodes connected to check node m with m  0   M  1  is deìned as N  m   n  n  0   N  1  H mn  0   2 The check node computation can be split in two parts the actual parity check represented by the sign sgn    and the resultês probability represented by the magnitude     These extrinsic messages are computed as follows sgn    i  m  n    n  N  m   n sgn  z  i  n   m  3      i  m  n       min n  N  m   n   z  i  n   m    4 with the extrinsic scaling factor ESF   Finally the messages are returned to the variable nodes which generate new intrinsic messages z  i  for iteration i  z  i  n  m   ch n   m  N  n   m   i  1 m   n   i  1 n    i  1 m  n 5 with   i  n   ch n   m  M  n    i  m   n 6 The sign of the a posteriori probability  can be interpreted as the hard decision bit Message exchange between variable and check node continues until either a valid code word is found or a maximum number of iterations is exceeded What we described till now reîects a two-phase scheduling This schedule processes all check nodes before the variable nodes produce new messages However it is also possible to apply a so called layered scheduling 11 which is only applicable to partial parallel decoder architectures In the layered scheduling the check nodes are processed in a way that the variable nodes are intermediately updated Thus the remaining CNs can take results into account which have been generated in the same iteration The layered schedule can achieve the same communications performance as the twophase schedule while reducing the needed iterations by almost 50   Fig 2 LDPC Decoder Design Space III S TATE OF THE A RT LDPC D ECODER A RCHITECTURES The LDPC decoder design space comprises a multitude of parameters which have to be tuned to the speciìc requirements Each standard has different needs in means of error correction performance number of supported code rates codeword lengths and throughput There are numerous design decisions which have to be made for the hardware to satisfy the requirements We have presented an in depth investigation of the design space in In this paper we focus on the design decisions regarding parallelism The design space extension we present is exploring a new dimension of parallelism in LDPC channel decoding There are multiple dimensions in which the degree of parallelism can be chosen see Fig 2 The lowest level of parallelism is on the message level Each message can be transmitted in tuples of bits or fully parallel Today fully parallel message transfer can be found in the vast majority of architectures The second degree of parallelism can be found on processing node level The nodeês inand outgoing edges can be processed one after an other partially parallel or fully parallel However the choice of the nodeês edge parallelism is directly linked to the so called hardware mapping The hardware mapping is the highest level of parallelism which is used today It describes how many check and variable nodes are instantiated When we are talking of a fully parallel decoder an architecture instantiating all processing nodes is meant In contrast partially parallel decoders have a lower number of nodes than the Tanner graph They process the parity check matrix in a time multiplex fashion and thus have a very high decoding latency This allows for easy adaption of the architecture to new standards but limits the achievable throughput The edge parallelism is chosen to t the needs of the hardware mapping for example if only one submatrix is 154

To the best of our knowledge, there is no Chinese Microblogging service dataset for social influence analysis Therefore, we created a new Chinese Weibo dataset from Sina weibo service platform. The dataset consists of 2564 microblogs from 100 Microblogg ers during 2013-09-09 to 2013-09-15. And each Micro blogger published about 25 microblogs on average Firstly, we use the Root Mean Squared Error \(RMSE metrics to measure the prediction quality of our proposed approach in comparison with other matrix-based methods RMSE is defined as 2   is the predicted value for the original data Obviously, the smaller the metric the more precise the prediction result is Secondly, Precision at rank k \(P@k\is employed to evaluate the precision of our proposed approach. It is defined as the coincidence rate of the predicted ranking list and the ground truth ranking list for the top- k users     is the set of top-k users in the gold ranking list is the set of top-k users in the experimental ranking list In this section, in order to evalu ate the performance of our tensor factorization approach, we compare Tensor Factorization \(TF\with Matrix Factorization \(MF approach based on Chinese Weibo Dataset. Different numbers of latent feature is em ployed to test both of the approaches. The performance of RMSE with varying  values is shown in Figure 2. Compared with MF approach TF approach achieves consisten tly better performance with different number of latent feature  From Figure 2, as K increases, the RMSE also increases And the best RMSE of tensor factorization approach is achieved when K is set 2 Therefore, in the following experiments, we set 2   Fig 2: Performance Comparison on Different Values of are shown in Table 3.

Using our large citation data set we also perform speedup experiments on a Hadoop platform using 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 computer nodes. The experimental results are shown in Figure 4, where it is observed that speed-up ratio is rising with the increasing of no des. In particular, time on twelve nodes cost more than that on two nodes when Microbloggersê size is 100. The reason is that when the cloud platform dealing with small amount of data, the cost of task scheduling an d network communication overhead outperforms the time saving from nodeês increments.

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
