Application of Association Rules Mining in the System of University Teaching Appraisal  Zhang Jing-miao Computer Center Hebei University of Economics & Business Shijiazhuang,China zhang_jingmiao@163.com Gao Wei-xiao Information & Technology College Hebei University of Economics & Business Shijiazhuang,China renlixiaoyue@126.com   Abstract A large amount of data has accumulated in teaching appraisal that must be done every semester among most universities. In order to find out the law or model hidden in these data, the Data Mining technology should be used fully. This thesis introduces the application of Association Rules Mining in the teaching appraisal, which can effectively guide the teaching work by finding out the intrins ic association rules between the effectiveness of classroom teaching and teachersí age and title Keywords-Data Mining; Association Rules; Teaching Appraisal Support; Confidence I  I NTRODUCTION  As a basic link of the teaching practice -the quality assessment is an evaluation of teaching process and results by using the technical and theory of teaching appraisal, which aims to improve the teaching quality and to give standards of some kind of qualification of the estimated object Teaching appraisal is an important part of the teaching management and the primary means of teaching performance assessment. It can control, guide and promote the teaching practice and also has a strong or ientation. A large amount of data has accumulated during the investigation of teaching appraisal that must be engaged each semester in many universities. At present, the teaching appraisal mostly based on Numerical Methods just su mmarizes the assessment given by students and inform the teachers of the results that is the basis for teacherês promotion and excellent commentary and so on without deep thinking. Several traditional methods such as qualitative, quantitative assessment methods or StandardDeviation methods cannot be objective and accurate whereas it cannot to reflect the teaching actual situation indepth and can only reflects some sides of the teaching effectiveness. If the data mining tech nology is used in the teaching appraisal, the defects of traditional analysis methods in it can be amended. We can further explore the relationship between the teaching quality and the teachersê age and title also between the classroom teaching effectiveness and teachersê personal qualities. Based on the above mentioned, by reasonably deploying the teachers of a class, students will maintain a interest and motivati on to learn hard; by providing the decision-making information to teaching management teaching work will be promoted and teaching quality will be greatly improved II C ONCEPT OF A SSOCIATION R ULES AND D ATA M INING A LGORITHM  Association Rules Mining is a Dat a Mining algorithm. It is well studied and most widely used in a variety of Data Mining methods in recent years. Data Mining means to analysis the observed data sets and extract th e knowledge and rules that is implicit, unknown and has poten tial value for decision-making from the large database. The main Data Mining algorithms include: Rough Set Association Rule, Classification Clustering, Genetic Algorithms Neural Net works A Concept of Association Rules In Data Mining knowledge pattern, Association Rules is important. The concept of Association Rules given  by Agrawal in 1993 is a simple ru le for data application and an interdependence relationship among the data objects Assume I = \(i1, i2, ..., im\of some attributes known as Itemset, ik \(1 \002 k \002 n\m usually used to record the value of some attribute of a database. The number of the set I is known as the length of the itemset and an itemset whose length is n is known as n-items et. An Association Rules is an implication as following A 002 B. If A, B 003 I, and A 004 B 002 005  the rule A B is tenable in the transaction set D. Two parameters as following used to describe the properties of Association Rules 002 1. Confidence 003\003 If C% of transaction set D which includes A and contains B at the same time, then C% is the Confidence of the Association rules A B. In short, Confidence means that how much probability sets B will occur in the transaction Itemset A at the same time, and it is a measurement of the accuracy of Association Rules 002 2. Support 003\003 If S% of transaction set D includes Itemset A and B at one time, then S% is the Support of the association rules A B. Support shows the degree of representation of this rule in all transaction. It is obviously that the greater the Support is, the more important and the more widely application the Association Rules is. Suppor t is a measurement of the importance of Association Rules 002 If Support and C onfidence of Associati on Rules are not in consideration, many association rules can be found in database In fact, people are only interested in some association rules that meet a certain degree of Support and Confidence. Therefore, in order to find meaningful asso ciation rules, two thresholds need to be offered, which are Mi nSupp and MinConf. Generally speaking, one rule meeting certain requirements \(such as

greater Support and Confidence level Association Rules Mining means to generate all the association rules that meet MinSupp and MinConf from a given transaction set D To dig out the association rules contains two following major steps 1. To discover all the frequent itemsets. The frequency of these itemsets should be at least equal to \(pre-set 2. To generate Strong rules from the frequent itemsets These rules must meet the th resholds of MinSupp and MinConf B to Generate Association Rules The relevant association rules can be easily acquire after digging out all the frequent itemsets from database D, which is to obtain the Strong rules that meet MinSu pp and MinConf The following formula can be us ed to obtain th e Confidence of the association rules received. The conditional probability here is calculated by using the su pport frequency of the itemsets confidence \(A B 002   _ sup   _ sup A count port B A count port 006  Among which , support_ount \(A 006 B\ transaction record number of the items including set A 006 B  support_ount \(A record number of the items including set A. Based on th e formula above, the operations to generate association rules are as follows 1. for each frequent set l, to generate all the nonempty subset of it 2. For each nonempty subset s, if  conf s count port l count port min_   _ sup   _ sup 007  Then the association rule s 004 l-s 005 is produced 006 min_conf is the threshold of MinConf. As the association rule is generated directly through freque nt itemsets, therefore all the items covered by the association rules meet the threshold of the MinSupp 002 III A PPLICATION OF A SSOCIATION R ULES M INING IN THE S YSTEM OF T EACHING A PPRAISAL  A to Prepare the Data To take 200 teaching quality assessment tables of the teachers in this school randomly and input four data that are teachersê number, age, title and assessment scores into the database, ignoring other information, then we will find out the relationship among the age, the title and the assessment scores through Data Mining. Table 001\011 gives a view of part teaching assessment information including 200 records   TABLE I V IEW OF T EACHING A SSESSMENT I NFORMATION  number of teachers age title assessment score 19123 45 professor 95 19141 39 associate professor 92 19145 31 lecturer 91 19150 37 associate professor 89 19156 53 professor 93 19160 25 assistant lecturer 79 19161 29 lecturer 87    The age attribute in table 1 is numerical and it should been converted to Boolean ty pe. In order to discrete, the age is divided into 4 groups named: A1 [22 A 2  31 3 5   A3  36     di vided into: B1 assistant lecturer B2 lecturer, B3 associate professor, B4 professor. According to the actual situation, the title and the assessment scores are divided into: C1 [901 C2 80 89 C3 7 0, 7 9  C4 [0 69  A part of the data converted is shown in table II TABLE II P ART OF THE D ATA C ONVERTED  number A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 B 1 B 2 B 3 B 4 C 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 19123 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 19141 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 19145 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 19150 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 19156 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 19160 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 19161 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 B Association Rules Mining Now we analysis the relationship between the classroom teaching effectiveness and the teachersê age and title. If the assessment score 010 90 that m eans a good classroom teaching effectiveness. The characteristics of the teachers who have a good classroom teaching effectiveness will be dig out by using association rules al gorithm and mining technology First, almost 80 records whose assessment scores more than 90 can be received by searching the original database. Then assuming minsup = 5%, minconf = 16%, after mining, the initial association rules may be obtained, as shown in Table III The rule A shows that the possibility of excellent rate is 25.37% and the Support is 6% for those teachers whose age is between 31 Ö 35. Similarly, the rule F shows that the possibility of excellent rate is 22.75 and the Support is 6 for those professors

The quality of teachers classroom teaching is great related to their titles and performance level. Therefore, teachers must strive to improve their performance level and titles to enhance their teaching quality. If high-titled and well-educated teachers give more lessons, the quality of classroom teaching would be much better as a whole 1. In the teachers team, the backbone group whose age is in 50 - 60 is still a large proportion, and these teachers are now about to retire or already retired. The vacancy they left is must to fill in immediately. Therefor e, it is important to train the young teachers under the age of 30 2. The 31 - 49-year-old middle-aged teachers with rich teaching experience can usually gain higher Support and Confidence. This shows the im portance to build a reasonable teacher team and to improve the practical teaching ability of the middle-aged teachers. When the middle-aged teachers have grown up to become the backbone, the structure of the teaching team will be more reasonable 3. The university teaching content is characterized as being highly professional, stron g scientific, informative, broad and deep, and the classroom teaching is strong academic. The mediate-titled teachers who have a high ability of research and a wide range of knowledge can often encourage students to study hard and have the ability to combine teaching with research. The primary-titled teachers need more practice, more study and harder work to im prove their level of research and teaching In this way, if the teachers who have different ages and titles can been arranged reasona bly, students will  maintain a good state of learning. The same by providing information to support decision-making, the teaching quality can be improved IV C ONCLUSION  A large amount of data has accumulated during the investigation of teaching appraisal that must be engaged each semester in many universities. It is obviously a waste if the data are only used as a basis of teachersê promoted and excellent commentary and so on. We should make full use of data mining technology to find out the hidden law or model and dig out some useful knowled ge for further education services. It is an important way to check the effectiveness and improve the teaching quality to find out the relationship from a large amount of data. This thesis discusses how to use association rules in data mining t echnology in order to ensure a scientific teaching appraisal. As the direct impact on the teaching quality of teaching appraisal, it has drawn  more and more attention.

4 Completeness theorems In this section we introduce an axiomatic system for our logic and prove completeness theorems First we introduce deduction rules and a notion of a proof from a set T of FAIs Second we prove that A  B is provable from a set T of FAIs iff A  B semantically follows from T in degree 1 ordinary completeness Third we introduce a concept of a degree j A  B j  T of provability of A  B from a fuzzy set T of FAIs and show that j A  B j  T  jj A  B jj  T graded completeness 4.1 Deduction rules Our axiomatic system consists of the following deduction rules  Ax infer A  A  B  DCut from A  B and B  C  D infer A  C  D  Sh from A  B infer c 003  A  c 003  B for each A B C D 2 L Y  and c 2 L  Rules Sh are to be understood as usual deduction rules having FAIs which are of the form of FAIs in the input part the part preceding infer of a rule a rule allows us to infer in one step the corresponding FAI in the output part the part following infer of a rule Ax is a nullary rule axiom which says that each A  A  B  A B 2 L Y  is inferred in one step Rules Sh resemble Armstrong rules from database theory Remark 1 If 003 is globalization Sh can be omitted Indeed for c  1  we have c 003  1 and Sh becomes from A  B infer A  B  which is a trivial rule for c  1  we have c 003  0 and Sh becomes from A  B infer Y  Y  which can be omitted since Y  Y can be inferred by Ax A  B is called provable from a set T of FAIs using a set R of deduction rules written T  R A  B  if there is a sequence  1       n of fuzzy attribute implications such that  n is A  B and for each  i we either have  i 2 T or  i is inferred in one step from some of the preceding formulas i.e  1       i 000 1  using some deduction rule from R  If R consists of Sh we say just provable     instead of provable    using R  and write just T  A  B instead of T  R A  B  A deduction rule from  1       n infer     i   are fuzzy attribute implications is said to be derivable from a set R of deduction rules if f  1       n g  R   Again if R consists of Sh we omit R  We omit the proof of the next lemma Lemma 16 The following deduction rules are derivable from Ax and DCut Ref infer A  A  Wea from A  B infer A  C  B  Add from A  B and A  C infer A  B  C  Pro from A  B  C infer A  B  Tra from A  B and B  C infer A  C  for each A B C D 2 L Y  4.2 Ordinary completeness In this section we show that deduction rules Sh are sound and we prove their completeness A deduction rule from  1       n infer   is said to be sound if for each M 2 Mod f  1       n g  we have M 2 Mod f  g   i.e each model of all of  1       n is also a model of   The following lemmas are needed to prove our completeness theorems The proofs are technically involved and we omit them due to lack of space Lemma 17 Each of the deduction rules Sh is sound A set T of FAIs is called semantically closed if jj A  B jj  T  1 iff A  B 2 T  i.e if T  f A  B j jj A  B jj  T  1 g  syntactically closed if T  A  B iff A  B 2 T  i.e if T  f A  B j T  A  B g  The following lemma is almost immediate Lemma 18 A set T of fuzzy attribute implications is syntactically closed iff we have Ax A  A  B 2 T  DCut if A  B 2 T and B  C  D 2 T then A  C  D 2 T  Sh if A  B 2 T then c 003  A  c 003  B 2 T for each A B C D 2 L Y  and c 2 L  Lemma 19 Let T be a set of fuzzy attribute implications If T is semantically closed then T is syntactically closed Lemma 20 Let T be a set of fuzzy attribute implications let both Y and L be 002nite If T is syntactically closed then T is semantically closed Corollary 21 If L and Y are 002nite a set T of FAI T is syntactically closed iff T is semantically closed Theorem 22 ordinary completeness Let L and Y be 002nite Let T be a set of fuzzy attribute implications Then T  A  B iff jj A  B jj  T  1

Proof Sketch Denote by syn  T  the least syntactically closed set of fuzzy attribute implications which contains T  It can be shown that syn  T   f A  B j T  A  B g  Furthermore denote by sem  T  the least semantically closed set of fuzzy attribute implications which contains T  It can be shown that sem  T   f A  B j jj A  B jj  T  1 g  To prove the claim we need to show syn  T   sem  T   As syn  T  is syntactically closed it is also semantically closed by Corollary 21 which means sem  syn  T  022 syn  T   Therefore by T 022 syn  T  we get sem  T  022 sem  syn  T  022 syn  T   In a similar manner we get syn  T  022 sem  T   showing syn  T   sem  T   The proof is complete 003 4.3 Graded completeness We now turn to a graded version of the completeness theorem Note that Theorem 22 can be read as providing a syntactic characterization of entailment in degree 1  i.e of jj A  B jj  T  1  However entailment comes in degrees in general jj A  B jj  T is a degree not necessarily equal to 0 or 1  Our aim is to capture jj A  B jj  T syntactically For this purpose we introduce a notion of a degree j A  B j  T of provability of A  B from a fuzzy set T of FAIs Then we show that j A  B j  T  jj A  B jj  T  which can be understood as a graded completeness completeness in degrees Note that graded completeness was introduced by Pavelka see e.g 7 for detailed information For a fuzzy set T of FAIs and for A  B we de\002ne a degree j A  B j  T 2 L to which A  B is provable from T by j A  B j T  W f c 2 L j c T   A  c 012 B g  17 where c T  is de\002ned as in Lemma 5 This makes use of the reduction of general entailment from fuzzy sets of FAIs to entailment in degree 1 from crisp sets of FAIs established in Corollary 7 The we get Theorem 23 graded completeness Let L and Y be 002nite Then for every fuzzy set T of fuzzy attribute implications and A  B we have j A  B j  T  jj A  B jj  T  5 Further issues We provided several results regarding a logic of attribute containment for graded attributes Main results established in the paper are a description of non-redundant bases of data tables with fuzzy attributes and completeness theorems for such logic We omitted several issues which we plan to include in the full version Most importantly model-theoretic results related to an ef\002cient checking of entailment computation of non-redundant bases and illustrative as well as real-world examples References  S Abiteboul et al  The Lowell database research self-assessment Communications of ACM  48 pp 111ñ118 2005  R Belohla v ek Fuzzy Relational Systems Foundations and Principles  New York Kluwer 2002  R Belohla v ek V  Vychodil Fuzzy attrib ute implications computing non-redundant bases using maximal independent sets in AI 2005 Arti\002cial Intelligence  S Zhang and R Jarvis Eds LNAI  3809 Berlin Springer-Verlag pp 1126ñ1129 2005  R Belohla v ek V  Vychodil  Attrib ute implications in a fuzzy setting in ICFCA 2006 International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis  R Missaoui and J Schmid Eds LNAI  3874 Berlin Springer-Verlag pp 45ñ60 2006  B Ganter  R W ille Formal Concept Analysis Mathematical Foundations  Berlin Springer 1999  G Geor gescu A Popescu Non-dual fuzzy connections Archive for Mathematical Logic  43 pp 1009 1039 2004  G Gerla Fuzzy Logic Mathematical Tools for Approximate Reasoning  Dordrecht Kluwer 2001  J A Goguen The logic of ine xact concepts Synthese  18 pp 325ñ373 1968  J.-L Guigues V  Duquenne F amilles minimales d'implications informatives resultant d'un tableau de donn  ees binaires Math Sci Humaines  95 pp 5ñ18 1986  P  H  ajek Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic  Dordrecht Kluwer 1998  P  H  ajek T Havr  anek Mechanizing Hypotheses Formation Mathematical Foundations for a General Theory  Berlin Springer 1978  D Maier  The Theory of Relational Databases  Rockville Computer Science Press 1983  J Rauch Logic of association rules Applied Intelligence  22 pp 9ñ28 2005  C Zhang C S Zhang Association Rule Mining Models and Algorithms  Berlin Springer-Verlag 2002

Time Complexity and Speed We now evaluate scalability and speed with large high dimensional data sets to only compute the models as shown in Figure 7 The plotted times include the time to store models on disk but exclude the time to mine frequent itemsets We experimentally prove 1 Time complexity to compute models is linear on data set size 2 Sparse vector and matrix computations yield efﬁcient algorithms whose accuracy was studied before 3 Dimensionality has minimal impact on speed assuming average transaction size T is small Transactions are clu stered with Incremental Kmeans 26 introduced on Sectio n 3 Large transaction les were created with the IBM synthetic data generator 3 ha ving defaults n 1 M T=10 I=4 Figure 7 shows time complexity to compute the clustering model The rst plot on the left shows time growth to build the clustering with a data set with one million records T10I4D1M As can be seen times grow linearly as n increases highlighting the algorithms efﬁciency On the other hand notice d has marginal impact on time when it is increased 10-fold on both models due to optimized sparse matrix computations The second plot on the right in Figure 7 shows time complexity to compute clustering models increasing k on T10I4D100k Remember k is the main parameter to control support estimation accuracy In a similar manner to the previous experiments times are plotted for two high dimensionalities d  100 and d 1  000 As can be seen time complexity is linear on k  whereas time is practically independent from d  Therefore our methods are competitive both on accuracy and time performance 4.5 Summary The clustering model provides several advantages It is a descriptive model of the data set It enables support estimation and it can be processed in main memory It requires the user to specify the number of clusters as main input parameter but it does not require support thresholds More importantly clusters can help discovering long itemsets appearing at very low support levels We now discuss accuracy In general the number of clusters is the most important model characteristic to improve accuracy A higher number of clusters generally produces tighter bounds and therefore more accurate support estimations The clustering model quality has a direct relationship to support estimation error We introduced a parameter to improve accuracy wh en mining frequent itemsets from the model this parameter eliminate spurious itemsets unlikely to be frequent The clustering model is reasonably accurate on a wide spectrum of support values but accuracy decreases as support decreases We conclude with a summary on time complexity and efﬁciency When the clustering model is available it is a signiﬁcantly faster mechanis m than the A-priori algorithm to search for frequent itemsets Decreasing support impacts performance due to the rapid co mbinatorial growth on the number of itemsets In general the clustering model is much smaller than a large data set O  dk  O  dn  A clustering model can be computed in linear time with respect to data set size In typical transaction data sets dimensionality has marginal impact on time 5 Related Work There is a lot of

for data streams with the support of recent and old itemsets this approach relies on discrete algorithms for efﬁcient frequency computation instead of using machine learning models like our proposal

constrained frequent itemset search are NP-hard and they are at least P-hard meaning t hey will remain intractable even if P=NP This work gives evidence it is not a good idea to mine all frequent itemsets above a support threshold since the output size is combinatorial In 13 t h e a ut hors d eri v e a bound on the number of candidate itemsets given the current set of frequent itemsets when using a level-wise algorithm Covers and bases 37 21 a re an alternati v e t o s ummarize association rules using a comb inatorial approach instead of a model Clusters have some resemblance to bases in the sense that each cluster can be used to derive all subsets from a maximal itemset The model represents an approximate cover for all potential associations We now discuss closely related work on establishing relationships between association rules and other data mining techniques Preliminary results on using clusters to get lower and upper bounds for support is given in 27  I n g eneral there is a tradeoff between rules with high support and rules with high conﬁdence 33 t h i s w o rk propos es an al gorithm that mines the best rules under a Bayesian model There has been work on clustering transactions from itemsets 41  H o w e v er  t hi s a pproach goes i n t he oppos i t e di rection it rst mines associations and from them tries to get clusters Clustering association rules rather than transactions once they are mined is analyzed in 22  T he out put is a summary of association rules The approach is different from ours since this proposal works with the original data set whereas ours produces a model of the data set In 42 the idea of mining frequent itemsets with error tolerance is introduced This approach is related to ours since the error is somewhat similar to the bounds we propose Their algorithm can be used as a means to cluster transactions or perform estimation of query selectivity In 39 t he aut hors explore the idea of building approximate models for associations to see how they change over time 6 Conclusions This article proposed to use clusters on binary data sets to bound and estimate association rule support and conﬁdence The sufﬁcient statistics for clustering binary data are simpler than those required for numeric data sets and consist only of the sum of binary points transactions Each cluster represents a long itemset from which shorter itemsets can be easily derived The clustering model on high dimensional binary data sets is computed with efﬁcient operations on sparse matrices skipping zeroes We rst presented lower and upper bounds on support whose average estimates actual support Model-based support metrics obey the well-known downward closure property Experiments measured accuracy focusing on relative error in support estimations and efﬁciency with real and synthetic data sets A clustering model is accurate to estimate support when using a sufﬁciently high number of clusters When the number of clusters increases accuracy increases On the other hand as the minimum support threshold decreases accuracy also decreases but at a different rate depending on the data set The error on support estimation slowly increases as itemset length increases The model is fairly accurate to discover a large set of frequent itemsets at multiple support levels Clustering is faster than A-priori to mine frequent itemsets without considering the time to compute the model Adding the time to compute the model clustering is slower than Apriori at high support levels but faster at low support levels The clustering model can be built in linear time on data size Sparse matrix operations enable fast computation with high dimensional transaction data sets There exist important research issues We want to analytically understand the relationship between the clustering model and the error on support estimation We need to determine an optimal number of clusters given a maximum error level Correlation analysis and PCA represent a next step after the clustering model but the challenges are updating much larger matrices and dealing with numerical issues We plan to incorporate constraints based on domain knowledge into the search process Our algorithm can be optimized to discover and periodically refresh a set of association rules on streaming data sets References 1 C  A ggar w al and P  Y u F
