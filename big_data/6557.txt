INTRODUCTION \nThe NASA Science Mission Directorate \(SMD Business Innovative Research \(SBIR  spread out over 11 federal departments including \nthe Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce nDepartment of Defense, Department of Education, \nDepartment of Energy, Department of Health and Human nServices, Department of Transportation, Environmental \nProtection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space nAdministration, National Science Foundation, and Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission [2].  The NASA SBIR budget for \nFY 2012 was about $138 million with about 40% of it in the \nSMD [3].  One of the challenges of administrating this \nprogram is to balance the need to foster innovation in small \nbusinesses and the need to demonstrate commercialization \nby infusion into NASA or by developing a commercial \nproduct outside of NASA Because of the often-risky nature \nof innovation, SBIR programs will tend to drift into a status \nthat rewards proposals that promise to deliver a product that \nis exactly what was specified in the call.  These proposals ntend to be more engineering and product modification in \nnature.  This practice often satisfies the metric of providing \na clear demonstration of infusion and thus also providing a \npublishable success story.  However another goal of the \nSBIR program is to foster innovation as a national asset.  \nThis is accomplished through innovation by small and agile \ncompanies, and then these innovative ideas are infused into \nlarge, risk-averse and conservative engineering \norganizations like NASA.  This goal requires a directive to \ninvest \(risk portion of funding on proposals that \naddress technical challenges with more innovative \napproaches that have uncertain but potentially more \nrewarding outcomes.   \nEstablishing the balance between innovation and ncommercialization is made difficult by factors such as risk \naversion and the opportunity to address a specific \nrequirement specified in the call for proposals in the NASA \nSBIR program solicitation.  Even characterizing innovation \nfrom commercialization is challenging because there is a \nreward metric for successful infusion and \ncommercialization, but none for successful innovation.  In \ngeneral, the ultimate infusion and commercialization of \ninnovative solutions has a lower probability than \n  2 \nimplementation of established ideas, but they can also have \na much higher return on investment.  If innovative ideas are nvalued and solicited in the SBIR program, then NASA \ntechnology requirements need to be specified in a way 


that \ndefines the problem and possible solution, but will also \nallow for different approaches and unconventional methods.  \nIt may also be necessary to establish a guideline to risk a \npercentage of awards on these innovations.  The size of this \npercentage is dependent on many cultural factors as well as \nthe perceived risk to reward ratio of innovation versus the \nreturn on investment for more conservative solutions nAdditional challenges come from the complexity of having \na broad community of SBIR customers that include the \nNASA Centers, the NASA Directorates and projects, the \nNASA Office of the Chief Technologist and most nimportantly the nation’s small businesses.  Since all of these \nstakeholders do not share the same vision or technical need, \nthey also add to the need for balancing the program.  This \npaper addresses the need for innovation within NASA’s \nSMD, the challenges faced, and how to solicit it within the \nframework of the SBIR program. \n \n2. BACKGROUND \nCurrently, solicitation and selection of NASA Science \nMission Directorate SBIR proposals are based on science \ntraceability to the nationally set goals outlined in various \ndecadal surveys and reports [4-8].  The SMD SBIR \nProgram’s emphasis on science traceability is a unique \nfeature of this segment of the program and sets it apart from \nother SBIR programs.  However, over the history of the nprogram, the balance between soliciting general ideas versus \nvery specific implementations has changed This has had an \naffect on the level of innovation and commercialization of \nthe proposals.  \nHistorical Framework for the SMD SBIR Program \nOver the history of the NASA SBIR Program, changes in \nNASA’s organizational structure and the location of the \nSBIR Program in that structure has resulted in pressures to nmodify the direction followed by the program.  From its \nearliest years \(1983 moved toward \nmore general solicitations that would allow for more \ninnovative proposals.  This was followed by a trend \(in the \n1990s in utilizing the SBIR \nProgram for some of its new technology requirements.  \nMore recently, the SBIR Program was moved from the \nIntellectual Property Program with an emphasis on \ncommercialization to the Office of the Chief Technologist \nwhere the emphasis shifted toward innovative technology \ninfusion.  Using the Program’s success story history, an \nattempt will be made to shed some light on the merits of \nemphasizing basic research or more innovative proposals at \nthe expense of more commercially oriented projects that \nbegin with more mature technologies. \nOther SBIR Programs \nIn reporting performance of SBIR programs on a national nlevel, a broad measure of productivity including agency \napplication, commercial sales including other federal \nagencies and the private sector, and funding for continued \nresearch and development is used for the metric.  These are \neasy to measure and demonstrate and can be tied to tangible \nresults.  SBIR programs in the Department of Defense \nusually report higher levels of commercialization that other \nagencies, with the Navy having the highest results.  \nCongress often emphasizes the commercialization aspect of \nthe SBIR program as the measure of success for small \nbusinesses.  Although they also emphasize innovation and \ncreativity these properties not measured directly.  The \nquestion remains whether strong emphasis on \ncommercialization is a good direction for SMD to pursue or \ndoes commercialization come at the expense of innovation? \n \n3. SBIR PROGRAM STAKEHOLDERS  \nThe nature of the SBIR Program in one of having multiple \nlevels of stakeholders that have very different program \nrequirements and often divergent definitions of success.  A \nbroad community of SBIR customers that include the \nNASA Centers, the NASA Directorates and projects, the \nNASA Office of the Chief Technologist and, most \nimportantly, the nation’s small businesses creates a \ncomplexity that is a particular challenge when developing \nperformance metrics and defining value. \nTopic and Subtopic Managers \nAt the forefront of defining a task to be solicited in the \nSBIR program are the Topic and Subtopic managers These \nindividuals are responsible for developing potential task \ndescriptions for the program solicitation by using input from \nprograms and projects from their local centers.  They also \ndemonstrate science traceability of these tasks as found in a \nvariety of science program committee reports and surveys \n[4-8].  In addition they are also responsible for providing \nindependent technical reviews of proposals and for \nadvocating their subtopic’s selected proposals to their \ncenters for ranking.  Success criteria at this level is the nintroduction of a subtopic that provides infusible \ntechnologies or products into a project that can be naccomplished by a small business within the time and \nbudgets available. \nNASA Centers \nThe nine NASA centers and JPL have different program \nresponsibilities and will have different desires for their \nparticipation in the SBIR program.  Each center has \nownership of proposals within their developed subtopics \nunless they have transferred control to another participating \ncenter.  For SMD, each center ranks their proposals and \nsubmits an ordered list to the SMD SBIR Office.  Center \nranking will reflect priorities for their local programs and nfor future center competitiveness. \n  3 \nOffice of the Chief Technologist \nThe NASA SBIR program is administered under the Office \nof the Chief Technologist \(OCT NASA technology priorities.  Each center \nhas a Center Chief Technologist \(CCT 


The SMD requires that CCTs are directly \ninvolved in the center ranking and are the concurring \nofficials for the center.  Thus center ranking will reflect the \noverall NASA technology program. \nSMD Divisions \nAfter all of the individual center ranking are collected they \nare assembled into one list by the SMD SBIR Official and ncommittee representatives from the four SMD Divisions \n\(Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics and Planetary \nScience Division input will \ntry to balance the overall SMD SBIR selections to the \nrelative size and program needs of the divisions within \nSMD.   \nSMD and NASA \nEventually, SMD rankings are interleaved with the other \nNASA Directorates \(Human Exploration and Operations \nMission Directorate and Aeronautics Mission Directorate nSpace Operations Mission Directorate  technologies into \nflight projects or the enabling of new areas leading to future \nproject implementations nSmall Business Community \nThe most important SBIR customer is the small business \ncommunity.  The SBIR Program is open to all small \nbusinesses with less than 500 employees.  The majority of \nproposing companies have less than 5 employees.  This \ncommunity can be far more agile and open to risk taking \nand innovation than the generally risk averse and \nconservative NASA and its larger prime contractors.  This \noffers a pathway for introduction of innovation into NASA \nand can enable new directions and missions in relatively nshort development times.  Metrics for success at the small \nbusiness level can range from survival as a business from \none year to the next to major market penetration of a new \ntechnology, product or service.  In general, the inflow of \neconomic value to a company is measurable and a good \nindicator of success.  The acquisition of new research and \ndevelopment funds by a small business can be almost as \nimportant as commercial sales.  However, from a NASA \npoint of view infusion into a project would be more valuable \nto NASA than having to provide additional funding for \ndevelopment of a promising effort.   \nThe Nation \nAt the national level we benefit from nurturing a community \nof innovative small businesses that can respond to global \nopportunities.  In terms of global influence, innovation is \nprobably one of our strongest defining traits and is \nconsidered a national asset.  A measure of SBIR success at a \nnational level is both the survival and nurturing of small \nbusiness and the maintenance of a robust community of \ninnovators. \n \n4 COMMERCIALIZATION METRICS  \nIn order to ascertain the performance of the SBIR program \nmetrics are required to measure the value created through \nproduct and service utilization by NASA, other Federal \nagencies and customers in the private sector.  NASA \nutilization or infusion is often a unique implementation with \nlimited application beyond the NASA mission or program.  \nThe second area of infusion is the private sector and other ngovernment agencies where the company develops a market \nfor their product or service beyond NASA.  Finally there is \nadditional funding received by the small business for further \ntechnology research and development This attempts to \nmeasure the technology achieved in the SBIR project.  The \nvalue to the program stakeholders in each of these areas is \ntreated somewhat differently and will be discussed below. \nThe Success Story  \nNASA has participated in the SBIR program since its \ninception in 1983.  Performance of the program since its nbeginning has been measured by the concept of the Success \nStory.  From an economic perspective, this success story \nmetric focuses on an extended concept of commercialization \nincluding NASA applications, sales in the private sector and \nto other government agencies, and additional resources \ninvested in development of the technology.  Through May \n1, 2012, approximately 635 NASA SBIR success stories \nhave been submitted by the nine NASA centers and JPL and \nposted to the NASA SBIR Program web page [3].   \n \nBecause there is no requirement for companies to report \nsuccess stories and no standard format for the information, \nthe completeness of the data set is limited by the amount of \neffort put into investigating each task by the participating \nNASA centers.  Additionally, because it often takes years \nbeyond the initial 1 to 3 year SBIR investment to \ncommercialize and infuse a product or service, a long period \ncan exist between SBIR completion and reporting of a \nsuccess story.  Because of this latency the early reporting of \na success story may not capture the full value of the infusion \nor commercialization. \n \nIn order to use the collected success story data we \ndeveloped two additional metrics to characterize the level of \ntechnology innovation of the original project, and to assess \nthe value of the technology developed \(to the company and \nto NASA difficult factor to measure, but \nan attempt was made to gauge the level of maturity of the \ntechnology being developed at the beginning of the task.   \n \nThe value of success stories as an SBIR Program metric is nlimited by the fact that no standard has existed as to what \n  4 \nconstitutes a success story.  Similarly, no scale has been \nused to rank the significance of reported success stories.  To \ncorrect for this problem, all of the success stories have been \nrated on a scale from no significant commercial or NASA \napplication to participation in a major NASA flight mission.   \nThis process has a number of shortcomings resulting from a nlack of resources to fully investigate each story; however, \nthe numbers are large enough that the errors 


will tend to \naverage out.  \n \nTechnology Innovation Level Metric \nA technology innovation metric was developed to assess the \nlevel of innovation for each success story. This metric \naddresses technology innovation levels that range from \nengineering application of existing technology to \nfundamental or basic research.   The lower numbers on the \nscale refer to applications with high technical maturity and \nlimited technology risk.  They are characterized by very \nspecific applications, using existing technology and start out \nwith higher technology readiness levels \(TRL  beginning TRLs \nand requiring some degree of research and development. \n \nRecent years have seen some emphasis on higher innovation \nlevels \(lower TRLs development.  This raises a question, is \nthe SBIR program a good platform for high innovation \nprojects This metric should shed some light on this \nquestion. \n \nThe scale used in categorizing the technical innovation level \nof the original project for each success story is described in \nTable 1.  An example of category 1 would be the \nenhancement of an existing commercial product by adding \nadditional features, using available technology.  At the other \nend of the scale, category 5, an example would be a project \nfor a fuel cell or deformable mirror technology research and \ndevelopment task.  Generally, these highest innovation nlevels are applications of new technology to address \nproblems in non-traditional ways and not necessarily basic \nresearch.  In term of the solicitation, higher innovation tasks \nare ones addressing proposal calls for concepts or new idea \ninvestigations rather than calls for specified products. \n \nTable 1.  Categories of Technology Innovation Level \n \nCategory Description \n1 Application of existing technology to a new \nsituation engineering development \n2 Modify an existing product to take advantage of \nnew developments or new opportunities \n3 Significant revision of existing technology to \nincrease its realm of application \n4 Exploring the application potential of a new \ntechnology \n5 Basic research, investigating the merits of a new ntechnology concept \n \nValuation of Success Stories \nIn order to access the economic value of each success story \nfor program stakeholders a value metric based on three \nmeasurable \(or observable employed.  First is \nthe additional research and development funding attracted \nfor further technology research and development.  This is \njust the dollar amount of additional investments through \nsuccessful proposals or grants.  The second factor is a \nstraight measure of the commercial sales of the developed ntechnology, product or service.  For the purposes of this \nvalue metric we assume that additional research and \ndevelopment funds are of moderately less value to a \nprogram stakeholders \(emphasizing small businesses than \ncommercial sales.  The third valuation factor is more \ndifficult to quantify, however.  This last factor is the \ninfusion and use of the technology by NASA programs.  \nHere the range is from hardware or software used in a \nNASA program development or flown on a NASA mission \nwith either limited or significant commercial value.  \nIntegrating these factors into a scale is problematic and \nsubjective, however Table 2 describes the factors used for \nattributing a measure of value to each success story. \nTable 2.  Rank Ordered List of Value Levels of SBIR \nProject Outcomes \n \nValue  Description \n1 No significant commercial sales \(greater than n$50,000 commercial sales or a limited NASA \napplication \n4 Additional research and development funding of \n$1,000,000 n     5 $1 million in commercial sales \n     6 Commercial sales of $5 million or $1 million \nannually \n7 Hardware or software used in NASA Program \ndevelopment work \n8 Flown on NASA mission but limited commercial nvalue \n     9 Commercial sales in excess of $10 million \n    10 Flown on NASA mission, significant commercial nvalue \n \n \n5. ANALYSIS OF SUCCESS STORIES \nOne reason for taking a closer look at the historical success nstory database is the trend in the number of success stories \nsince the program started.   This trend is shown in Figure 1 \nbeginning with the program’s first year, 1983, through \n2006.  The economically significant trend line excludes \nsuccess stories that reported less than total sales of $50,000 \nand no NASA application or significant amounts of \nadditional R&D funding \(Value Levels from Table 2 of 2 or \ngreater exclusion of these low value success stories \nhighlights a trend in the 1990s to encourage reporting of \n  5 nsuccess stories with only potential or very limited \ncommercialization.   \n \nFrom this chart it is clear that the number of success stories \npeaked between 1990 and 1996 and experienced a \nsignificant decline since then In the most recent couple of \nyears, some of the decline may be attributed to the long time \nit takes for some success stories to come to light.  Also, \nsome under-reporting may have occurred as a result of \nprogram restructuring, changes in emphasis of reporting \nsuccess stories and available resources to investigate them nAt least some of the decline is most likely the result of a \nreduction of successful NASA SBIR projects.   \n n \n \nFigure 1 – Number of Total and Economically \nSignificant Only Success Stories by SBIR Program Year.  \nThe large total peak in the 1990s was due to a program \nemphasis on reporting success stories.  Economically nsignificant success stories required Value Levels of 2 or \ngreater. \nOne possible explanation for the decline 


since 1996 is a \nchange in the selection process that favors projects with the \npotential for higher value outcomes for NASA as opposed \nto selecting proposals on the basis of their technical merit.  \nThe scale used for measuring economic value places some \nemphasis on NASA application.  In order to remove the \neffect of the total number of success stories per year, the \naverage economic value of the success stories for each year nare plotted in Figure 2. \n \n \nFigure 2 – Success Story Average Economic Value Level \nby Year \(all success stories the low levels \nwhich were seen in the previous two years.  That is, the \nrecovery has only brought the average success story value \nback to the levels seen prior to 2001. In addition, no \nadjustment has been made for inflation that results in some \nupward bias to this trend line.  The lack of any increase in \neconomic value in the most recent years is even more \nevident if all success stories without significant economic nvalue are excluded from the calculations as seen in Figure 3. \nOnce again, no adjustment has been made for inflation.    If \nthere was a shift in the selection process to proposals having \nhigher potential economic value, it is not evident in the \nreported success stories.  \n \n \nFigure 3 – Success Story Average Economic Value Level \nby Year \(excluding stories with no significant economic \nvalue, i.e. Value Levels of 2 or greater area of \nfundamental or basic research.   This policy is in line with \nthe relocation of the SBIR Program to the Chief \nTechnologist’s Office.  The history of the NASA SBIR \nProgram can shed some light on what can be expected from \nthis shift in selection policy.  Table 3 shows the number of \nsuccess stories that resulted from projects in each of the five \ntechnical innovation levels defined in Table 1 from basic \nengineering projects or level 1 to level 5 for basic research.   \nOut the 635 success stories, 87 or 13.7 % were the result of \nprojects categorized as basic research over the years from \n1983 to 2006.  The NASA SBIR Program has funded a \nsignificant number of projects that can be classified as \nfalling in the area of basic research nTable 3.  Number of Successful Projects in Each \nTechnology Innovation Level \(1983 through 2006 nTechnology Innovation             Number of Successful \nLevel    SBIR Projects   \n1    46 \n2    179 \n3    261 n4    62 \n5     87 \n \nThe question then is: what is the economic value of these \nsuccess stories compared to projects belonging to the other \nfour technology innovation level categories?  Figure 4 \nshows the average economic contribution of SBIR projects \n0 10 \n20 30 \n40 50 \n60 \n83  85  87  89  91  93  95  97  99  01  03 05 \nTotal \nEconomically Signi?cant \n \n0 1 2 \n3 4 5 \n6 7 \n83  85  87  89  91  93  95  97  99  01  03 05 \n0 1 2 \n3 4 5 \n6 7 \n83  85  87  89  91  93  95  97  99  01  03  05 \n  6 \nin each of the 5 technology level categories for the period \nfrom 1983 through 2006.  It’s quite apparent that the \neconomic value of the success stories in the category 5 or \nhigh innovation category had a lower economic return.  The \nlower bars red value and thus reflect a more commercial-oriented \nview of value \(i.e. less business oriented and more NASA noriented Y-Axis Innovation Level \n\(X-Axis determination \nof economic value. \nAt face value these findings have two important \nimplications.  The first is that the NASA SBIR Program \ncould improve its economic return by limiting its funding of \nhigher innovation research proposals.  There are of course \nlimitations since there is a fixed pool each year from which \nto select proposals.  There will necessarily be some \nreduction in the quality of proposals funded if the number of \nhigh innovation proposals funded is reduced.  The second \nimplication is that it may be desirable to increase the \nnumber of proposals received or to avoid any limitations \nsuch as reducing the number subtopics that would limit the \nnumber of proposals received.  The trade-off here is the \nincrease in evaluations needed and proposal handling that \ngoes with a larger number of proposals received.  \nNevertheless, in light of the significant drop in success \nstories since the 1996 Program year, a focus on attracting \nmore and better proposals may be warranted. \nThose favoring highly innovative proposals often base their \nargument on the claim that that they offer a higher return for \nthe additional risk.  Have the higher innovation level nproposals funded so far by the program yielded a greater \npayoff than the proposals funded in the other categories?  Of \nthe 87 success stories based on projects at the highest \ninnovation levels, 36 reported anything of significant \neconomic value. Focusing on success stories with \nsignificant economic value, the data in Figure 5 shows that \nsuccessful proposals at high innovation levels had economic \nvalues slightly lower than other projects beginning at lower \ninnovation levels.  If additional research and development nfunds are excluded from the calculation \(red bars innovative \nproposals is more evident.   \n \n \nFigure 5 – Average Economic Value of Success Stories \n\(Excluding Success Stories with No Significant Economic \nValue Y-Axis X-Axis 


Red bars exclude additional research and \ndevelopment funding categories from the determination \nof economic value. \nData from a valuation of commercially successful success \nstories \(Figure 5 innovative proposals \ncan return comparable program value to other, less \ninnovative levels from the point of view of small business.  \nHowever, when the value categories of additional \ndevelopment funding are removed these proposals have \nsomewhat lower commercial value to NASA.  These \nvaluation metrics, however, are base on only measureable \ncommercial factors and do not provide a valuation for future \nbenefits to NASA programs by enabling new missions, \ncreating new research opportunities or providing new \nprogram innovations. \nThe number of good proposals the program has to select \nfrom each year is limited.  Proposals are ranked on their nprogrammatic and technical merit.  With each selection, \nthere is necessarily a decline in programmatic and technical \nmerit in the remaining pool.  Favoring proposals in anyone \nof the Technology Innovation Levels would necessarily \nincrease the decline in programmatic and technical merit of \nthose recommended.  Thus, any effort to avoid any category \nshould be carefully tempered by the inevitable decline in \nprogrammatic and technical merit of the final set of \nrecommended and awarded proposals \n \n0.00 1.00 \n2.00 3.00 \n4.00 5.00 \n1 2  3  4  5 \n0.00 1.00 \n2.00 3.00 \n4.00 5.00 \n6.00 \n1  2  3  4  5 \n  7 \n6. CHALLENGES SELECTING AN SBIR nPORTFOLIO \nIn a perfect market situation, a balance should be achieved \nbetween investment in R&D on basic research activity and \nless innovative development work directed at realizing a \ncommercial product.  The balance would be realized at the \nmargin where the last investment in each category, basic \nresearch or less innovative development work had the same \nexpected return on investment.  However, in a real market nsituation, there are several imperfections that may result in a \ndifferent outcome.  These imperfections may lead to a less \nthan optimal outcome for R&D investment programs from \nthe perspective of society and/or the funding \norganization.  We will examine this problem from the \nviewpoint of the NASA SBIR Program. \nProbably the most obvious market imperfection that can \ndistort the balance or trade-off between basic research and ncommercial product development is the uncertainty faced by \ndecision makers who are responsible for selecting R&D \nproposals for funding.  Specifically, the value of basic \nresearch work is much more dependent on an uncertain \nfuture environment.  In the case of NASA, for political as \nwell as a number of other reasons missions selected for \nfunding often change from what was previously \nanticipated.  If decision makers who are responsible for \nselecting proposals for funding are risk averse, they will \nfavor proposals leaning in the direction of near term \nutilization or commercialization that are characterized by \nmore predictable outcomes nWhat then are the factors that impinge on proposal selection \ndecision makers that would make them more or less inclined \nto embrace a higher level of uncertainty.  The most obvious \nfactor is that NASA missions in most cases only employ \ntechnologies that expose their missions to a minimum of \nrisk of failure.  This pushes the horizon outward for new \ntechnologies that result from basic research to a point of full \nmaturity.  The discounted present value is likely to be \nperceived as lower by decision makers. \nA second factor is that the resources available through the \nNASA SBIR Program are constrained to about $1 million \nfor a complete Phase I and Phase II contract.  In most cases, \nbasic research projects will require considerably more time \nand investment than more mature commercially oriented \nprojects.  In the case of a basic research project, the outcome \nis most likely limited to an advance in the technology that is \nconsiderably short of a marketable product.   In NASA \njargon, the SBIR project outcome would be limited to an \nadvance in the technologies readiness level, well short of a \nproduct ready for utilization.   The prospects for funding to \ncomplete the development of a basic research technology \nare necessarily more uncertain.   This concern is greater in \nthe case of a small business whose future is less assured \nthan a larger company. \nA third consideration is the ability of the firm to continue \nwith the development of the technology and bring it to a \nlevel suitable for NASA utilization.  In the case of work \nfunded at a small business, this adds additional degree of nuncertainty.  The small business is more likely to lose key \npersonnel, experience a change its direction etc., during the \nlong the time required to fully develop the technology.  This \nis a matter of perception on the part of those responsible for \nselecting proposals for funding, but it a rational \nconsideration. \nA fourth consideration is how well the proposed work \ncomplements existing NASA programs.  This consideration nwould appear to favor R&D projects with a shorter \ndevelopment time where the benefit is more \nevident However, NASA does have some significant R&D \nactivities where the complementary benefits of basic \nresearch could be significant.  For example, the SBIR \nproject could be investigation of an alternative approach to a nsignificant technical challenge that NASA would like to \novercome. \nThe implied direction of all of these factors are to drive \nselection to less innovative, less risky and more commercial \nproposals.  However, the counter factors in favor of more \ninnovation are the perceived higher return on investment of \ninnovation 11].  Opening new areas of research, or enabling \nnew types of missions can only come by taking risks.  The 


ndata we have in the form of success stories, however, does \nnot fully capture this additional value Innovation value is \ndifficult to quantify but clearly perceived as valuable, as \nevidenced by “Innovative being the “I” in SBIR. \nMoreover, if we step back to the national level, the \neconomic benefit of highly innovative research and \ndevelopment work is very likely considerably greater.  The \nknowledge gained is transferred to other organizations \nthrough the movement of employees between organizations, \npublications etc.  Technical progress through research and \ndevelopment work has long been recognized at the national nlevel. \nAs important as some of these considerations may be, they \nmay be overcome by two other important factors.  One of \nthose factors is what NASA expects the SBIR Program to \naccomplish.  Does NASA look to the SBIR Program to meet \nbasic research needs or do they look to the program to \nprovide useful technology development to meet upcoming \nmission needs?  The other factor is the potential biases of \nthose responsible for selecting proposals for award.   Are \nthese individuals from the research and development \ncommunity or are they from the project side of the NASA \norganization.  \n \n7. CONCLUSIONS \nUsing success story data collected over of the life of the \nNASA SBIR program it is possible to put an economic \nvaluation on each report and to categorize them by their \n  8 \nlevel of innovation.  Because the acquisition of these data \nhave not been standardized and program changes over the \nlife of the SBIR program have, at times, encouraged the nproduction of success stories with little economic value, the \nresults need to be interpreted historically Nevertheless, \nwhen average valuations are made for success stories at \neach innovation level, the most innovative proposals do not \ndemonstrate a significantly different value than other, less \ninnovative areas from the point of view of small businesses.  \nHowever, when the value categories of additional \ndevelopment funding are removed, these proposals have \nsomewhat lower commercial value to NASA.  \nThe danger here is to conclude that to increase the success \nof the SMD SBIR Program we should be selecting less \ninnovative and thereby less risky proposals.  The nature of \nthe data we have and the metrics derived from them \nmeasure only commercial value and do not capture the value \nof opening new doors for research and for NASA missions nExperience at the national level also suggests that the single \nagency perspective is incorrect.  The contribution of basic \nand fundamental research and development work to \nvirtually all aspects of our lives can hardly be overlooked.  \nMoreover, the opportunity to take on great challenges has \nalways been an important inspirational factor in this nation’s \nculture.  The NASA SBIR Program should be part of a \ngreater challenge as reflected in the exceptional mission \naccomplishments of this unique agency. \nEstablishing the balance between innovation and \ncommercialization is made difficult because there is a \nreward metric for successful infusion and \ncommercialization, but none for successful innovation.  In \ngeneral, the ultimate infusion and commercialization of \ninnovative solutions has a lower probability than \nimplementation of established ideas, but they can also have \na much higher return on investment.  \n \n8. RECOMMENDATIONS \nIf innovative ideas are valued and solicited in the SBIR \nprogram, then NASA technology requirements need to be nspecified in a way that defines the problem and possible \nsolution, but will also allow for different approaches and \nunconventional methods.  It may also be necessary to \nestablish a guideline to risk a percentage of awards on these \ninnovations.  The size of this percentage is dependent on \nmany cultural factors as well as the perceived risk to reward \nratio of innovation versus the return on investment for more nconservative solutions.  Ultimately, it would be helpful to \ndevelop a new metric that captures the value of innovative \nsuccesses.  To date these values are generally accepted as \ntrue, but have not been directly quantified. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe work described in this publication was carried out at the \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of \nTechnology under a contract with the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration. \nReferences herein to any specific commercial product, \nprocess or service by trade name trademark, manufacturer, \nor otherwise does not constitute or imply its endorsement by \nthe United States Government or the Jet Propulsion \nLaboratory, California Institute of Technology \n \nREFERENCES  \n [1] Office of the Chief Technologist SBIR/STTR Program \nSolicitation,  Desk Reference July 18- September 8, 2011, \nAmes Research Center \(NP-2011-6-01-ARC  SBIR www.sbir.gov \n[3] NASA Small Business Innovative Research \(SBIR  Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade \n2013-2023 \(2011 n\(ISBN-10: 0-309-22464-0  to 2015.

The prob-\nlem of mapping a multi-process or multi-threaded program\nto a set of underlying resources to minimize program execu-\ntion time is NP-hard [8 Various heuristics have been pro-\nposed with the objective of minimizing communication cost,\nsuch as graph partitioning [5] and graph matching [19]. [24]\nimplements a OS-level scheduler which places intensively-\ninteracting threads close to each other. As shown in this\npaper, arranging data movement based on cache topology\nalone does not capture all important trade-offs and may lead\nto sub-optimal overall performance.\nContention Aware Mapping.

Hardware [21] and OS level [17]\ncache partitioning, user level thread scheduling [34], and\ncompiler-time transformation [22, 25 are proposed to mit-\nigate resource contention among processes and/or threads.\nHowever, they only work for independent threads or pro-\ncesses with no communication or sharing relationships.\nHolistic Mapping. [26 exploits thread mapping for op-\ntimizing multi-threaded datacenter applications on CMPs.\nHowever, the mapping policies in [26] either use exhaustive\nsearch or require a new algorithm for each type of cache\ntopology. Our new contributions include an in-depth study\nof streaming application’s cache behavior and a holistic\nmapping algorithm which is more general and scalable.\nB. Optimizing Streaming Applications on CMPs\nAlgorithmic Optimization of Streaming Algorithms. Exam-\nples include join [27, 11], aggregation [6], sorting [10 and\nfrequency counting [7]. Operators in a streaming program\nmay interact with each other in complicated ways and\nsuch complexity is manifested at thread level at runtime.\nManaging such complicated interaction is beyond the scope\nof tuning individual operators, so orchastration provided by\nStreamMap is necessary to coordinate threads’ execution.\nBesides, StreamMap does not require knowledge of opera-\ntors’ internal implementation, and uses pro?ling information\ncollected at middleware level to make mapping decisions.\nTherefore, StreamMap is orthogonal and complementary to\ncode tuning of individual streaming operators.\nCompile-Time Scheduling and Mapping of Streaming Pro-\ngrams on CMPs. Pioneered by StreamIt [13], work has\nbeen done in optimizing static scheduling of streaming\nprograms on multicores [16, 29, 30]. Those work apply\ncompiler analysis and code transformation to exploit various\nparallelism in program to balance computation load among\nthreads. Since most of those work target Cell B.E. architec-\n630\nture which has explicitly managed memory hierarchy, they\ncommonly try to hide data movement cost by overlapping\ncommunication with computation in the execution schedule.\nIn comparison, StreamMap targets cache topologies seen in\nx86 CMP architecture which impose distinct challenges such\nas contention on shared resources, and it works at thread\nlevel without heroic compiler analysis.\nCache-Aware Optimization of Streaming Programs. [23]\nproposed three techniques to optimize StreamIt programs\non a uniprocessor: execution scaling, buffer manager, and\nregister replacement. [20] extends execution scaling to multi-\ncore. Both work assumes synchronous data ?ow model to\ncalculate static steady state schedule, and [20] does not\nconsider thread mapping to reduce contention or thread\nsynchronization cost 4] theoretically shows that cache-\nef?cient scheduling of streaming programs on a uniprocessor\ncan be modeled as a partitioning problem and some special\ncases can be solved in polynomial time. Our work targets\nmulti-core processors, uses mapping algorithms different\nfrom the one proposed in [4], implements those algorithms\ninside System S middleware, and evaluates them with real-\nworld applications on representative architectures.\nVII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper demonstrates that CMP’s cache topology can\nhave a signi?cant impact on the performance of multi-\nthreaded streaming applications. Our StreamMap approach\nautomatically places threads 


to cores to control the data\nsharing and resource contention between threads, and can\nimprove real-world streaming applications’ performance by\nup to 1.8 times over the default Linux OS scheduler.\nFuture directions of this research are twofold. We plan to\nstudy how to use StreamMap to provide feedback informa-\ntion to System S’ compiler to optimize operator fusion. We\nalso plan to apply StreamMap to a wider range of streaming\napplications, e.g., dynamic graph analysis.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Dynamorio: Dynamic instrumentation tool platform.\nhttp://www.dynamorio.org, October 2012.\n[2] Likwid: Lightweight performance tools.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/likwid, October 2012.\n[3] Scotch: Static mapping, graph, mesh and hypergraph partitioning.\nhttp://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/, October 2012.\n[4] K.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
