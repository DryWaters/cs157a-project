Feature location is the mapping of features onto static artifacts such as source code and configuration files Recent effective feature location methods use dynamic-analysis and scenarios, i.e. executable use-cases that represent features in source code. Almost all of these techniques require that a distinct scenario is created for every feature, which puts a great burden on developers due to the inherent manual work 
Abstract 
that needs to be carried out. First, since scenarios are typically created and exercised manually, the act of locating features is not easily repeatable as software evolves. Second, there may be dependencies between features, which will be reflected on the collected execution traces during scenario execution. For existing feature location methods to perform well, developers typically need to mark the execution traces manually to specify which parts of it exactly represent each feature. In this work we free developers of the manual process of creating scenarios by using association rule learning on a set of labeled test-cases i.e. test-cases labeled with the features they exercise in the existing test-suite of the system, to locate features in source code. We also provide an evaluation of our method on three

that can be executed on the system. As an example, "signon" is a feature of a chat system where the user signs on to the server with credentials Maintenance is one of the most costly and time consuming tasks in the lifecycle of a software system [1   To  perform maintenance, developers typically identify the parts of source code that are related to a specific requirement. This identification process is called 
  W i t h  feature location, developers typically identify specific constructs in source code, such as classes or methods, and use them as starting points for further investigation and program understanding to serve a maintenance task 
feature location 
Recent effective feature location techniques use static or dynamic analysis, or a combination of both. Static analysis based techniques analyze the static artifacts of the system e.g. source code and configuration files\ 5, 10 D y na m i c analysis based techniques [4, 9, 14, 15, 20 x er ci se  t h e system and collect information to later analyze and do feature location. There are also techniques that combine both static and dynamic analysis [6, 17, 18  Ou r w o rk is  bas ed on  dynamic analysis Another dimension of feature location techniques is whether they are interactive or automated. Interactive techniques [5, 6, 23 r e qu i r e  a  f e ed b ack  l o op   w h ere th e  u s e r  obtains more information about the location of a feature by 
interacting with the tool. Automated techniques [4, 13, 20  however, take in an initial input and perform automated or semi-automated analysis. Our work is in the area of automated feature location Dynamic analysis based feature location techniques typically use 
actions to trigger features on the system. While a scenario is executed, they collect execution traces \(e.g. method names, class names and call sequence and analyze them to do feature location. Almost all of these techniques assume that there will be one or more distinct scenarios for each feature and no others. Some techniques also use negative scenarios, i.e. scenarios that are completely unrelated to a feature, to prune irrelevant information for that 
scenarios 
feature Although recent techniques are known to work well, we observe that they have shortc omings on the assumptions they make. First, the requirement to have distinct scenarios for each feature puts a great burden on developers. Even though developers can potentially use existing test-cases as starting points and distill them into scenarios for features, this is still a manual task that is not repeatable reliably every time feature location needs to be performed. This is especially a bigger issue for users that are not very familiar with the system. Furthermore, negative scenarios are typically needed for some of the existing techniques, which puts more burden on users Second, if a process that automates the execution of the 
scenarios is not provided, it is very hard to keep consistent information to do feature location reliably as software evolves. If execution traces are collected while scenarios are executed manually \(e.g. on a graphical user interface of the system\eature location will not be repeatable as software is updated \(e.g. code is refactored such that classes/methods are renamed\, unless they are executed again on the updated system. Therefore, it is vital to have an automated process to execute scenarios without user intervention

Many techniques assume that a given part of the execution trace will be related to only a specific feature and no others. In the presence of dependencies between two features, the dependent feature's execution trace will inherently contain all of the depended featureês execution trace. Therefore, users will typically need to clean up the execution traces for such dependent features to get good feature location results. This is a cumbersome and error prone process for users. Furthermore, dependencies between features also make it hard \(and sometimes impossible\ to create scenarios for the dependent feature, since the scenario for the dependent feature should ideally only trigger that feature and no others In this paper, we bridge the shortcomings discussed above by considering the feature location problem as a data mining problem. Given a set of test-cases \(in the existing test-suite of the system\beled with the features they exercise, we automatically find relevant feature locations in source code using association rule learning [3 u r w o rk makes the following contributions 
   
We present a new way to do feature location to locate source code locations uniquely related to a feature, where users simply label some existing testcases from the system's existing test-suite. A testcase can exercise multiple features, and a feature may be tested in multiple test-cases We present a metric to guide users on the labelings they provide. If a feature cannot be located in a sufficiently reliable way, users are notified so that they can provide more labelings for that feature. This prevents users from labeling test-cases blindly without information on whether they provided enough input or not We provide tool support to automate the entire process so that feature location can be performed reliably and repeatedly in the presence of feature dependencies even though software is updated The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section II discusses background and related work; Section III explains in detail how our technique and tool \(FLMiner Feature Location Miner\ work; Section IV describes the evaluation of our technique; Section V discusses the pros and cons of our approach; Section VI concludes our work; and Section VII points out potential future work that can build and improve upon the work presented here II B ACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK  In this section, we provide a simple running example define terms used throughout the paper, and describe existing literature on feature location Consider a simple chat system where users can connect to the chat server, sign in with credentials send messages to each other and sign off. We use this example throughout the paper for discussion purposes A feature is a realized functional requirement of the system observable by users during their interaction with the system [6  In  ou r ex a m ple   and are all features. Note that, in the context of this work, non-functional features \(e.g. robustness and security\are not considered A scenario for a feature is a set of actions that trigger the feature on the system. For instance, in our chat system example, if there is a graphical user interface \(GUI provided, the acts of connecting to the server, signing in sending messages to friends and signing off through the interface are all scenarios, respectively, for the features described above. Scenarios can also be programs implemented using application programming interfaces APIs An execution unit is a source code entity of desired granularity. Examples are statements, blocks methods, classes and packages. In this work, we used the combination of classes and methods as execution units However, the granularity can be changed to have higher or lower resolution An execution trace for a scenario is the set of execution units collected while the scenario is executed. Execution traces can be collected in different ways, such as profiling A feature is said to be dependent to another feature if cannot be executed unless is executed. In our example, a user cannot send a message unless she signs on to the server first. So is said to depend on  An input for a feature location technique is the set of scenarios and their execution-traces, which contain execution units There is a large body of existing research on feature location. Before discussing existing techniques, we use a sample setup for our chat system example that demonstrates the assumptions of the existing techniques Table I lists features and scenarios in our example, which are exercised manually on the system through a GUI while the system is being profiled First, since existing techniques require creation of scenarios for each feature, this puts a great burden on developers. Furthermore, these actions are performed on the GUI manually in our example. Therefore, the collected execution-traces will contain execution units that are valid at the time these scenarios are executed. If the code is

Scenarios in Table I automated as small p ro g rams refactored, the execution traces will no longer be valid, and scenarios will need to be executed again. This is cumbersome for developers, therefore it is vital to automate this process To automate this, one can implement small programs as scenarios for each feature. This is demonstrated in Fig. 1 Each scenario contains code to exercise the respective feature annotated with the annotation

 Fi g ure 1 this is meta-information on the program and is not executed\. A user will need to implement these small programs to be used as scenarios, a cumbersome, labor-intensive and error prone process. Once implemented, these scenarios can be executed by a tool and their execution traces can be collected automatically. Note, however, that if the user is using an interactive technique \(one that needs feedback from the user as it processes the execution traces\, then the process of locating features will not be fully automated even though scenarios are captured as programs as in Fig. 1 Finally, some scenarios need to execute features other than the targeted feature due to feature dependencies. For instance, the program for needs to also execute and because it depends on both features Almost all techniques in the literature require that scenarios are as simple as possible and invoke a specific feature and no others. This is required to avoid noise in the analysis of execution traces and provide relevant feature locations for each feature. Therefore, a user will need to preprocess the execution traces of these scenarios to clean them up before applying a feature location technique. This is, again, a cumbersome, labor-intensive and error-prone process. These assumptions are common to almost all dynamic analysis based methods in the literature. In the rest of this section, we discuss relevant literature for our work A significant body of research exists on feature location Existing techniques can be classified in different dimensions two of which are discussed here. The first dimension is the type of analysis they use: static, dynamic or hybrid \(both dynamic and static\The second dimension is whether the technique is interactive \(uses a feedback loop to get more information from the user, and provides more information iteratively\ or automated \(uses an initial input, and then performs automated analysis Static analysis based techniques [2, 5, 10  an aly ze th e  static artifacts of the system \(e.g. source code and configuration files\o locate execution units specifically related to features.

It uses a set of scenarios that execute a feature, and a set of scenarios that do not \(negative scenarios\.

Furthermore, they find out the distribution of the implementation of a feature onto different components in source code \(such as classes and packages\as well as how much each component participates in the implementation of each feature Antoniol and GuÈhÈneuc [1 als o ex ten de d  4 w ith  statistical hypothesis testing, based on events that are observed in execution-traces, knowledge-based filtering, and multi-threading support Eisenbarth's interactive technique [6 s es f o rm al con c ep t  analysis, a mathematically sound technique to analyze binary relations, to assess the relationships between execution units and features. This technique provides information about unique execution units for each feature, which ones are shared and which are of interest to the implementation of a feature. In this regard, it provides both similar results as [20  and information on relationships between features. This technique combines static and dynamic analysis to increase coverage of the dynamic information obtained, and it is interactive, i.e. it relies on the user to guide the analysis process and to investigate different types of relationships suggested by Eisenbarthês tool to locate code specific to each feature Poshyvanyk et al.

If a certain execution unit is observed in all scenarios for a feature, they propose that there is a high probability that this execution unit is highly relevant to the feature. They also use information retrieval to index textual information in the source code to help rank the relevant execution units discovered with dynamic analysis

 Figure 2 FLM INER   F EATURE L OCATION M INER  In this section, we describe our technique in detail. Fig. 2 shows an overview of our technique with inputs and outputs We implemented a tool for this process: FLMiner Ö Feature Location Miner FLMiner takes in execution traces of test-cases, uses association rule learning to suggest highly relevant feature locations uniquely related to each feature, and finally outputs the found feature locations and some metrics on the quality of the found results as well as guidance for the user to provide more labeled test-cases, if need be, for higher quality results. We discuss each step in detail in the rest of this section  The input to FLMiner \(step 1 in Fig. 2\ is a set of testcases labeled with the features they execute. Fig. 3 shows a sample input to FLMiner for our chat system example. These test-cases are executed, and execution-traces are collected for each test-case \(step 2 in Fig. 2 Compared to the sample scenarios in Fig. 1, there are some important differences in the scenarios in Fig. 3. First the scenarios in Fig. 1 are either created manually, or distilled from existing test-cases in order to have as little noise as possible. Even though there are freely available tools for profiling and execution-trace collection, users may still need to do manual cleanup on the execution-traces due to dependencies, as discussed in the previous section Unlike the existing techniques, for FLMiner, users label existing test-cases in the test-su ite of the system with the features they execute, as in Fig. 3. If they exist, we make use of the available execution-traces collected by continuous integration tools. If not, we provide users with an AspectJ  s p e c t t o o u tp ut  d y na m i c  pr o f i ling info r m a t i o n. U s e r s donêt need to do cleanup after providing information on which features are executed by which test-cases As noted in [8  l o c a tin g f eatu res  w ith th e in p u t in Fig. 3, using existing techniques is a harder problem

Their approach is similar to [17 in th a t th ey  u s e d y n a m i c an aly sis t o f i n d  relevant locations for features first. Then, they ask users to perform queries relevant to the feature they are interested in to rank the locations found via dynamic analysis Edwards et al.

Distributed systems have some inherent difficulties such as time synchronization, being event driven and more Edwards et al. use causality analysis to overcome these challenges A different family of approaches builds on the feature location techniques described above to analyze the features themselves. These do not aim to solve the feature location problem, but rather use those techniques to process different properties of the features. We include them here for completeness. These techniques analyze feature relationships 8, 28  e v o l ut i o n o f fe at ur e s ac ro ss ver si o ns o f s o ft w a r e   12 and identifying canonical features of a system [16   All feature location techniques discussed above, except 6   as s u m e th e u s e of  dis ti lle d s cen ari os f o r e ach f eatu re  a s  discussed in section II-B. Therefore, they carry the risks and shortcomings previously discussed: the laborious task of creating scenarios, the difficulty of their maintenance and reliance on users to clean up dependencies in the scenarios To the best of our knowledge, [6  th e on ly  w o rk  w h ere use of scenarios that exercise multiple features is suggested and discussed. To find feature locations specific to a feature they look for those execution units that only appear in the scenarios executed for a feature and nowhere else. This is a result of the nature of formal concept analysis, since it makes binary decisions about the relationships between an execution unit and a feature. In the presence of dependencies between features, this technique may not find any feature locations specific to a feature at all, and require users to provide scenarios that exercise only that specific feature, i.e require the manual cleanup discussed in the beginning of this section. Furthermore, this technique is interactive, i.e. it requires feedback from users during operation and users need to analyze the lattice produced to identify the feature location suggestions  In this paper, we lift the assumptions of the existing techniques discussed at the beginning of this section. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that presents an end-to-end process to locate features in source code, along with automated tool support, using existing test-cases without any need to create scenarios III

because we do not have information on the order of the features executed in the test-cases. Furthermore, when the test-cases are executed and execution-traces are collected, we do not know which part of the execution-trace belongs to which feature. Therefore, there is inherent ambiguity in the information used by FLMiner. We call this ambiguity  Once the execution-traces are collected, FLMiner uses a data mining algorithm, namely association rule learning [3  to find highly relevant locations for each feature \(step 3 in Fig. 2\. Association rule learning [3  is a p o p u l a r  m e thod  in  data mining used to discover interesting relations between variables in a database. Formally, association rule learning works on a set of binary attributes, called and a set of transactions, called the Each transaction in  contains a subset of the items in  A is defined as an implication where and  To demonstrate these concepts, we use the chat system example. Assume that we execute the test-cases shown in Fig. 3 and obtain information on which methods are executed in each test-case, as shown in Table II. For our example, the items are the union of all methods observed in the execution traces and the features; and the transactions are the test-cases. In the table, a 1 denotes the existence of a method or feature in a test-case. As an example, for the test the execution-trace contains the methods   and and, as labeled by the user in Fig. 3, the features and are executed by the test-case In association rule learning, many different measures of interest and significance are defined [3  I n t h i s w o r k  w e us e Confidence is defined in terms of of a set of items  As an example, in Table II Next, the of a rule is defined as As an example, in Table II This tells us that it is highly probable that the existence of in an execution-trace implies that the feature was executed in that test-case. Confidence, given above, is in fact the conditional probability i.e. the probability that a test-case executes sign-on given that its execution-trace contains the method  For a method to be considered as a highly relevant location for a feature the confidence should be high. The confidence values for the rules between methods and features as described above is used, in part, by FLMiner to rank each method in deciding whether it is a highly relevant location for a feature or not. In our case studies, we set minimum confidence to 0.5 For a more in depth analysis of association rule learning we refer the reader to [3 An edge case for our technique is a single test-case that executes all features. In such a case, all confidence values of the form would turn out as 1. Obviously, this information is not helpful in choosing the highly relevant locations for features; because the confidence values turned out to be equal due to an anomaly, or by chance. In fact, as the input to FLMiner has more fuzziness \(more labels on a single test-case\, the confidence values found by FLMiner are expected to be less reliable. Based on this observation we present a new measure to perform an internal quality check on the confidence values found and detect this edge case Consider a feature and the set of all methods such that We consider the confidence values of all of the methods in as a probability distribution and find out how much this distribution is different than a uniform distribution. If the distance is small, as was the case for the worst-case scenario described above \(the distance is 0 for that case, because all methods have confidence 1, and is a uniform distribution then the confidence values are not very reliable. We call this distance and use KL-divergence [2  a w e l l known measure to calculate the distance between two probability distributions, to calculate it where is the probability distribution constructed using the confidence values of methods in as described above and is the discrete uniform distribution of the same size as Note that, the divergence value is the same for all methods in for a given feature It can be considered as an indicator of the quality of the feature locations for found by FLMiner, and how much FLMiner considers them as dependable for that feature Finally, we combine confidence and divergence to obtain a single metric to be used to detect highly relevant feature locations. Given a method and a feature

 Affinity combines confidence and divergence with equal weights, i.e. both confidence and divergence are equally important in determining whether a method is a highly relevant location for a feature. If need be, these weights can be adjusted based on the project properties Once affinities are determined for each \(method, feature pair, we rank the methods for a feature from high affinity to low affinity, and provide users with a list of the most highly relevant locations for each feature FLMiner will also output the divergence values for each feature. Since this is not a typical machine learning problem only providing more labeled input may not yield better results. Some choices of test-cases labeled will sample features more evenly and provide better results. To help users on choosing test-cases to label, FLMiner guides users to provide more labeled test-cases for those features with low divergence. This way, the affinity values of methods can be increased for those features and the user can be presented with locations that FLMiner has stronger belief on whether they are highly relevant locations or not. When users follow FLMinerês suggestions, FLMiner yields higher quality results. The user will then know whether or not to label more test-cases, and if so, for which feature \(instead of blindly labeling test-cases without any information on the quality of the results presented For our chat system example, Table III lists the affinity values calculated for each method, and the divergence values for each feature. The confidence values highlight some important observations. For divergence is 0 because the confidence values for all methods are equal for So, FLMiner assumes that the confidence values were found due to insufficient input, and will guide the user to provide more input for in order to provide better results For send-message is ranked highest \(it has the highest affinity\because it is only observed in the test-case where send-message is present, while it does not exist in the other execution-traces of the features and which are also labels of  The divergence of and are higher than that of and because they have more distinguishing information available, i.e and  are executed in almost all test-cases, while and have been specifically executed in certain test-cases Therefore FLMiner has stronger belief that its feature location suggestions are better for these features IV E VALUATION  To evaluate the effectiveness of FLMiner, we analyze it both theoretically and practically For comparison, we consider the same input as the existing techniques assume: a distinct scenario per feature. In such a case, the input would look like the one shown in Fig 1, where there is a separate scenario for each feature Furthermore, since most of the existing techniques assume that execution traces will be cleaned up so that each execution trace belongs to a single feature, we perform this operation too, i.e. we handle feature dependencies. We call this case the Note that, base case is a very good input for a feature location technique since the executiontrace for each scenario contains execution units for a single feature, which is known deterministically \(the execution traces will also naturally contain utility methods and other unrelated methods for a feature, which is expected by all feature location techniques In the base case, the results found by FLMiner are identical to the well-known technique by Poshyvanyk [17   In co ndi t i o n a l prob ab i l i t i e s a re used to ca l c ula t e t h e probability of a certain method to be a relevant location for a feature \(it combines this with static analysis as well, but we compare our method with its dynamic analysis part\ The measure we use as part of also represents conditional probabilities is the same for all methods for a feature, so it doesnêt affect the feature location suggestions when used to calculate for the base case Therefore, FLMinerês analysis and results are equivalent to 17 w h en p r es en t e d w ith bas e cas e as  in pu t   We use the base case, i.e. the results of [17  as a  b a s e lin e f o r o u r co m p a r is o n s in th e ev alu ati o n  we perform. If FLMiner can achieve performance close to the base case when it is used on non-base inputs, then we suggest that FLMiner will benefit users, since it allows simply labeling existing test-cases and provides users guidance on which feature to provide more test-cases for while freeing developers off the burdens discussed in Section II-B Below, we evaluate FLMiner for two cases: the ideal case and the practical case Since FLMiner considers the feature location problem as a data mining one and uses a machine learning algorithm to solve it, it is expected that given çenoughé labeled inputs, it should be able to yield the same results as for the base case

features, where and is the number of features. In such a case, an ideal input to FLMiner would be examples, where the labels of the test-cases are an enumeration of all of the  combinations of the features. As an example, for 3 features and the ideal input to FLMiner would be three test-cases, labeled with  and If such an çidealé input is provided to FLMiner, we show below that FLMiner can find the same feature locations as the base case in spite of the fuzziness Our analysis starts with the confidence value of a method for the feature in the base case. Assume that, in the base case This means method was observed in s execution-trace and possibly some other featuresê as well \(defined by  where or the ideal fuzzy input to FLMiner, the confidence will be To find this confidence value, we count how many execution-traces and are seen together, and divide it by how many execution-traces is observed in To analyze how the confidence values compare between base and ideal cases, we compare the ratio of the two confidence values as changes Therefore, the confidence values found in the ideal case will be a multiple f the confidence values found in the base case for all methods. Since divergence is calculated internally for each feature and is a linear transformation, it will not change the rankings found in the ideal case based on confidence values for the methods. As a result, in the ideal case, the methods will be ranked in the same order as they were ranked in the base case, and therefore FLMiner will find the same methods for each feature as relevant feature locations even in the presence of fuzziness Using the base and ideal case analysis above, we also analyze the result of changing fuzziness, i.e. different values of  Based on these, as fuzziness decreases e confidence for a method found in the ideal case approaches the confidence found in the base case. As fuzziness increases  the confidence of the methods approaches 1 Therefore, as expected, having higher fuzziness makes it harder for FLMiner to suggest highly relevant feature locations This concludes our analysis that, given the ideal number of labeled test-cases, FLMiner yields the same feature location results under fuzziness as the base case Unfortunately, for a certain it would be impractical to expect users to label test-cases. This could be a very large number of test-cases to label, and there may not even be that many test-cases in the test-suite of the system Therefore, the ideal case is not practical, but it is useful in showing the foundations of our technique In the next section, we evaluate FLMiner in a practical setting that can be realistically used by users In the practical case, we assess how many labeled testcases we can practically ask for from the users. Unlike the ideal case, it is not possible to mathematically calculate how FLMiner would behave since there is a wide range of possible inputs. Therefore, we performed regression experiments on case studies. We evaluated FLMiner on 3 case studies: a chat system used in teaching software at UCSD \(University of California, San Diego\, and the open source software projects Apache Pool [2 an d A p a c h e  Commons CLI [22  Ta b l e I V  lis ts in f o rm atio n ab o u t  c a s e  studies relevant to our experiments First, the base case expects test-cases for features Since FLMiner is trying to solve a more complex problem i.e. it doesnêt expect one scenario per requirement, it is expected that it will need more test-cases than An educated guess is that each feature is observed at least twice to deal with fuzziness. Therefore, we tested to see how FLMiner would perform if test-cases are provided for  features

This is expected to keep the needed number of test-cases to a minimum by guiding users to provide input where it is most needed for higher quality results, hence less work for users. Since users are expected to follow this guidance for high quality results, we used inputs that conform to this guidance in our experiments

To perform experiments, we first identified features for each case study through their documentation. Next, we created scenarios conforming to the base case, i.e. a distinct scenario for each feature \(including the cleanup needed due to feature dependencies\ Then we executed the scenarios and collected execution-traces for each feature using AspectJ   Next, we generated random inputs of different labelings using the execution traces for features obtained above: some with 1 feature, some with 2 and so forth, up to 6 \(we didnêt go beyond 6 because the maximum number of features in a test-case across all case studies was 5\. As an example, to simulate a test-case with 2 features, we simply combined the execution traces of 2 features from the base case and labeled the union with the two features. Note that, regardless of how the random input has been generated, the total number of test-cases is fixed to in each case study We generated the random inputs in two steps. First, we enumerated all possible labeling counts that add up to As an example, if a case study had 3 features, we enumerated all solutions to the following linear equation Here, for a given solution to this equation corresponds to the number of test-cases where there is a single feature  with 2 features, and with 3 features. By enumerating all solutions, we ensure that there was no skew on how we sample the random space while we generate the random inputs Then, for a given solution to the linear equation, we randomly chose features to assign to test-cases, such that each feature is used at least once. We repeat this process 100 times so that for a single solution to the linear equation, there are 100 random inputs to be used in our experiments To evaluate FLMinerês performance on the random inputs, first, we describe what a çhighly relevanté feature location is. Based on the existing literature, these locations are typically uniquely related to a feature. Therefore observing a highly relevant feature location in an execution trace implies that the scenario of that execution trace executed that feature Based on this observation, given the highest ranked feature location suggested by FLMiner for a feature and the execution trace of a test-case FLMiner is said to guess that executed if the execution trace of contains If is indeed a highly relevant feature location for then FLMinerês guess is correct For each case study, we manually created a baseline to assess how well FLMinerês guesses are, by looking at each test-case and finding out which features it actually executes Finally, we compared how well FLMinerês guesses were compared to the baseline, using the commonly used accuracy metric on retrieval problems   G i ve n a gue ss   made by FLMiner is either correct, a false-positive FLMiner guessed that a test-case executed a feature, but it was wrong\, or a false-negative \(FLMiner missed the fact that a test-case executed a feature\. Given the following sets     F-measure is calculated as   Furthermore, we also performed the same experiments with base case inputs to FLMiner for each case study and reported the f-measure values for the base case. As discussed in section IV-A, the base case for FLMiner is equivalent to Poshyvanykês method [1 T h er e f or e w e pro vid e a comparison of FLMinerês performance on fuzzy inputs with that of [17  on bas e  c a s e  in pu ts   Fig. 4 shows the results of our experiments, where we use  test-cases for features as input to FLMiner. In the graphs the line at the top for each case-study shows the f-measure obtained in the base case, which is equivalent to what would be obtained using the method in  T h e sc at t e r e d po i n t s  show the f-measure values obtained by FLMiner on the random experiments. Linear fit for the scattered points are also shown, with information on the average f-measure value obtained by FLMiner for each case-study As shown, FLMiner does not perform as good on fuzzy inputs as the base case. This is expected, since the fuzzy inputs are more complex than the base case. However, on average, FLMiner performs 83 Ö 97% as good as the base case, i.e. Poshyvanykês method [17  Fu rth e rm or e as  discussed in Section II-B, FLMiner does not require creating any scenarios and the preparation required on the executiontraces \(due to dependencies\, unlike the existing feature location methods. It only needs some labeled test-cases from the existing test-suite of the system Table V shows the results of the same experiment when the number of labeled test-cases is increased from as in Fig. 4\to When more labeled test-cases are provided FLMiner is expected to perform better because it has more information to learn from. As expected, using 3n examples increases the performance of FLMiner for all case-studies

mining on existing test-cases of a system to suggest highly relevant feature locations uniquely related to features Similar to existing dynamic analysis based feature location techniques, FLMiner makes use of scenarios. However, it has the following improvements over the existing techniques: \(a\t doesn't require users to create scenarios users can simply tag existing test-cases with the features they execute; \(b\ it doesn't require a distinct scenario for each feature, test-cases can execute multiple features and a feature can be executed in multiple test-cases; \(c\ it doesn't require users to perform cleanup on the execution-traces of scenarios due to feature dependencies FLMiner provides users guidance on the quality of the suggested feature locations and whether the results can be improved if more labeled test-cases are provided for a feature. Furthermore, it provides an end-to-end automated process to locate features from the execution of test-cases automatically to outputting feature location suggestions On fuzzy inputs, where a scenario can execute multiple features and a feature might be executed by multiple scenarios, our technique yields results, on average, within 83 97% of the results provided by a well-known successful technique [17 on b as e cas e in pu ts  a  dis tin c t s cen a r i o f o r  each feature Based on experiments on three case studies labeled test-cases yield the results described above, where there are  features. Furthermore, more labeled examples yield better results As future work, FLMiner can be complemented with static analysis to yield better results, as in [6, 17, 18   It c a n  also be improved to work for non-functional features Currently, we evaluate FLMiner against [1 b y  c o m b inin g execution traces of scenarios for each feature. As future work, we plan to evaluate it on the whole test-suite of each case study. As part of this experiment, we also plan to evaluate how fast it converges and stops for asking for more labeled test-cases. Finally, we plan to evaluate the interaction of developers and FLMiner to assess the usefulness of FLMinerês guidance on labeling test-cases as input VII A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was supported in part by NSF Grants CNS0932403 and 0729029, as well as a generous donation of phones by Qualcomm VIII R EFERENCES  1

Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
