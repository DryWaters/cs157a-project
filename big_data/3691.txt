predicted based on those of other attributes. The categorical and quantitative attributes are mainly dealt with in the problem of prediction In particular when dealing with quantitative attributes their domains are usually divided into equal-width or equal-frequency intervals But it caused some problems The first problem is that equal-width partitioning cannot embody the actual distribution of the data The second problem is caused by the sharp boundary In most cases the resulting intervals are not too meaningful and are hard to understand Ref uses fuzzy set to soften partition boundary 
of the domains, and presents the concept of fuzzy association rules but it does not present the partition algorithm that can embody the actual distribution of the data and does not present the mining algorithm for fuzzy association rules which fits for large databases Ref 3 uses the relational fuzzy c-means algorithm to partition the quantitative attributes into several linguistic terms, then the problem of mining association rules with linguistic terms is introduced by combining linguistic terms The relational fuzzy c-means algorithm can embody the actual distribution of the data 
Furthermore, linguistic terms can soften partition boundary But combining linguistic terms can obtain excessive association rules with linguistic terms so the mining algorithm cannot fit for large database In this paper quantitative attributes are fmt partitioned into several fuzzy sets by fuzzy c-means algorithm, and the search technology of Apriori algorithm is improved to discover interesting fuzzy association rules Then the prediction method with the variable threshold based on the fuzzy association rules is presented In this prediction method a little error between prediction value and actual value is allowed 
When the error is less than a given threshold prediction value is regarded as acceptable or rational The parameters of triangular fuzzy numbers are adjusted to improve the prediction accuracy by the genetic algorithm This prediction method can obtain the different prediction accuracies corresponding to the different error threshold chosen by the users The rest of this paper is organized as follows In section 2 Apriori algorithm is improved for mining the interesting fuzzy association rules In section 3 a prediction method with the variable threshold 
based on the fuzzy association rules is presented In section 4 an experiment is given. The conclusions are briefed in section 5 2 An algorithm for mining fuzzy association rules Let T=\(tl,f2,...,tn be a relational database f represents the j-th record in T let I iI,i2,-,im be the attribute set where i denotes a Boolean categorical or quantitative attribute t,[ik represents value of the j-tb 0-7803-78652/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE 2490 


record in attribute ik Values of the record in attribute need to be partitioned into several fuzzy sets for mining fuzzy association rules Let A and A be two values of the record in Boolean attribute then two values can be partitioned into two fuzzy sets A and A  where Categorical attribute with fewer values can be partitioned into several fuzzy sets with the same method Each quantitative attribute is partitioned into several fuzzy sets represented with triangular fuzzy numbers by FCM alg~rithm The method of representing fuzzy sets in triangular fuzzy numbers is as follows Let p be membership degree of x in the fuzzy set with center vi let x x  x We first find the samples with minimum membership degree at both sides of the center vt in Xh U let the left sample with minimum membership degree be XI its membership degree be pk\(x and let the right sample with minimum membership degree be X  its membership degree be x then the expression of triangular fuzzy numbers x with center vk is x-a a<x<v x<a or x>b lo I In order to mine fuzzy association rules we first construct a new database through original database T In this new database attributes are fuzzy sets values of the record in attributes are obtained as follows Let i be a fuzzy set of attributei  ik is an attribute in new database Value of the j-th record in attribute i is i;\(t,[i  i:\(t,[ik is membership degree of tj[ik with respect to fuzzy set i  In this new database because attributes are fuzzy sets we call attributes fuzzy attributes and I still is the fuzzy amibute set Let t,\(yk represent value of the j-th record in fuzzy attribute yk fj\(yt falls in O,l Let X=\(Y,,~-,YpIcl y Yp+,.-.Ypr7 c I XnY=0 A fuzzy association rule is an implication of the form X a Y The support and confidence of fuzzy association rule are defined as Ref 3 Definition 1 The support ofXis defined as follows Fuzzy attribute sets with at least a minimum support Definition 2 The support of X-Y is defined as are called frequent fuzzy attribute sets follows Definition 3 The confidence of X 3 Y is defined as follows Because tj\(yk falls in O,l we can how that all subsets of a frequent fuzzy attribute set must also be frequent according to definition 1 With the above findings it is easy to modify Apriori algorithm to mine fuzzy association rules 3 Prediction method with the variable threshold based on hiay rules Suppose we have obtained 1 rules as follows by the improved algorithm for mining fuzzy association rules If i is/,',and i,is  and im-,is/i then imisf j=1,2,-.,l where  are triangular fuzzy numbers To these fuzzy association rules we can use inference method of standard additive model to make prediction When input values of antecedents i i   im are xI  x2     xm respectively based on these fuzzy association rules we can obtain the prediction result of consequent i as follows Proceedings of the second International Confexence on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 2491

The optimizing process of genetic algorithm is to maximize the prediction accuracy by adjusting triangular fuzzy numbers in antecedent and consequence of the fuzzy association rules The whole process of the algorithm is described as follows I Load the initial data and set the parameters required for genetic algorithm Load training dataset, initial triangular fuzzy numbers of each attribute and fuzzy association rules obtained. Set the size of population L maximum number of generations T and set crossover probability P individual mutation probability P parameter of crossover a parameter of mutation b Use f count current generation 2 Generate initial generation Po Each individual forming the genetic population will consist of triangular fuzzy numbers of all attributes that have been encoded by real values Each triangular fuzzy number is represented by three real parameters The triangular fuzzy numbers of all attributes are joined into an individual C with the length H  C:,3.ij  which is shown as follows C a,,,b,,,c aq,b,,,c,l c c,,c,,...c where C,j codes the fuzzy partition of the i-th attribute 1 denotes the number of fuzzy sets that the I-th attribute is partitioned and m denotes the number of attributes The encoded initial fuzzy partition is taken as the first individual of initial generation denoted as Cp  and other initial individuals are generated randomly according to the variable range of each gene Each gene c,,h  1,2  H is the parameters of fuzzy numbers and their variable ranges c:,c are identified by Cp The variable ranges of three parameters C,,C~+~,C of a fuzzy number are the following C,*I c 2 1 C,+I  c c,+2 cw A C,+I  c  c:,c:]=[c  c 2 2 c:+,>C:+,l  C,+I  I I c,+2 c c,+z  C,*I cr*2 C,+2J,+21 k,*2  Since the size of population is L initial generation can be denoted as Po  Cp,C  C 3 Evaluate individuals To each individual of current generation population P  we use function E to evaluate its degree of adaptation Smaller the value of error function is higher the individual adaptation is through genetic operators this process consists of three steps as follows 2 4 Generate a new generation A\Selection Applying the selection schemes of stochastic universal sampling and keeping the elitist we generate parent individuals from current generation for other genetic operators P B Crossover The Max-Min-Arithmetic crossover operator is applied to the selected individuals according to the crossover probability P If the two individuals is crossed are C  c  ch _ c and C  c  c  c then four offsprings are generated as follows c  n C l-o C  a Cy  1 a C C with C min\(c,,c C with C max\(c,,c Select the best two of them as the results of the crossover operator where a is a constant that is set beforehand C Mutation The nonuniform mutation operato is applied to the 2492 


Proceedings of the second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 selected individuals according to the mutation probability P Suppose that mutation is happened on the gene cI E[c:,c of an individual C  c _ ck  c  and generate new individual C c _ c _ c The process of mutation operator is as follows c1 A\(t,c ck p 0 1 ck-A\(f,ck-c B=l where p is a random integer of OJ function A\(t,y returns a value of 0 y such that the function value tends to zero with the augment of f Here we choose A\(t,y  y\(1 r   where r is a random value of 0,1 T is the maximum number of generation f denotes current generation and parameter b determines the degree of dependence to the iterative number c  B Lf 5 Check the condition of termination The iteration terminated until to the maximum number of generation T otherwise retum to the third step and begin a new iteration In the prediction method with the variable threshold based on the fuzzy association rules, the users can choose a different error threshold Ae according to the actual need and can obtain different parameters of triangular fuzzy numbers and prediction accuracy at the same time So this prediction method is flexible and effective 4 Experimental analysis Experimental database Abalone is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository which has nine attributes and 4177 records Each attribute is quantitative except for the attribute sex. Attribute sex is denoted as io quantitative attributes are denoted as il....,i8  Nine attributes are partitioned into three fuzzy sets these fuzzy sets are denoted as im\(l Z 3 0,1,...,8  We use the former eight attributes io  i to predict the attribute rings which denotes the age of abalone In order to make prediction it is required to mine fuzzy association rules with such as If io is io\(Io i is I We randomly select 2784 records in database as the training samples,' the rest records as the testing samples 300 interesting fuzzy association rules are mined to make prediction Let T=lOOO L=61 P,=0.6 P,,,=O.I 0.35 b=5 Ae  2  using the prediction method in section 3 we get the prediction precision 72.5575 on the training samples and the testing precision 71.0696 on the testing samples. Although the prediction precision is not perfect then i is i 1,=1,2,3 m=0,1,...,8  r and should he improved farther we claim that the prediction precision is acceptahle in this high-dimensional system with nine attrihutes 5 Related works Lent Swami and Widom propose association rule clustering system ARCS This system mines association rules based on clustering and then uses these rules to classify, but this system is only fit for the case, which there are only two attributes in a rule. Liu Hsu and Mac9 propose classification based on associations CBA which uses iterative method to find the frequent and accurate'possihle rule set and then uses method of elicitation to build classification system. But it is important to note that the intervals involved in quantitative association rules may not be concise and meaningful A method for constructing fuzzy decision trees FID and a number of inference procedures based on conflict resolution in rule-based systems and efficient approximate reasoning methods have been presented in IO Given a database, this approach can he used to build a fuzzy decision tree and the resulting tree can be used for inference in lo A fuzzy approach that can be used for mining interesting rules for classification with degree of membership in 11,12 This approach represents the revealed regularities and exceptions using linguistic terms The use of linguistic terms allows human users to understand the discovered rules better because of the affinity with the  human knowledge representation Furthermore this approach is capable of finding interesting relationships among attributes without any subjective input required of the users Some results show that the classification methods in 11,12 have good accuracy and interpretability than C4.5, CBA and FID 6 Conclusion Quantitative attributes are first partitioned into several fuzzy sets by fuzzy c-means algorithm and search technology of Apriori algorithm is improved to discover interesting fuzzy association rules Then we present a prediction method with the variable threshold based on the interesting fuzzy association rules In this prediction method a little error between prediction value and actual value is allowed When the error is less than a given threshold prediction value is regarded as acceptable or rational The parameters of triangular fozzy nurnbers are adjusted to improve the prediction accuracy by the genetic algorithm last Because the users can choose a different error threshold, and can obtain different prediction accuracy this prediction method is more flexible and effective 2493

we used simple homogeneous fuzzy partitions with no membership tuning our fuzzy rule-based system with a 100 classification rate in Fig 7 outperformed the reported result in 9 Castillo et al lo reported a 96.76 average classification rate on test data 30 of the wine data where the average number of fuzzy rules was 5.2 over five independent trials Since their SLAVE algorithm used a union i.e disjunction of multiple linguistic values as a single antecedent fuzzy set fuzzy rules in IO are more complicated than our fuzzy rules in Fig 6 and Fig 7 That is more fuzzy rules with higher complexity were obtained in lo than our fuzzy rule-based systems in Fig 6 and Fig 7 From computer simulations using the LV1 procedure we obtained a 96.1 average classification rate on test data by three fuzzy rules of the average length 2.33 and a 97.2 average classification rate on test data by three fuzzy rules of the average length 2.67 I I XI x7 47 lconseauent I Fig 6 Three fuzzy rules with a 94.9 classification rate Fig 7 Three fuzzy rules with a 100 classification rate V CONCLUSIONS In this paper we examined four heuristic definitions of rule weights in fuzzy rule-based classification systems First we proposed two heuristic definitions using the confidence of fuzzy association rules Next we described the characteristic feature of each definition Through computer simulations on an artificial test problem we illustrated the drawback of each of the two existing definitions Then we compared the four definitions with one another through computer simulations on the wine data We also examined the case with no rule weights by assigning the same rule weight to all fuzzy rules Simulation results showed that the use of rule weights improved the classification performance of fuzzy rule-based systems Among the four definitions the best results were obtained from a proposed one where the rule weight of each fuzzy rule was defined by the difference between the largest and the second largest confidence Finally we demonstrated that very simple fuzzy des with rule weights have high classification ability as well as high interpretability We used a genetic algorithm-based rule selection method for finding non-dominated rule sets with respect to three objectives to maximize the classification accuracy to minimize the number of fuzzy rules and to minimize the total rule length Since the number of fuzzy rules and the total rule length were minimized very simple rule sets were obtained by a three objective genetic algorithm While those rule sets were very simple, they had high classification ability This is because an appropriate rule weight was specified for each fuzzy rule by the proposed definition Reference I H Ishibuchi and T Nakashima 223Effect of rule weights in fuzzy rule-based classification systems,\224 IEEE Trans on Fuzzy Systems vol 9 no 4 pp 506-5 15 August 2001 2 0 Cordon M J del Jesus and F Herrera 223A proposal on reasoning methods in fuzzy rule-based classification systems,\224 International Journal of Approximate Reasoning vol 20 pp 21-45 January 1999 3 H Ishibuchi K Nozaki and H Tanaka 223Distributed representation of fuzzy rules and its application to pattem classification,\224 Fuzzy Sets and Systems vol 52 no 1 pp 2 1-32 November 1992 4 H Ishibuchi, T Yamamoto and T Nakashima 223Fuzzy data mining Effect of fuzzy discretization,\224 Proc of 1st IEEE International Conference on Data Mining pp 000400 November 2001 5 R Agrawal and R Srikant 223Fast algorithms for mining association rules,\224 Proc of 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp 487-499 September 1994 Expanded version is available as IBM Research Report RJ9839 June 1994 6 H Ishibuchi T Nakashima and T Morisawa 223Voting in fuzzy rule-based systems for pattem classification problems,\224 Fuzzy Sets andsystem vol 103 no 2 pp 223-238 April 1999 7 S M Weiss and C A Kulikowski Computer Systems That Learn Morgan Kaufmann Publishers San Mateo 1991 8 H Ishibuchi T Nakashima and T Murata 223Three-objective genetics-based machine learning for linguistic rule extraction,\224 Information Sciences vol 136 no 1-4 pp 109-133 August 2001 9 M Setnes and H Roubos 223GA-based modeling and classification Complexity and performance,\224 IEEE Trans on Fuzzy Systems vol 8 no 5 pp 509-522, 2000 IO L Castillo A Gonzalez and P Perez 223Including a simplicity criterion in the selection of the best rule in a genetic hzzy learning algorithm,\224 Fuzzy Sets and Systems vol 120 vol 2 pp 309-32 1,200 1 0-7803-7280-8/02/$10.00 a2002 IEEE 913

terns such as CLOSET 7 and CHARM B have been de veloped However these methods all require a user-specified support threshold Our algorithm does not need the user to provide any minimum support and in most cases runs fater than two efficient algorithms CHARM and CLOSET which in turn outperform Apriori substantially 7 81 Fu et al Z studied mining N most interesting item sets for every length 1 which is different from our work in several aspects 1 they mine all the patterns instead of only the closed ones  2 they do not have minimum length constraintssince it mines patterns at all the lengths some heuristics developed here cannot be applied and 3 their philosophy and methodology of FP-tree modification are also different from ours To the best of our knowledge this is the first study on mining topk frequent closed patterns with length constraint therefore we only compare our method with the two best known and well-performed closed pattern mining algorithms 5.2 Generation of association rules Although topk frequent itemsets could he all that a user wants in some mining tasks in some other cases sjhe wants to mine strong association rules from the mined topk fre quent itemsets We examine how to do this efficiently Items in the short transactions, though not contributing to the support of a topk itemset of length no less than mind may contribute to the support of the items in it Thus they need to be included in the computation which has minimal influence on the performance To derive cor rect confidence we have the following observations 1 The support of every Liternset is derived at the start of min ing 2 The set of topk closed itemsets may contain the items forming subsetjsuperset relationships and the rules involving such itemsets can be automatically derived 3 For rules in other forms, one needs to use the derived topk itemsets as probes and the known minsupport as threshold and perform probe constrained mining to find the support only related to those itemsets 4 As an alternative to the above one can set mind 2 which will derive the patterns readily for all the combinations of association rules 5.3 Pushing constraints into TFP mining Constraint-based mining 14.61 is essential to topk mining since users may always want to put constraints on the data and rules to be mined We examine how different kinds of constraints can be pushed into the topk frequent closed pattern mining deep into the TFP-mining process he succint constraints should be pushed deep to select only those itemsets hefore mining starts and the anti-monotonic Constraint should be pushed into the iterative TFP-mining process in a similar way as FP-growth Second for monotone constraints the rule will also be similar to that in traditional frequent pattern mining is if an itemset mined so far e.g okd satisfies a constraint sum 2 loo adding more items such as e still satisfies it and thus the constraints checking can be avoided in further expansion Third for convertible constraints one can arrange items in an appropriate order so that the constraint can be trans formed into an anti-monotone one and the anti-monotone constraint pushing can he applied First succinct and anti-monotone constraints can be pushed Interested readers can easily prove such properties for top k frequent closed pattern mining 6 CONCLUSIONS We have studied a practically interesting problem mining top-k frequent closed patterns of length no less than mind and proposed an efficient algorithm TFP with several opti mizations 1 using closednodexcount and descendantsum to raise mindupport before tree mining 2 exploring the topdown and bottom-up combined FP-tree mining to first mine the most promising parts of the tree in order to raise rninsupport and prune the unpromising tree branches and 3 using a special indexing structure and a novel closed pattern verification scheme to perform efficient closed pat tern verification Our experiments and performance study show that TFP has high performance In most cases it out performs two efficient frequent closed pattern mining algo rithms CLOSET and CHARM even when they are running with the best tuned minsuppwt Furthermore the method can be extended to generate association rules and to incor porate user-specified constraints Based on this study we conclude that mining topk fre quent closed patterns without minsupport should be more preferable than the traditional minsuppwt-based mining for frequent pattern nuning More detailed study along this direction is needed including further improvement of the performance and flexibility at mining topk frequent closed patterns as well as mining topk frequent closed sequential patterns or structured patterns Acknowledgements We are grateful to Dr Mohammed Zaki for providing the code and data conversion package of CHARM and promptly answering many questions 7 REFERENCES I R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithm for mining 2 A W.-C.
