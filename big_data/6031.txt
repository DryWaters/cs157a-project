Finding association patterns among these events has great signi?cance. Traditional data mining methods have several problems while applied to climate science data directly so we propose a novel method that mining frequent patterns among unusual events in climatic data, including spatial clustering algorithm based on tight clique, extracting unusual climate events algorithm and extended generalized sequential pattern \(EGSP algorithm. In order to verify our method, we do experiments on real climatic data \(Climatic data of East Asian monsoon zone and ?nd lots of well-known and previously unknown patterns. It needs the climatic expert to judge whether the new patterns are signi?cative. Overall, the experiment told us it was an effective and viable method for the climatic research I. INTRODUCTION Climate system is very complex. Climate is different between different areas because of different conditions. However climate system is a unitary system. In varying climate conditions there are interactions between climate events in a certain range that may form some association patterns. The disasters caused by unusual climate events often make a great deal of injuries and loses in life and the loses in wealth. To discover the spatio-temporal patterns of unusual climate events is very 


important. It can help us to understand the changing process of climate, ?nd its rule and enhance the prediction capability With the developments of modern-day technologies, climate science data grow explosively. Due to the overwhelming volume and high resolution of datasets, traditional climate science data analysis methods are not enough. Much of the data acquired at great expense remains greatly under-exploited As a new way to discover hidden patterns in huge amount of data, data mining can help climatic experts to explore the data. There are lots of works using the data mining methods in climatic research. However, there are several problems while applied the method to climate science data directly First, the traditional clustering method does not consider the Xie Kunqing is the correspondent author This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.60703066 and No.60874082 spatio-temporal changes of the process climatic data. Second ordinary events are not only complicated but also meaningless Unusual events are important and useful for the research of climate. Third, Traditional sequence association rule mining method is suitable for mining common patterns in various regions, rather than mining the relationship between the regions To solve the three problems above, we propose a method that mining frequent patterns among unusual events in climatic data. This paper is mainly about applying data mining method to climate science data and our work is as follows 1 a clustering algorithm based on tight clique. The clustering algorithm considers the properties of the climate changing character as a similarity measure indicator, and form clusters based on this type of similarity measure. This part of work can be found in Ref. [1 2 Considering unusual climatic events commonly take place in a huge area and a changefully spatio-temporal range, we merge the result of extraction in both spatio ?eld and temporal ?eld after extracting unusual climate events in each cluster. This step reduces the complexity of the frequent patterns mining We extended the classic generalized sequential pattern \(GSP algorithm, and apply it to the ?eld of frequent pattern mining 3 monsoon zone. We focus upon the East Asian monsoon 


zone that China is located in. The monsoon system is very unstable and has a large interannual variation. The formation mechanism of drought, water-logging, cold, heat and other disasters under the in?uence of the East Asian monsoon was studied by many meteorologists. They found that there would be some interesting patterns brought by the unequal distribution of the east Asia monsoon. We do experiments on climatic data of East Asian monsoon zone and ?nd lots of wellknown and previously unknown patterns. It needs the climatic expert to judge whether the patterns are signi?cative The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related work. Section 3 is the unusual climate events extracting algorithm. Section 4 is the extended gener978-1-4244-7739-5/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE alized sequential pattern mining algorithm. Section 5 reports experimental results. We conclude our study in section 6 II. RELATED WORKS Statistical methods are widely used in climate science but they can not well deal with the overwhelming volume of data Methods of data mining are used in the ?eld of meteorological science. Ref.[2] used shared nearest neighbors \(SNN similarity measure indicator clustering the temperature data of surface seawater. Ref.[3] clustered trajectory of hurricane by expectation-maximization \(EM regressive model. Ref.[4] proposed a hierarchical classi?cation algorithm to solve a land cover classi?cations problem The co-location rule in Ref.[5] was used to discover nonsequential pattern between different regions and mainly to ?nd the association rule among the events which happened in the same time and the location conform to some spatial relationships. Ref.[6] presented a Depth-First-Search algorithm \(DFSMINE environmental data which is different with GSP. Ref.[7] got a traditional transactional database by pre-processing of remote sensing image, then used the method of Ref.[8] used P-tree to store transactions to deal with remote sensing data. Ref.[9 present an ef?cient method for mining frequent sequential association rules from multiple sequential data sets with a time lag between the occurrence of an antecedent sequence and the corresponding consequent sequence There is one key problem in all above researches: how to process the climate dataset into traditional transactional 


database? Then we may use the traditional methods of association rule mining. Ref.[10] reviewed four modes to process the earth science data into transactional database 1 2 3 4 Ref.[8] and [11] belong to the 1st mode. Ref. [7] and 12] fall into the same category with the 2nd mode. To the 4th mode, Ref. [10] only presented a primary process First, choosing a few interested areas and climate parameters Second, add every climate parameter into all the points of the areas as a variable and get a new transactional database. Third use the method of Ref. [13] in the new transactional database III. UNUSUAL CLIMATE EVENTS EXTRACTING A. Extracting unusual climate events in each cluster Climate disaster means the disaster brought on by large range, long time unusual climate. The unusual climate could bring on drought, ?ood, chilling injury, sandstorm and so on In this paper, we use the data of temperature and precipitation to judge whether the unusual climate events take place. The judging standard includes the frequency and strength Def 3.1: Frequency threshold of unusual climate event Frequency threshold of unusual climate event is the time interval of the unusual climate event taking place, denoted as is higher, the unusual climate event is more infrequent Def 3.2: Unusual climate event. To one area, under a given frequency threshold of unusual climate event ?, choose all time points which property value ful?lls the threshold condition making up a dataset T. p is a threshold indicating the upper scale between maximum value MAX and average value. If the property value of a time point is in this range, we de?ne this time point a climate unusual high event. q is a threshold indicating the lower scale between minimum value MIN and average value. If the property value of a time point is in this range, we de?ne this time point a climate unusual low event The climate unusual high event and climate unusual low event are generalized as climate unusual event Def 3.3: Formal representation of unusual climate event An unusual climate event is denoted as C = ?P,E, T ? , where C is an unusual climate event, P is the location that unusual climate event takes place and could be a spatial extent or a set 


of spatial cluster labels, E is the type of unusual climate event including drought, ?ood, chilling injury, heat and so on, could be lone type or a combination of several types such as ?ood adding chilling injury. T is the duration of unusual climate event, a single number means unusual climate event happens in one month and a series of number means it continues for several months In this de?nition, the unusual climate events extracting algorithm is as follows 1 into the ?rst n items or last n items of climate property values in one location. According to domain knowledge, during a de?nite period of time, the corresponding time interval of the rst or last n categories of climate property values expresses the frequency of unusual climate event. For example, during 100 years, if the maximum value of precipitation in one area is v1 the unusual climate event v1 is once every 100 years If the next to the highest one of precipitation in one area is v2 the unusual climate event v2 is once every 50 years without consideration of the time interval between v1 and v2 2 the ?rst or last n categories of property values in one area 3 and q then get the unusual events sequence of one area B. Merge the result in both spatio ?eld and temporal ?eld The neighborhood unusual events in time or space indicate the same event. If we do not merge the result for the next step of data mining there would be many reduplicate counts that may hide the real signi?cative information 1 1 moth in the candidate set C and choose an event to the result set R. We use the cluster label A expresses the unusual event 2 With each step, we choose one cluster B from Q. If B have the same unusual climate with A we put B into R and put the neighborhood clusters of B into Q. Otherwise, choose the next cluster in Q for judgement until Q is empty 3 Delete the clusters in R from the candidate set C and repeat above steps until C is empty 2 1 unusual event E, search forward for all the same type unusual 


climate event in the new data set after merging in space 2 borhood in space we merge the events into one event and let the duration of unusual climate event T a set of time IV. FREQUENT PATTERNS MINING The purpose of frequent patterns mining of unusual climate events is to ?nd the relationship of unusual climate in different areas. These unusual climate events may take place in the same time or with some time delays. This kind of frequent patterns is interesting rules to meteorologists                           Fig. 1. Frequent patterns mining of climate Figure 1 shows a unusual climate queue of an area during 12 months. There are some locations with the label a,b,c. H is unusual high event. L is unusual low event. In this paper our goal is to ?nd all frequent patterns among these different locations. For example, the rule expressions in the form aL 


cH , which means after the unusual low event take place in location a, an unusual high event will happen in location c A. Sliding time window Since the annual cycle climate changing, the time interval of the relationship between two locations could not exceed one year. We add a time window to the unusual climate sequeue within 12 months. As shown in Figure 1, the window length is 3. For each month, item Ip is the unusual climate taking place at the same time and all these items combining to event el. The events in a certain window make a sequeue s. There are 11 window that length is more than 1, so there are 11 different queues. We pay attention to ?nd the frequent subsequences of all queues. The frequent sub-sequences that we found cover all locations, so it could express the relationship among different locations B. Time aligning Using the traditional GSP algorithm, there would be many redundancy and reduplicate counts. For example, to the rule aH ? cH , aH appears in the 2nd time point of window 1 and cH in 3rd, count plus 1. In window 2, they appear in the 1st time point and 2nd, so count plus 1 again. To avoid this kind of reduplicate counts, we add a limit of time aligning to the original GSP algorithm: counting only when the ?rst event of the rule aligning to the ?rst time point of current window With the limit of time aligning the count would not duplicate with the sliding window C. EGSP algorithm EGSP \(Extended Generalized Sequential Pattern at climate mining, but it also can be used for general sequential pattern mining 1 2 association rule mining The function of candidacy generation is same with GSP algorithm D. Scenarios of EGSP algorithm 1 base on the original clustering result neglecting to merge in space and time 2 forms a new set of unusual climate event with merging the original result in space and time. We can divide the East 


Asia Monsoon Zone into several parts and mine patterns in the division. The standard of division may base on domain knowledge. In this paper, we divide the range into two parts South and North V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS We use real global data for experiments. Global climate datasets CRU TS 2.10[14] contains nine variables including monthly average precipitation, monthly average temperature etc and we mainly use variables of monthly average precipitation, monthly average temperature A.

Otherwise, if the Paci?c Monsoon is power, the rainfall belt staying at north in the long term, there will be the phenomena as drought in south and ?ood in north. The results indicate the correctness and the feasibilities of our methods VI. CONCLUSION Climate system is a unitary system. With the interaction among climate elements there are many different climate phenomena so there are some relationship among the climate phenomena. Mining the spatio-temporal patterns we can delve more deeply into climate system and discover the law behind the climate phenomena. In this paper, we mine frequent Patterns of Unusual Climatic Events in Climatic data of East Asian monsoon zone. We propose tight clustering algorithm Unusual Climate Extracting Algorithm and Extended generalized sequential pattern algorithm. In the experiments, we got some interesting climate rule REFERENCES

CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules extracted.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
