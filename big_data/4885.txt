different approach to associative classification in that it does not directly use the rules generated by ARM, but only uses the frequent itemsets and their respective counts to build a classifier using a FOIL-like technique called PRM. Even before the advent of associative classifiers, many nonassociative classifiers were proposed, prominent of which is C4.5, which is a widely known decision tree classifi  and Ri  The principle of maximum entropy has been widely used for a variety of natural language tasks [22  A C M E  1 6  use s  it for binary data classification with mined frequent itemsets as constraints, discusses the failure of maximum entropy model to accommodate closed constraints, and proposes solutions to this problem. In fact, closed itemsets were first defined by Zaki in Thabtah in prov i d es a v e ry det a i l e d su rv e y of cu rre n t  associative classification algorithms. The author has compared most of the well-known algorithms, like CBA CMAR, and CPAR among others, highlighting their pros and cons, and describing briefly how exactly they work. He lays more emphasis on pruning techniques, rule ranking, and predication methods used in various classifiers, and also provides valuable insights into the future directions which should be undertaken in associative classification In [6 ller m eier p r o v id es a d etailed o v erv i e w o f fu zz y  methods as applied to data-mining.

PERFORMANCE STUDY In this section, we describe the performance study model that has been used for testing FACISME using three mostwidely-used disparate UCI Machine Learning \(ML\ datasets namely iris, breast, and pima. These three datasets are disparate from each other on various facets \(like number of attributes, type of attributes \226 numerical or binary, size of dataset, and type of dataset \226 dense or sparse\his makes any experimental analysis performed simultaneously on all the three datasets reliable and veracious, and such that its covers a wide range of aspects on which testing of classification accuracy and performance can be done The performance of FACISME has been compared with that of other state-of-the art classifiers, and the results of the same are detailed in section 6.A. Specifically, the classifiers used for comparisons are  200  Classification based on Predictive Association Rules CPAR 200  Classification based on Multiple Rules \(CMAR\8  200  Classification based on Associations \(CBA  200  C4.5 [22  200  Ri  200  Fuzzy Round-Robin Ripper \(FR3  200  Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm FURIA  200  Structural Learning Algorithm in a Vague Environment \(SLAVE    For the experiments on FACISME, we downloaded the raw datasets from the UCI ML website. These datasets then underwent the fuzzy pre-processing, mentioned in section 3 before being used to generate fuzzy frequent itemsets. To generate the fuzzy frequent itemsets that are used by FACISME, we have used the fuzzy ARM algorithm described in T h e m i n i m u m su pport u s ed f o r t h e f u zz y ARM process in order to build the fuzzy classifier, for all the three datasets, was 0.2 All the experiments were performed on an AMD 2600 Sempron PC with 512 MB main memory. All the approaches have been implemented by their authors with the parameters that they have used for testing. For CPAR, the best five rules are used for prediction. In all the experiments of FACISME and other associative classification algorithms\uracy is measured using the 10-fold cross validation. We implemented FACISME using Java on Windows XP. The results of the remaining algorithms i  e  excepting FACISME\aken from  2 4 25   A. Experimental Results As mentioned above, three standard UCL-ML datasets have been used to illustrate the efficacy of FACISME in terms of accuracy and simplicity of use. Figures 4, 5, and 6 illustrate the experimental results to test accuracy obtained for various classifiers on each of the three UCI-ML datasets Fig. 4 shows the accuracy obtained by each classifier on the iris dataset. FACISME performs the best in terms of accuracy as compared to the other datasets. From fig. 5 we get to know the accuracies for all the classifiers on the breast breast cancer\et. And, FACISME performs nearly as well as the most accurate classifier for this dataset. Finally fig. 6 depicts the results of the experimental analysis done on pima dataset. Even in this case, FACISME performs the best as compared to the other classifiers. Thus, the basic inference from this experimental analysis is that FACISME consistently performs very well on the basis of accuracy, and is even the best in two cases Each of the classifiers \(excepting FACISME\used in this experimental analysis are crisp in nature, and thus use sharp partitioning to convert numerical attributes to binary attributes. Normally 5-6 sharp partitions are used, but these can extend up to 10 or more depending on the nature of the 


numerical attribute e  g the attribute Age which is generally in the range 0-100, can be divided into six sharp partitions namely 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75, 76 and above. In case of FACISME, fuzzy sets are used instead of sharp partitions, in order to convert numerical attributes to fuzzy partitions. The attribute Age can be divided into three fuzzy partitions, namely Young, Medium-aged, and Old, with each value of age belonging to each of the three fuzzy partitions with some membership value 265 Thus, the number of sharp partitions that need to be used to handle a numerical attribute is far greater than the number of fuzzy partitions required to do the same. Moreover, this leads to better understanding by the user as there are few well-defined fuzzy partitions with linguistic names/meanings like Young and Old, as opposed to sharp partitions which are less intuitive and to which a user cannot relate to immediately For the current analysis we have used two fuzzy partitions for all numerical attributes throughout all the datasets. As described in section 5.C, the time complexity of FACISME is quite high, because of which the time required to train a fuzzy classifier using FACISME is also high. Hence, we have used two fuzzy partitions so as to limit the training time. But, even with just two fuzzy partitions we have achieved quite high accuracies, as described above. More importantly, even with this, we achieved similar \(sometimes better results\s other state-of-the art classifiers used in this experimental analysis. The reason for these high accuracies is that FACISME is based on the theoretically sound and well-established maximum entropy framework  VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have proposed a new classifier based on the paradigms of association rules mining and fuzzy logic  Though recent classifiers i nvolving association rules have shown their techniques to be accurate, their approaches to build a classifier either manifest unobserved statistical relationships in the dataset, or have no statistical basis at all FACISME uses the well-known maximum entropy principle and iterative scaling to build a statistical and robust theoretical model for classification Fuzzy Logic gives FACISME the capability to deal accurately and efficiently  with any type of datasets and domains, and in any kind of environments, which is not necessarily true for traditional crisp classifiers. Thus, using maximum entropy and fuzzy logic, FACISME provides very  good  accuracy and can work with all types of data irrespective of size and type of attributes \226 numerical or binary  REFERENCES 1  Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R.: Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
