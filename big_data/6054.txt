Construction of High-quality Feature Extension Mode Library for Chinese Short-text Classification  Xinghua Fan College of Computer Science and Technology Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications Chongqing 400065, China fanxh@cqupt.edu.cn Hongge Hu College of Computer Science and Technology Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications Chongqing 400065, China huge120806@163.com  AbstractOne feasible way to handle the difficulties in the Chinese short-text classification is doing feature extension for its content. And a key technique of it is the construction of feature extension mode library whose quality would directly influence the effect of feature extension. This paper proposes a method of constructing a high-quality feature extension mode library. In our method, firstly, we obtained the feature extension modes from the training set, and then introduced three measures, i.e., confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength of the obtained feature extension mode, to improve their quality. Finally, we used the high-quality feature extension modes to construct a high-quality feature extension mode library. Experimental results show that \(1 the three measures can improve the quality of feature extension mode in some degree respectively; \(2 feature extension mode library is helpful to improving the effect of Chinese short-text classification Keywords-Chinese short-text classification; high-quality feature extension mode library; confidence; category homoplasy relevancy strength I. INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of information technology the form of information transmission has been being endlessly enriched. As the major representative form of information such as SMS, online charting and Netizen comments, short-text, which generally has no more than 160b, becomes the important channel for the dissemination of public information. But taking the short-text as the carrier 


propagation of all kinds of pornography, violence, rumor reactionary remarks, fraud and illegal advertising in network will inevitably become the hidden trouble of social stability with the fast explosive growth of short-text. So we must effectively monitor, intercept and filter the harmful information related to that. Short-text classification technology [1-4], which delivers the short-texts to some predefined classes based on the content analysis, is a kind of effective way accounting for above mentioned problems Owing to the fact that the short-text has inherent defects such as short length, weak signal and high ambiguity, the short-text categorization is a very challenging task. So far one feasible way to handle the difficulties in the short-text classification is making use of some extra information [3-4 to assist classification. The method of introducing extra information is doing feature extension for short-text by excavating the hidden information itself. The goal of introducing extra information is to enhance the quantity of short-texts content or make up its inherent defects As important extra information, the co-occurrence relationships among terms are helpful for short-text classification [4]. The process such as in [4], which introduced simple co-occurrence relationships and didnt consider their quality, may bring noise into texts, and lead that it is difficult to get a satisfied classification result. While we call the collection of co-occurrence relationships among terms for short-text classification as feature extension mode library, it is obvious that, the core issue of improving classification performance is to build a high quality feature extension mode library. This needs to solve the following problems. \(1 feature extension mode, i.e., a co-occurrence relationship, is high quality or not? \(2 extract high quality feature extension modes According to the two problems above, the main work of this paper are as follows: \(1 homoplasy, which could effectively describe category distribution or category tendency of a feature extension mode is proposed to consider the quality of a feature extension mode; \(2 which could effectively describe the relevance between terms which represent a feature extension mode, is proposed 


to measure the validity of the information of a feature extension mode; \(3 quality feature extension mode library is presented by introducing confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength which can improve the quality of feature extension modes effectively into the constructing process of it. The method, which starts with mining the co-occurrence relationships hidden in the training set which are the source of the feature extension mode library, ensures the validity of extra information for short-text classification II. ANALYSIS FOR MAIN PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTIN OF MAIN PROBLEMS A. Analysis for Main Problems As paper [4], we consider the words which are co2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering 978-0-7695-4080-1/10 $26.00  2010 IEEE DOI 10.1109/ICIE.2010.117 87 occurrence more than a certain percentage of the training set are interrelated. And obtain the co-occurrence relationships hidden in training set by association rules mining [5-6 In order to ensure that the feature extension modes can be covered all categories in training set, there are two ways that we can adopt. One way is that we obtain the feature extension modes from each category respectively and then combine them for the final feature extension mode library The other way is that we obtain the feature extension modes overall and the feature extension mode library. For the first way, there exits a problem: some feature extension modes may appear in multiple categories, which leads that feature extension modes do not have strong category distinguish ability and have low quality. For example, the mode Netizen=>comment category but also in News category. When we read ?? in the texts of Reading category , the word ??will be extended into the texts according to our extension strategy. If so, it will add category fuzzy to the classified texts after doing feature extension. As to the second way, there exits such a problem that terms, which represented a feature extension mode, do not appear in an identity category, and this also leads its low quality. Take the mode Afghanistan=>people 


have strong distinguish ability for News category, while the term ?? tends to Finance. After we extend the texts including the word??? in News, the word ?? will brings noise for the classified texts and affect its classification result. In this paper, we get the feature extension modes by the second way. And in order to avoid the problems above, we will give our solution in next part In addition, the feature extension modes obtained only signify that the terms represented a mode are in an identity text and dont consider the distance between them, however in the texts with both syntax and semantics, the terms which appear closely together always have stronger semantic relevancy than the terms at distance, and the terms with strong relevancy can carry much useful information for text classification. So if we choose the feature extension modes with strong semantics relevance or short path for the shorttexts, we will get a perfect feature extension result for its classification. But how do we obtain the effective information?  The next part includes our solution B. The Solution of Main Problems z The Establishment of Category Homoplasy Studying the theory of association rule mining, we know that the more frequently a term appears in the affairs, the more possible the item-sets including it are frequent. But for text classification, the terms with high frequency will always appear in multiple categories and be evenly distributed. That is to say their category tendency ability is small, or their contributions to classification are small. So we usually do some pre-processing to remove the high-frequency but meaningless terms. Now, if we extend the terms with small category distinguish ability into the texts, they will bring noise into the text, and affect the classification result In addition, if the category tendency of terms represented a feature extension mode are inconsistent, it will also bring noise into the texts. So we need the feature extension modes which not only appear in an identity category but also have a strong distinguish ability for the identity category. According to the request above, we definite the concrete forms next    1 Here counti\(A 1 of term A in category i, while count\(A number of occurrence of A in the training set. Category 


Distribution Disi\(A occurrence frequency in some category, such as category i    2 Here max term A while sec and i?j. And Trendi\(A to category i. From the formula \(2 distributed, it will have a weak category tendency; else it has a strong category tendency Definition3. \(Category Homoplasy extension mode A=>B, calculate the Trendi\(A B If there exits i=j and that Trendi\(A B larger than zero, then we say that the feature extension mode A=>B have Category Homoplasy The intuition of this definition is as follows: Category Homoplasy is determined by the category tendency of the terms represented a feature extension mode. If there exits i?j the feature extension mode has no Category Homoplasy. If there exits i=j, but that one or all of the terms has zero category tendency, the feature extension mode also has no Category Homoplasy The measure of Category Homoplasy ensures that the terms represented a feature extension mode are inclined to an identity category, besides, all of them have strong category tendency. So we can say that the feature extension modes which satisfy a given threshold of Category Homoplasy have effective information. However, the terms represented a feature extension mode have different category distribution though they are inclined to an identity category. That may lead to the thresholds of Category Homoplasy different z The Establishment of Relevancy Strength Based on association rule mining method, they follow the assumption that the higher co-occurrence frequency the terms have, the stronger relevancy strength they have. But there has a problem like that the co-occurring relationship that appear closely together is considered in the same way as that co-occurring relationship at distance. For example, the mode  ? ? => ??  \(data=>mining frequency of occurrence as ??=>?? \(grieve=>country would be considered to have the same relevancy strength In fact, the former have stronger relevancy strength than the latter, though their frequencies of co-occurrence are same 


In fact, the co-occurrence frequency and relevancy strength are two different types of information. Some high frequent co-occurrences may have weak relevancy strength 88 Now how can we determine and measure the relevancy strength for a co-occurrence relationship? Here, we can call co-occurrences relationship link [7], and give our answer by means of link distribution    3 Here posd\(a 3 documentd . And consist of two terms a andb which occur in a given window x  in documentd   dFre x L a ba b d x= ?                             \(4 Here | . |  in \(4 set, and Frea,b\(x It is the total number of the unordered term pair consists of two terms a and b which co-occurs in a given window x. It is also called the frequency of link ab when the window size is x, or it is called link distribution intuitively    5 The Cumulative link distribution function CDFa,b\(x represents the proportion of term pairs of a and b that have distance less than or equal tox Link distribution Fre\(x changing with the size of given window. We will find that cumulative link distribution function of Fre\(x corresponding relation with relevancy strength. It should be considered that the higher the proportion of term pairs having small distance, the stronger relevancy strength between terms is. The way of introducing CDF\(x bringing the mode with weak relevancy strength into the feature extension mode library. According to the training data, the distributions of CDF\(x x extension modes, which are randomly selected Bayerische-Motoren-Werke\(BMW BMW=>Red-Flag It can be seen that CDF\(x strength of links, i.e., the CDF\(x more than that of ??=>?? \(0.8>0.7727 while x=10 0.9333 >0.8636 while x =20, 1>0.9545 while x =30

As for the parameter, window size x is not sensitive; and it can be from 10 to 30 according to our training set. In this paper, x  is 20 III. OUR CONSTRUCTION APPROACH OF HIGH-QUALITY FEATURE EXTENSION MODE LIBRARY The process of constructing a high-quality feature extension mode library is described as follows Step 1 Doing Pre-processing for Data First, filter the texts of the training set according to the list of Chinese stop words. Then consider every filtered text as an affair and every concept word as a term Step 2 Doing Association Rules Mining Give a minimum support and a minimum confidence threshold, and then excavate the association rules of terms hidden in training set through Fp-Growth algorithm Step 3 Checking up the feature words Check up the association rules according our feature set having selected only leaving the association rules whose former part is not in the feature-set and the latter is Step 4 Using Category Homoplasy Constraint Scan the training set again to get category tendency of the terms represented every feature association rule from step 3, and then give the minimum homoplasy thresholds to get the feature association rules whose terms are not only have an identity category but also have strong category tendency Step 5 Using Relevancy Strength Constraint Scan the training set again to get the cumulative link distribution of every feature association rule from step 4 and give a minimum relevancy strength threshold to construct a 


high-quality feature extension mode library IV. EXPERIMENTS A. Experiments dataset The dataset is composed of six categories including finance, reading, news, military, technology, and automobile Each category is composed of 18000 Chinese short-texts. We averagely divided texts of each category into four parts randomly, one part as testing data, the rest as training data B. Experimental Design In our experiments, the feature extension strategy is raising the weight of feature terms that represent the latter part of association rule according to its former terms. We choose SVM as our text classifier For the sake of checking the influences of feature extension mode library with different quality degree on the short-text classification, we construct five feature extension mode libraries with different measures as TABALE TABLE II.

Experimental results We use the following measures in the evaluation of classification: Precision \(P R F1 The experimental results are shown in TABLE D. Experimental Analysis Comparing the results of non extended and extended with I1, we know that the co-occurrence relationships can be taken as useful extra information to help short-text classification The results of extended with I1, extended with I2 extended with I3 and extended with I4 show that confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength can improve the quality of feature extension mode respectively. Especially category homoplasy it can make short-text classification result to the best Table. ? indicates that the feature extension mode libraries with different quality play different roles for short-text classification. With the improvement of the quality of feature extension mode library, the role of extension for short-text concept is enhancing or the classification result is improving on the whole We can also see that the degree of improvement is small; even there is decline, such as finance and automobile. By analyst, there are some reasons as follows\(1 modes in the feature extension mode library is too few, leading that the information coverage in it is limited and the extension chance for term is small 2 accurate enough and could bring some noise into texts by extension; \(3 text also have an influence on its classification result 4 suitable for Chinese short-text classification V. CONCLUSION In this paper, we study how to construct a high-quality feature extension mode library for short-text classification 


And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response.

VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
