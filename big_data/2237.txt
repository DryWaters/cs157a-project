the decomposition path, using the \nprimitive dataflow patterns. In SciFlow the underlying \nscientific application automatically inherits the features of \nMapReduce such as fault-tolerance, implicit parallelism and \nload balancing. To process the computational results we can \nconstruct a data analysis pipeline using data processing \npatterns and apply it after the corresponding computational \nflow.  \nB. Model Architecture nThe SciFlow model architecture provides a deployment, \nexecution and management environment for scientific ncomputing applications. It has a four-layered architecture \nusing MapReduce as the interpretation interface to a Hadoop \nplatform. Fig. 3 illustrates the four-layered framework \ndesign. The top layer, the Dataflow layer, is a SciFlow \napplication built in three logical components: \n• Dataflow DAG is a high-level implementation of a \nscientific workflow created by assembling a series of \ndataflow patterns with the underlying scientific \napplications. \n• Controllers are used to control user-specified \nperformance and resource constraints by passing \napplication native parameters to the underlying \napplication wrapper dynamically setting parallel \ngranularity based on the runtime environment and \nadjusting the workload submitted to the Hadoop \ncluster.  \n• Resource Manager tracks data sources and data \nsinks for each of the data flows, reserves new \nsources and sinks for each new flow, and works with \nthe iteration pattern to create a new data source and \ndata sink for the upcoming sub-dataflow. In addition, \nthe management of data serialization for each of \nflows can also be implemented in this component.  \nThe dataflow-driven design patterns simplify the \nprogramming complexity for task-parallel applications on \nlarge-scale distributed systems and provide a natural way to \nmatch its original workflow description. The dataflow-based nimplementation has a very high reusability for adding new \nfeatures or recomposing as a sub-dataflow in the new \ndevelopment. The parallelism allows ordinary applications \nto be composed into MapReduce jobs that can scale to the \ndistributed computing environment with its additional \ninherent fault-tolerance feature.  \nIn the second tier, the Hadoop platform is used as the \ndataflow execution engine to support, manage and serve ndata-intensive MTC. It uses MapReduce to express a high-\nlevel, dataflow-based implementation while hiding explicit \nparallel operations and communication patterns. The file \nsystem of the Hadoop environment, the Hadoop Distributed \nFile System \(HDFS cluster. The design of \nHDFS provides important fundamental guarantees, such as \nreliability, scalability availability and performance to \nsupport its upper parallel data processing model from the file \nsystem’s perspective. \nHadoop Streaming, the third tier, is a standard utility in \nthe Hadoop distribution, and is used to support integration \nbetween Hadoop and external applications. In this tier, \nscientific applications are scheduled to their corresponding \ncomputing nodes and are executed from the localized task \ndirectory that is created by the Hadoop runtime system. \nSince the localized task directory is a POSIX-like file \nFigure 3 SciFlow model architecture and its components. \n38\nsystem, there is no need to modify the applications to adapt \nto the HDFS file system. To exchange information between \nHadoop runtime system and the localized system on which \nexternal applications run, a wrapper script is used to stage \ninput and output files as well as redirect or rewrite system \nstdin and stdout on each of the computing nodes. For \nscientific applications that do not support output with the \nstdout command, we can either parse its output file in the \nwrapper or inject its source code to get the required outputs.   \nThe bottom layer, or the fourth tier, of the SciFlow nmodel architecture is Hadoop-compatible hardware \ninfrastructure. This may be, for example, a Hadoop cluster nprovisioned locally on a campus, or a Hadoop resource \navailable through a cloud provider such as Amazon EC2 nThe parallelization of SciFlow is achieved by implicit \nmultiple levels of parallelism: job-level parallelism comes \nfrom the execution of independent MapReduce jobs; task-\nlevel parallelism comes from running the application using \nthe Map-only pattern driven by the Hadoop Streaming job; \ndata-level parallelism comes from the fine-grained \ngranularity in data block replicas in HDFS; and hardware-\nlevel parallelism is possible by using the accelerators and \nmultiple cores. The SciFlow automatically parallelizes the \nscientific applications in each machine using all available \ncores running as a data-intensive many-task application.  \nC. Application Deployment and Execution \nA SciFlow application can be deployed on any ncomputing environment that is compatible with Hadoop \nMapReduce. To start a scientific computing application the \nuser only needs to package the implementation \(Java class \nfile dependencies \n\(such as binary scientific programs, runtime libraries, and \napplication configuration files into two JAR files, and \nupload them to the Hadoop runtime system \(HDFS file \nsystem scientific computing \napplication is interpreted as separate MapReduce jobs which \nare assigned to JobTracker with a DAG arrangement. \nJobTracker breaks MapReduce jobs into the map tasks and \nreduce tasks in parallel and distributes them over the entire \ncluster by allocating tasks to TaskTracker on the worker \nmachines. Before executing a task, TaskTracker extracts the \ncorresponding job JAR from MapReduce workflow and \ncopies it to 


the local filesystem. The application \ndependencies are also copied from the Distributed Cache to \nthe current task work directory on the local disk. After that, \nan instance of TaskRunner is created to launch run the task. \nWhen a task is completed, the Hadoop runtime system \nautomatically recycles related local resources including \nintermediate files and directories. \nIII. CASE STUDY – LARGE SCALE RARE EVENTS \nSIMULATION nSimulating rare events in detailed atomistic molecular \nsimulations to obtain statistically relevant number of \ntransition trajectories is often computationally prohibitive. \nFFS [9] provides a promising route to sample rare events in \nequilibrium and non-equilibrium systems, but can become \ncomputationally challenging for sophisticated models with \ncomplex free-energy landscapes when optimized interface \nplacement is not straightforward. Examples of rare events \ninclude nucleation-driven phase transitions \(e.g., ice \nnucleation genetic switch flipping, and \(lattice  trajectories \nfrom an initial to a final state by propagating smaller \ntrajectories through a series of interfaces between the initial \nand final states as shown in Fig. 4. The initial and final states \nand the interfaces are distinguished based on the values of an \norder parameter. The order parameter represents a physical \nquantity that distinguishes between the initial and final states \nof the system. For example, in a liquid water-to-ice \ntransition, the order parameter could be the number of ice-\nlike water molecules.  \n \nIn our study, we focus on liquid-to-solid transitions in \nwater-methane solutions using an atomistically detailed nmodel for water \(TIP4P/Ice  solid \ncrystalline structures called hydrates. We use the sum of the \nnumber of water molecules in the three largest solid-like \nclusters as our order parameter. Solid-like water molecules \nare those that have structures consistent with those found in \nice and hydrate structure. A cluster includes all solid-like \nwater molecules that are within a specified cut-off distance \nof each other \(we use a value of 0.3 nm as our cut-off ndistance  system is \nexpected to have a complex energy landscape and therefore, \nsampling liquid-to-solid transition has proven to be rather \nchallenging, even with FFS. We have correspondingly \nmodified the original method. For example, we incorporated \nautomatic placement of interfaces during execution instead \nof deciding the interfaces a priori as suggested in the \noriginal algorithm. It is also noteworthy here that the studies \nmade possible here with SciFlow were impossible to \nachieve through the previous bash-script based \nimplementation nA. Big Data Challenges for FFS Simulation \nThe execution of the FFS application creates hundreds \nof thousands of output files and many terabytes of data. \nManaging these data and the analysis of the resulting rare \n \nFigure 4. A schematic view of forward flux sampling method [9]. \n39\nevents over the massive simulation data sets requires \ninfrastructure-level support for the application. In addition, \nthe FFS implementation presents a variety of configuration, \nruntime, data management, and task management challenges \nwhen run at scale. Program exceptions or system failures \ncan introduce statistical errors and can result in incorrect nresults. The guaranteed computation of millions of MD \nsimulation tasks needs a reliable data processing and ncomputing infrastructure. Our execution of the FFS \nsimulations at the scale of thousands CPU cores generates a \nhigh data velocity, significant aggregate I/O and task \nthroughput, and a very large \(TBs the \nunderlying distributed computing system.  \nB. FFS Implementation by Using Dataflow-driven Design nPatterns \nThe modified FFS algorithm and its implementation \nusing the concept of dataflow-driven design are shown in \nAlgorithm 1. There are three pairs of Map-only and Reduce \ndataflow patterns \(shown in yellow represent the \nunderlying concurrent MD simulations and the conversion \nbetween trajectory files and molecular structure files. In our \ncurrent design, we use GROMACS [17], a freely available \nMD simulation software for our simulations. We use \nCascading [18] APIs and the Gradle building environment to \nimplement the primitive dataflow patterns. The \nimplementations of these computational flows are mapped to \nthe underlying Hadoop MapReduce jobs by using dataflow \npattern API calls. For example, the following statement \nimplements the short MD simulations \(first yellow area, \nLines    in Algorithm 1 new MapOnlyAndReducePattern\(flowName,        // flow name \n                "perl cachedir_jar/runMD.pl mapper \n                "cat",                         // reducer \n runMDConfigShortPath,                     // source data  \n                runMDResultShortPath sink data \nLines     in Algorithm 1 count the cluster size \nfrom the output of the first MD simulation, and then \ncalculate the value of the next interface  . This is \nimplemented using the standard Count operation in \nCascading and the Pipeline pattern defined in SciFlow. \nLine 14 in Algorithm 1 identifies the trajectories that \ncross the next interface by comparing their cluster size and \nthe next . We decompose and correspond this statement to \ntwo primitive dataflow patterns: \nFlow joinFlow nnew JoinPattern\(lambdaFlow,    // dataflow contains  value  \n"ffs_id, lambda_value

In the next step, the \nSplit dataflow pattern identifies the crossed and incomplete \ntrajectories by comparing the cluster size with  and  \nvalues.  \nThe long MD simulation Lines    in Algorithm 1 pattern is used to combine the crossed \ntrajectories from the beyond, short and long MD simulation \ndataflows nFlow crossMergeFlow =                                      // merged flow \n new MergePattern\(crossShortFlow flow 1 \n crossLongFlow,                   // flow 2 \n crossBeyondFlow flow 3 \nWe use a similar approach to implement the remaining \nparts of the algorithm nIV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION \nA. Cluster Hardware and Software Configuration \nWe evaluate the performance of the SciFlow-based FFS \nimplementation using two different computing clusters. Our \nexperimental configuration uses the original Hadoop 1.1.2 \ndistribution from Apache. To improve JobTracker \nperformance for processing a large number of tasks, we \nincrease the concurrent task limitation in the capacity \nscheduler and enable out-of-band heartbeats in mapred-\nsite.xml.

Each CPU core of Cluster-B has roughly two \ntimes the flops performance of a CPU core of Cluster-A. \nThe nodes in both clusters have a single local disk, which is \na common configuration in a commodity cluster computing \nenvironment.  \nCluster-A is representative of a computing environment \non a cloud or grid with cost-effective processors and a \nslower interconnection Cluster-B is representative of a \ncampus high-performance cluster environment with a \ndedicated scientific computing environment and network. \nEvaluation on these two hardware configurations allows the \nexploration of the impact of various cluster configurations \nto the performance of the SciFlow-based FFS \nimplementation. \n nB. Baseline Performance Benchmark \nThe baseline performance measures the maximum \naggregate task and I/O throughput provided by the two \nclusters, which are two key factors that affect the \nperformance of dataflow patterns and scientific computing \napplications. Fig. 5 provides the detailed performance \nmatrices on Hadoop clusters along a range of number of \nmachines. \nTask Throughput: To measure maximum possible task \nthroughput rate reached on Hadoop platform, we run an \n“empty-workload” Hadoop Streaming job on variety of \nscales on both clusters. The input file for each benchmark is \na list of empty strings with a size of 20 times the count of \nmap slots times the count of machines. The total number of \nmap tasks for Hadoop Streaming job is set to the same as \nthe list size. The mapper executes sleep\(0 of task throughput \nby using total number of map tasks divided by the running \ntime of the map phase. \nI/O Throughput: We obtain aggregate read and write \nI/O performance by using TestDFSIO from the Hadoop ndistribution. TestDFSIO is a distributed I/O benchmark \nprogram that produces a separate map task to read or write \nfiles on each of DataNodes in parallel. To minimize the \neffect of filesystem buffers for the benchmark, we let each \nmap task write and read 20 times on 20 separate files. The \naggregate I/O throughput is calculated by using the total \nnumber of map tasks multiplied with the average throughput \nreported by TestDFSIO. The measurement results of the \nbenchmark characterize the baseline of two clusters and \nprovide a performance reference. Cluster-A has better \naggregate write performance than Cluster-B due to the large nnumber of whole computers and more local hard disks. \nConcurrently writing many files to the local disks is a nbottleneck of Cluster B. However, the high bandwidth and \nthe low latency of the InfiniBand network in 


Cluster-B give \nhigher aggregate read throughput and task throughput as the \ncount of cores increases. The switch backplane capacity and \nCPU performance of Cluster-A is a major bottleneck and \nlimits its aggregate read throughput and task throughput. \nC. Performance Evaluation for FFS Implementation \nTo better understand the scaling and performance \nbehaviors of SciFlow applications, we test the FFS \nimplementation on both clusters with a range of counts of \nTABLE I.

We perform the calculations using the \nexperimental environments using the same compiled FFS \nprogram and a fixed problem size as input. We measure the \ntotal execution time and analyze the average computational \nresources used in processing the first interface of the FFS \nsimulation to compare the two clusters. Since the number of \ncores in the biggest cluster is an order of magnitude larger \nthan the smallest one, we define a large enough problem size \nto generate sufficient workload on each testing set. For our \nperformance testing, we use 32 starting configurations as the \ninput corresponding to the red circles in Fig. 4 I/O \ntraffic besides the MapReduce program \(i.e., from \nGROMACS nStreaming job to capture and count all possible read and \nwrite operations on HDFS or the local file system nThe performance model of the FFS implementation is \ncharacterized by execution time, average task throughput and \naverage aggregate I/O throughput. To get precise \nmeasurements, all performance-related measurements are ncalculated after the FFS runtime by analyzing the Hadoop \njob history log, minimizing the measurement overhead to the \nSciFlow application.  \nFig. 6 provides the experimental results of the FFS \nimplementation on different scales. Somewhat surprisingly, \nthe total execution time decreases almost linearly as the \nnumber of CPU cores is increased. The FFS implementation \nbased on dataflow-driven design patterns using SciFlow is nvery efficient. We do not find any obvious overhead at the \ncurrent testing scale. For example, the FFS runtime \nenvironment over 1024 CPU cores requires average 13.78 \ntask/s throughput and produces average 195.13MB/s \naggregate I/O throughput on Cluster-A, and 25.86 task/s and \n366.25 MB/s on Cluster-B. It is easy to see that the average \ntask and I/O throughputs of FFS simulation are met by the \nperformance capacity of the Map-only pattern, as shown in \nour previous baseline benchmark in Fig. 5. \nTo explore the future peak performance requirements \nintroduced by SciFlow applications, we profile the FFS \nimplementation along the three performance factors. Fig. 7 \nshows the performance profiling results from the FFS \nsimulation for the first five interfaces over 1024 CPU cores \non Cluster-B. We find that the basic performance pattern of \nFFS simulation is the interaction between task throughput \nand I/O throughput. In this experiment, the simulation starts \nfrom a list of inputs, including 47 configurations, and \ngenerates 256 GROMACS simulation tasks for each of the \ninput. A very large number of MD simulations are executed. \nThese are distributed using the Map-only pattern over the \nwhole cluster. The start and completion of each MD \nsimulation produces internal streaming data \(time series \ndata MD trajectory file the end of the computational flow, the \nReduce pattern collects and aggregates computational results \nfor the next data processing flow, which is a composition of \nthe Merge, Split and Join patterns. Because the size of the \ntime series data is not very large, we set up a granularity \ncontroller to assign a small number of mappers and reducers \nto handle those data sets. Finally, the short data processing \nphase gets configurations to continue new simulations in the \nnext interface.  \n \nBy studying the profile of the FFS application, we can nidentify its peak demand on the underlying hardware \nresource. Table II shows the timestamps of the five highest \nTask Rates along with their I/O throughputs. We find that a \nhigh task throughput always corresponds to high I/O \noperations.

RELATED WORK \nTwo decades ago, Beowulf clusters provided a cost \neffective high performance computational \(HPC combining a large number of commodity \ncomputing devices, and was widely adopted by both industry \nand academia [19, 20]. Beowulf cluster computing has been \nwidely adopted as a standard for high performance ncomputing, and many distributed software infrastructures \nhave been built to support provisioning, workflow 


nscheduling, and resource management on Beowulf clusters, \nsuch as Swift [21], CometCloud [22], Kepler [23 Taverna \n[24], Wings [25], Dryad [26] and more [27, 28]. However, \nnone of these software infrastructures have been as widely \nadopted as the Beowulf cluster hardware infrastructure [29]. \nWe discuss the workflow systems that are most closely \nrelated to our approach.  \nSwift [21] and the Karajan workflow engine [28] are a nperformance-oriented MTC workflow system designed for \ncomposing application programs into parallel applications \nusing a scripting language-based description. Swift allows \ncomputational scientists to assemble a complicated scientific \nworkflow and easily scale their own applications on large-\nscale distributed systems. To improve task processing \nperformance, the execution model, Turbine [30], is designed \nto replace Swift’s centralized evaluator by an asynchronous \ndistribution mechanism. There is no filesystem-level fault-\ntolerance in the current Swift system, which could cause \nsome problems in the handling of a large number of data sets. \nIn contrast, SciFlow leverages the built-in block replicas of \nHDFS to support very large numbers of tasks and \ncorresponding output files.  \nSkywriting and CIEL [31] use a master/worker ncomputation model in which a job is represented as a \ndynamic task graph. The programming language can ndescribe task-level parallelism with iterative and recursive \nsupport. However, CIEL cannot support the same level of \nhigh task throughput as SciFlow, which limits its scalability \nfor MTC applications.  \nCometCloud 22] emphasizes platform as a service \n\(PaaS on-demand federation of computing \ninfrastructures as well as the deployment and robust \nexecution of applications on these federated environments. \nCometCloud lacks high-level programming model to support \nthe incorporation of scientific applications. However, \nbecause the standard MapReduce is supported on nCometCloud, it should be straightforward to deploy and \nexecute SciFlow application over underlying infrastructure \nresources that may be managed by CometCloud. \nNebula and Dryad [26] are a very similar data-parallel \nsolution with Hadoop from Microsoft Research. They extend \nthe MapReduce programing model to a more relaxed \nprogramming model in which a user can specify an arbitrary \ncommunication DAG rather than a sequence of \nmap/shuffle/reduce operations. To our knowledge, neither \nNebula nor Dryad is being actively developed presently. \nThere are GUI and web portal based workflow systems, \nsuch as Kepler [23], Taverna [24 Galaxy [32] and Wings \n[25] that focus on the ease of use of a computational \npipeline. Their graphical representation and centralized \narchitecture can be inefficient or problematic when faced \nwith complex data-intensive MTC applications as compared \nto scripting-based workflow systems [28, 33]. \nA few scientific computing projects have explored the \nHadoop environment for combining computation with large-\nscale data analytics. Dede et al. [34] give a preliminary \nevaluation for representing patterns of scientific ensembles non Hadoop. In the paper, they analyze and discuss many of \nthe gaps and challenges in mapping common scientific \nensemble patterns to the MapReduce programming model.  \nThe Apache Oozie project [35] provides a production \nworkflow management system for Hadoop, which can also \nbe used to support MapReduce-based scientific workflow. \nMany cloud providers, HPC and grid computing services \nprovide direct support for MapReduce, enabling applications \nto be deployed on a variety of computational infrastructures. \nVI CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nWe have presented an approach and the SciFlow model \narchitecture for easily building parallel scientific computing \napplications through the use of dataflow-driven design \npatterns. In the SciFlow model architecture, we adopt the \nstandard Hadoop distribution as the core of its data nprocessing, which enables SciFlow applications to leverage \nthe data processing, analytics, and mining tools built into the \nHadoop stack. The dataflow-driven design patterns for \nSciFlow are based on a MapReduce programming model that \nhas been widely adopted by industry and academia.  \nOur approach allows applications to run on a high \nperformance-computing cluster without requiring knowledge \nof the underlying computing infrastructures. The SciFlow \nmodel architecture leverages Hadoop and its underlying \necosystem to automatically parallelize data processing, to \nmanage dataflow dependence, synchronization, and data nserialization and transfer across the whole cluster. The \ndesign principles of this framework emphasize simplicity, \nscalability and fault-tolerance. We implement a software \nlayer over advanced components from the Hadoop \nenvironment and leverage the extensive services of the \nHadoop software stack. We validate the implementation and \nstudy its performance via a case study of a rare events \nsimulation application using FFS nThe SciFlow model architecture opens doors for further \nexploration in this area. In future work, we plan to port \nseveral data-intensive MTC applications to SciFlow. We also \nplan to further explore and characterize the behaviors of the \nSciFlow performance in areas such as scalability, fault-\ntolerance, and load balancing and using various hardware \naccelerators \(e.g., MIC, GPU e.g., cloud, grid n43\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis research is sponsored in part by NSF awards CNS-\n1228312 and OCI-1212680, and used HPC resources of the \nClemson Computing and Information Technology.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
