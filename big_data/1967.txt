A structured process to screen acquisition targets using both, financial and nonfinancial data and a developed prototype DSS to support the screening process are presented   1. Introduction  This paper discusses the screening of corporate acquisition targets from the point of view of the acquiring company. Screening is a part of the broadly defined acquisition due diligence process Tsao defines the broad mergers &amp; acquisitions M&amp;A potential candidates, evaluating the candidates, and assisting the after-transaction integration? [1]. The screening of potential targets that this paper discusses, is made as an early part of the process after the search for potential acquisition candidates market analysis candidate evaluation. The screening discussed, serves as a tool to select target companies for a more detailed due diligence \(or direct deal performed in-house by the acquiring company, based on available public and in-house information about the possible target companies, and on acquiring company experience and possible non-public information about the targets The motivation for the structured information acquisition and analysis and the decision support system \(DSS prepare the acquirer better to select targets for due diligence \(that entails costs acquisition. The structured way of screening presented in this paper keeps a trail of the screening process and avoids the problems of ?black-box decision-making, i.e., market data and expert knowledge about markets and companies is handled systematically, one factor at a time. It is our experience that even large companies often do not have structured systems to support their analysis of acquisitions, it is on this background we must view the benefits of a system that gives the analysis of acquisitions a well defined structure  Corporate acquisitions are a common and a popular form of corporate development. Even if acquisitions are very common, research results on their effect on company profitability and performance are mixed, and there is, e.g., no clear wisdom on wealth transfers between the acquiring and target company shareholders [2-4]. It seems that when done under the right circumstances and executed well 


under the right circumstances and executed well acquisitions can be highly profitable and win-win for shareholders of both the acquiring and the target companies. This is why screening tools that support screening and the understanding of target value better will most likely result in better M&amp;A results Most of the literature on M&amp;A is based on data from publicly traded companies. The major difference between public and private companies is the availability of information. For non-public companies information is usually not commonly available, and screening for acquisition has to be based on the information that is publicly available and on the expert knowledge of the acquiring company analysts and managers involved in the screening process. This means that gathering information for non-public companies is more difficult and requires more detailed data collection procedures \(public company data collection is a subset? of non-public company data collection The background for this research is cooperation with managers from a multinational company, who are actively involved in screening and executing acquisitions of mostly non-public companies When doing a pre-acquisition analysis of target companies, both, non-financial \(often qualitative quantitative Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE required. This approach is used in academic literature, see, e.g., [5, 6], as well as, in practiceoriented literature, e.g., [7, 8]. However, it seems to be a common approach to handle these data in a more or less unstructured way. Academics seem to discuss the factors important to corporate acquisitions in quite a conceptual, non-practice-oriented level Practice-oriented books obviously take a more pragmatic view. However, practicality may mean focusing on quantitative data and handling potentially relevant qualitative factors through simple checklists. Examples of the practicality handling quantitative data are decision support systems focusing on company financial ratios \(i.e., they are comparable-based valuations discussed, e.g., in [9, 10]. Examples of structured handling of both quantitative and qualitative data are presented with support systems for M&amp;A purposes e.g., in [7]. The paper includes selected multi-criteria decision aid in assessing acquisitions in banking The DSS built in this research provides a simple multi-criteria analysis of a target company This is done through scoring the relevant characteristics related to each numerical input with three ?scenario? alternatives. In addition to the score value, a relevance value of characteristics is required While the score describes the current, or future status of the particular characteristic, the relevance describes characteristic?s relevance on the current or future numerical input. The multi-criteria analysis is in place to support the cash-flow-based analyses generated by using the numerical inputs, i.e., the qualitative information is collected to form a better picture of reality that will guide the managers to understand the rationale behind the numbers. The users of the screening DSS are to go through and think about the relevant qualitative factors behind each numerical input. The aim is to make the following cash flow based valuation transparent and structured. The decision to start a due diligence process or further down the line, to acquire is based 


process or further down the line, to acquire is based on the profitability of the action ? the qualitative information \(e.g., generated weighted sums of qualitative factor values information The DSS requires further information, when the system recognizes inconsistency, either between qualitative and quantitative inputs, or between different quantitative inputs. Quantitative inputs are also checked against pre-determined check- values based on historical information about acquisition outcomes This paper continues by presenting shortly the background situation and challenges for the acquisition screening, followed by a description of the prototype system built, adhering to the structure of the system: inputs &amp; analysis of the stand-alone situation of the target \(i.e., the situation, where the target is assumed to operate alone as a separate company without acquisition inputs &amp; analysis of acquisition synergies, and the outputs from the system.

Prototype System for Structured Assessment of Acquisition Targets  2.1 Background of the System  In a joint project with a team of managers from a multi-national company we have planned and realized a prototype DSS that helps the managers to screen non-public acquisition targets in a structured way. The company has not previously had a system to support acquisition screening; the analyses have been done according to a set of pre-established guidelines, case by case, independently by managers The system is based on the following set of assumptions: i relatively small companies \(relative to the size of the acquirer within an industry will not dramatically change due to the acquisition. ii 


to the acquisition. ii privately held companies \(limits the availability of data and makes comparables-based valuation difficult industry as the acquiring company, i.e., the acquirer has in-house knowledge and experience on the industry. iv before the screening, e.g., the purpose for the next acquisition is specified  The purpose of the prototype DSS is to support the screening and initial valuation of potential target companies and to help gather relevant information about targets Strategy level actions \(real options supporting information already in the screening phase and that are considered and valued in the prototype are presented in Figure 1. They include options to time the acquisition, to create synergies, to split and divest parts of business or assets at some point in the future [11]. The value of the strategic-level actions comes in addition to the stand-alone value of the target company. The system gathers inputs for standalone evaluation and for the options and presents a collection of outputs from these analyses The structure of the system is described in Figure 2. The stand-alone evaluation comprises of basic and detailed information about the target and its competitive position today and in the expected future the two upper left boxes information is also gathered. The system performs checks and requires explanations, when it recognizes inconsistently entered financial and non-financial data \(non-financial information about the target is Figure 2.

The DSS has similar checks built-in for synergy inputs All the financial inputs are required for three scenarios, for which cash-flow tables are generated center column of Fig. 2 optimal timing of the acquisition On the right side of Figure 2 main outputs from the system are shortly listed. The output has a summary part and a detailed part. Both parts have numerical and graphical presentations. Quantitative output is focused on cash flows and the valuation of the target for the acquirer with analysis of optimal timing of the acquisition ? these are often the most important decision supporting outputs from the system. The target value is also decomposed and ordered according to where the greatest value is coming from. Qualitative output is focused on risk factors in addition to the factors, where the greatest potential for value creation lies ? these are presented deeper understanding. Based on the checks inconsistent and suspiciously low and high inputs are presented with the given explanations. Also information that is missing is listed in the output The required financial and non-financial data entered into the system and the structured method to handle the data is described in the next section together with a more detailed presentation of the prototype  2.2 Inputs &amp; Analysis for the Target as a Stand-Alone Company  The first input into the prototype is the acquiring company?s business reason for the acquisition, i.e., the transaction rationale. The rationale may explain, .e.g., why certain aspects of the target are not ?positive?, but the acquisition is still interesting from the acquirer's perspective After the defined purpose of the acquisition the system requires information about selected nonfinancial \(mainly qualitative more general market/industry related characteristics to target-specific operational and fit characteristics which may be industry and acquirer specific selection is based on a literature review on important factors in acquisitions and their valuation and the expert knowledge of our industrial project partners The rationale behind the selection of qualitative DETAILED TARGET CHARACTERISTICS CATEGORY CRITERIA Factor relevance Bad case Base case  Good case MARKET SHARE FORECAST Characteristic 1 5 -1 Characteristic 2 5 4 Characteristic 3 3 -1

Future development Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 characteristics used in the system has two aspects firstly, they should cover such factors that often prove to be, so called ?deal-killers?, i.e., factors that potentially make the target uninteresting from the acquirer-perspective; secondly, they should cover the key drivers behind the financial data. The approach attempts to capture the connection between the qualitative and the quantitative, financial and nonfinancial factors. Particularly, the prototype tries to systematically consider connected non-financial and financial inputs Stand-alone inputs include a wide variety of characteristics. In our DSS they are divided into two sets of categories  Historical and current information? includes evaluation of transaction rationale and the following categories: sector attractiveness and target competitiveness, strategic rationale, general uncertainty, non-core business, and last financial year. Each category has several criteria characteristics \(about five per category in our DSS Future development \(?Detailed target characteristics categories: market demand forecast \(possibly including cycle forecast \(the last two are seen in Figure 3 several characteristics are attached to each category  The next step for the user of the DSS is to assess the relevance of the stand-alone inputs; the relevance here means assessing how meaningful a factor is with respect to the financial input it is related to. We use linguistic, non-numerical scales ranging from ?no relevance? \(0 relevance? \(5 which doesn't require calculations at this point. The relevance of some characteristics may be assumed similar over all acquisition cases, while the relevance of others has to be considered case by case Relevance of factors should be revisited for different transaction rationales After the relevance is set for each factor assessment of  the current state of characteristics related to historical and current information is done We again use linguistic scales \(scores from optimal state \(3 3 while 0 means, e.g., the industry average. A special emphasis is placed on the identification of deal 


emphasis is placed on the identification of dealkillers \(e.g., a potential deal-killer is a characteristic with relevance of 5 and score of -3 The next step is to give \(monetary or percentage categories of above evaluated qualitative factors are attached. The numerical inputs are ordered roughly according to the following ?income statement structure  Total sales of the market x     Market share of the target company Sales of the target company x     EBIT margin \(i.e. less operative costs Earnings before interest and taxes Interest and taxes Profit  The numerical inputs start from market demand \(total sales earnings before interest and taxes continuing with acquisition target?s market share and EBIT margin to get target?s slice of the cake, i.e target?s sales, as well as, its EBIT. The DSS also requires last/current financial year's figures, which are required to match with given EBIT margin \(first type of consistency checks of the DSS include tax rate and discount rate \(according to weighted average cost of capital, WACC later in discounting future free cash flows The structure and order of the categories and criteria belonging to each category, is designed to make an expert think through the most relevant characteristics \(and their status figure before she enters one into the system. This, we believe is a benefit over a non-structured  information gathering. The same procedure applies  for historical and current financial inputs, as well as, for future development and synergy evaluation A screenshot of the future-development part of the DSS is seen in Figure 3. Qualitative characteristics are, similarly to the current and historical data, required for each category first market demand forecast \(not seen in Figure 3 market share forecast, and margin forecast. The expert needs to evaluate characteristics? relevance \(05 3 - +3 same above, but scores are defined differently: -3 refers to very large negative development from today to the future, while +3 refers to very favorable development, and 0 is to describe a development with no change from characteristic?s current state. These inputs are used to calculate a weighted average for the set of qualitative characteristics under each category. Weighted average is calculated as an average of score values of characteristics attached to each category \(or subcategory values as weights Secondly, quantitative inputs are required for each category: market demand forecast \(if an industry is cyclical, numerical inputs required to model a cycle include current state of cycle, length of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 cycle, amplitude of cycle, and trend growth rates market share forecasts \(numerical inputs include percentage market share, the time when the expected market will realize, and possible related costs margin forecast \(numerical inputs include margin and an estimated time when it will be realized, and possibly related  costs three scenarios: bad, base, and good case 


three scenarios: bad, base, and good case Future development information determines how the development continues from the current situation. The primary goal is to project cash-flow estimates for the next ten years \(and to generate an estimate for terminal value forecast explains future changes in market size and market share forecast changes in the future market share. The DSS estimates the target?s future sales from the input data. Margin forecast and tax-rate inputs allow calculating free cash flow scenarios The DSS requires the expert to explain if the numerical inputs are in contrast to what is indicated by the inputted qualitative characteristics weighted average, e.g., if the weighted average of the qualitative factors in market share category is negative and the expert enters a future market share larger than the current market share, the DSS requires an explanation \(second type of consistency checks of the DSS appropriate thresholds for checks. The system creates with time a database that can be valuable for further developed multi-criteria analyses The used simple averaging of qualitative data, used in the DSS to act as a general benchmark against which numerical inputs are compared and checked can be made more intelligent by researching further the relationship between the qualitative factors. It is important to note that the averages per se, are not a main decision support issue So far, we have described the analysis of the acquisition target as a stand-alone company However, an acquirer has options to create value through synergies. Analysis of synergies is described in the next section  2.3 Synergy Inputs &amp; Analysis  Potential targets need to be evaluated for fit and synergy factors. Fit of the target is a measure of how likely it is that the target can be successfully CATEGORY CRITERIA Factor relevance Bad case Base case Good case COST SYNERGY POTENTIAL Characteristic 1 3 3 Characteristic 2 4 1 Characteristic 3 5 3 Characteristic 4 2 2 Characteristic 5 1 3 Weighted average 2,33 Manufacturing cost synergies \(% of target's manufacturing cost Manufacturing cost synergies \(Euros Check: Manufacturing costs versus qualitative inputs OK: Synergies correspond to the weighted  average Costs to achieve the synergies 0 0 0 Time to achieve synergies 3 2 1 Characteristic 6 5 1 Characteristic 7 3 1 Characteristic 8 4 0 Characteristic 9 5 0 Characteristic 10 2 -1 Weighted average 0,32 Sourcing synergies \(% of target's sourcing cost Sourcing synergies \(Euros Check: Sourcing synergies versus qualitative inputs OK: Synergies correspond to the weighted  average Costs to achieve the synergies 0,1 0,1 0,1 Time to achieve synergies 3 3 1 DETAILED TARGET SYNERGY CHARACTERISTICS Figure 4.

If the fit proves to be  too low \(providing zero or even negative ?synergies any reason to proceed with due diligence. However this is determined case by case and depends on the transaction rationale. After qualitative fit factors related to strategic and organizational issues are inputted the inputs are given for the valuation of synergies Synergy benefits can come from the following sources: cost reductions, revenue increases and balance-sheet synergies. Figure 4 shows a screenshot of how the DSS handles cost synergies Selected qualitative characteristics, directly related to each \(sub relevance and scored and consistency is checked Checks are also made against experience-based thresholds for each monetary input Estimates for synergy benefits and costs are inputted for each subcategory and the expected time to realize the synergies is given. Inputs are required for all three scenarios \(bad, base, and good cases The upper part of Figure 4 shows manufacturing and sourcing related cost synergies. Monetary inputs are required for each cost class as percentages. Other cost reduction synergy subcategories include sales general, and administration \(S, G &amp; A and development \(R&amp;D required to achieve synergies are inputted in monetary units. Similar inputs are required for revenue synergies related to cross-selling increases and for revenue enhancing factors, such as enhanced sales of the target. In the DSS, the revenue and cost synergies are expected to remain constant after the full synergy is achieved Inputs for balance-sheet synergies are required directly as cash flow information with timing \(e.g., sales income from balance sheet items is estimated for a specific future year capital synergies are handled similarly to revenue and cost synergies. Finally, the discounted value of total synergies is added to the discounted stand-alone value of the target for all three scenarios; together these ?synergy added stand-alone value? scenarios are estimates of how much the target is worth to the acquirer, and acts as primary decision support for managers evaluating going further The next section takes a look at the outputs from the system  2.4 Outputs from the System  The first presented output is the valuation results based on cash flows, discounted to present value, i.e., NPV, analysis. Sensitivity analysis results are shown for variable discount rates. The cash-flow sheets of the system are in the form of income statement built in a way that stand-alone cash flows are separated from the synergies. A selection of financial ratios are also shown, e.g., revenue synergies / total revenues, cost synergies / total costs total net synergies / EBIT, and residual value / total net value. All outputs are available for the three scenarios together with a summary of the most significant value components for each scenario The value components include total market size \(Figure 5 and synergy development \(separately for each synergy subcategory 


synergy subcategory components are presented numerically and graphically Results on the analysis of the timing of the acquisition are presented. Figure 6 presents the effect of waiting on the value of the target. Figures are also presented for how much the acquisition price should decrease to postponing the acquisition profitable Qualitative data is presented for each category of historical, current, and future evaluations e.g., in the form of spider charts to notify a decision maker of risk factors and deal killers, as well as, the sources of the greatest potential. For each category the simple weighted averages are also presented. The results of the performed checks are also presented together with the given explanations for inconsistencies  3. Discussion and Conclusions  The paper has discussed the screening of potential acquisition targets from acquirer?s perspective and presented a decision support system to acquire relevant information, to assist in target evaluation, and to give decision support for the decision whether to proceed with a more profound due diligence process of the target or not Figure 5.

The presented DSS is likely to be useful also in the analysis of publicly listed companies for their cash-flow based substance The presented DSS integrates financial and non-financial \(roughly, quantitative and qualitative data in the analysis. By attaching most relevant qualitative characteristics to quantitative inputs, the system is able to check validity of given numbers When compared to the often found situation in the industry: companies not having a support system for acquisitions analysis, we believe the presented system offers a more well structured and transparent analysis, which will likely result in better decisionmaking The structure of the DSS attempts to force users to think through relevant factors behind each monetary/numerical input. Consistency is supported by built-in checks that require explanations, when out of line inputs are recognized The system takes into account strategic and operational fit, cash-flow based valuation, analysis for timing, synergies, and divestment of balance sheet assets. The lack of precision related to estimated future values is taken into account with a scenario approach by requiring inputs for three scenarios: bad base, and good case. This is in line with common practices in many modern companies The presented DSS needs further testing and performance analysis to support the possible future claims of superior performance and utility. The performance analysis is important for the assessing
