These factors explain the underwater channel’s\nessential difference from conventional terrestrial radio channels\nand complicate data transmissions in an underwater network.\nUnderwater networking technologies are in great demand, so\nnetwork protocols that ensure reliable underwater operations\nare of growing importance to the industry. The theory of\nnetwork coding promises significant benefits to increase channel\nthroughput and reduce data loss by transmitting encoded packets\ncontaining data from different source nodes.\nThis paper bridges theory with practice by implementing\nthe theory of network coding to increase the throughput of\nunderwater acoustic networks. There are presented experimental\nresults of network coding in shallow water with 5 nodes including\n2 end points and 3 access points.\nKeywords—underwater acoustic sensor networks, network cod-\ning acoustic communications\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNetworking technologies in underwater acoustics are\nbroadly discussed in scientific publications. The progress in\ndevelopment of such technologies is overviewed in 1]–[4].\nDevelopment of underwater acoustic networks is driven\nby increasing practical requirements on distance, reliability\nand bitrate of data exchange between multiple sources and\nrecipients, what represents a challenging task due to specifics\nof underwater acoustic environment. Underwater acoustic com-\nmunication between network nodes is strongly affected by\ninhomogeneity of the signal propagation environment vari-\nability of environmental parameters, multipath propagation of\nthe signals, movements of the network nodes along with other\nchallenges, common for acoustic communication [1].\nSuch properties of underwater acoustic channel imply a\ncommunication with non-guaranteed bit rate, bit error intensity,\ndistance and route of a data transmission in the network. The\nnumber of hops for data delivery between a source and a\nrecipient in an underwater acoustic network may not fixed,\nthe routing of data in the direction “source to recipient can\nbe different form the opposite direction “recipient to source”.\nDifferent approaches in the networking and even different\nimplementations of each network technology in such com-\nplicated environment can provide drastically different perfor-\nmance, low bit rate and reliability of data delivery.\nIn order to increase the efficiency of a underwater acoustic\nnetwork, especially operating in very complicated channels, the\nnetwork coding approach [5] can be applied. Implementing the\nnetwork coding the advantages can be performed by routing,\nallowing a node to carry out encoding operations and to\ngenerate output data by logical combination of its received\ndata. This is a novel transmission mechanism for decreasing\nof row data streams circulating in the network and increasing\nof effective bitrate and reliability of data transmission between\nthe source and recipient nodes.\nThe task of this paper is to demonstrate the increase of a\nunderwater acoustic network performance due to implementa-\ntion of the network coding technique in different environments:\nsimulating environment, pool and a shallow water channel.\nFor each of the environments the comparison of the network\nperformance with and without application of the network\ncoding is provided.\nII. NETWORK CODING BASICS\nIn this work, we focus on one specific type of network\ncoding, where we combine packets by means of the XOR\noperation for unicast flows.\nThe basic idea of network coding can be illustrated using\nthe Alice-and-Bob scenario in Fig. 1. \(The basic Alice-and-\nBob scenario wants to send packet P2 to Alice. They rely on a\nrelay in the middle to exchange packets.\nEach packet \(such as P1 and P2 packet.\nEncode at relay\(s refer as an\nXOR \(encoded s doing the XOR operation\nP2 = P2 XOR \(P1 XOR P2 P1 XOR \(P1 XOR P2 P1 and P2 to their intended receiver,\nthe access point only needs to transmit one packet instead of\ntwo 6].\nIII. PURPOSE OF USING NETWORK CODING IN\nUNDERWATER ACOUSTIC SENSOR NETWORKS\nIt is considered an underwater acoustic network with a\nmodified butterfly topology, consisting of numerous surface\nnodes, access points \(on the bottom the\nbidirectional links between each of the nodes were used. The\npurpose of such network topology is to enable delivery of\nmessages from the nodes on the surface to the nodes in water\ncolumn via the relays and vice versa 


Transmission distances\ncan be very large, so that the access points between the surface\nnodes and the underwater are required. In such networks,\naccess points are responsible for forwarding the packets to the\nend-nodes. Access points can only successively relay received\npackets, what limits the number of deliverable packets. So the\nsequential transmission becomes a big issue in networking and\nleads to a bottleneck problem at the access points.\nAccess points using network coding instead of simply\nrelaying the packets of information, combine several packets\nfor a transmission. This is useful to attain the maximum\npossible information flow in the network.\nButterfly topology [5] is used to illustrate how the network\ncoding can improve the network communication performance\nin multicast scenario.\nFig. 2 demonstrates the transmission scheme based on a\nFIFO queue. It is obvious that sending packets of P1 and P2\nsequences simultaneously is impossible \(one packet per time\nunit of\nmultiple packets per time unit is possible. This is illustrated in\nFig. 3. Thus the throughput of the network can be improved\nby means of implementation of the network coding.\nTo deliver two messages with the queue implementation\nfrom the surface node to the underwater node and vice versa,\nthree steps are needed \(one packet per one time unit network coding\n1 sending\npacket P2 to them;\n2 and which one at last\n\(sending P1 or P2 P1 or P2 are needed to deliver two packets\nthrough an access point, the achievable network throughput\nis 1.5 packets per time unit \(3 time units per 2 packets =\n1.5 packets per time unit network\ncoding, the delivery of two packages can be done in two steps,\nhence the network throughput can achieve 2 packets per time\nunit\(2 time units per 1 encoded packet = 2 packets per time\nunit RESULTS\nTo investigate the network throughput in a underwater\nacoustic channel, three different types of experiments were\nconducted and compared:\nFig. 4. Network topology used in experiments\n• Experiments by means of real-time emulator of Evo-\nLogics underwater acoustic modems [7]. The emulator\nallows creating several emulated EvoLogics modems,\nto place them in 3D space such as creating a desired\ntopology. The required distances for network coding\nexperiments have been reached.\n• Experiments in a pool \(2.5 x 2.3 x 3 m where\neach access point was 1 m away from any other\naccess point and from the \(source/recipient source/recipient nodes were placed in the pool\ntwo meters apart to each in locations, in which were\nnot able to directly deliver the packages \(low delivery\nsuccess rate water lake\n\(ultra shallow water: one to four meters an order of ten\ncentimeters a distance\nof 100 m.\nThe network topology used in all types of experiments is\nillustrated in Fig. 4. There were used 5 S2CR 18/34 EvoLogics\nmodems [8]:\n• two source/recipient nodes, which generated messages\nand sent them as non-encoded original packets;\n• three access points \(in network coding theory also\nknown as relays which encoded received packets and\nrelayed them as broadcast messages to all accessible\nmodems \(access points and nodes nodes was slightly over\n100 m.\nTransmitted packets in different test cases had lengths\n15 bytes, 30 bytes and uniformly distributed random values\nbetween 15 and 30 bytes.

Experimental results for 


network coding\nThe results of experimental comparison of these two ap-\nproaches are presented in the paper.\nOne of the indicators, used for evaluation of data delivery\nsuccess, was the experimental probability as the ratio between\ntransmitted and successfully received messages.\nFigures 5, 6 and 7 demonstrate the comparison of ex-\nperimental results using network coding and queue. Each\nexperiment shows that the probability of successfully deliv-\nered packets was higher when using network coding. These\nfigures also demonstrate the influence of the transmission\nrate onto experimental probability of packets delivery All\nfigures demonstrate increasing probability of packets delivery\nwith increasing transmission rate. With smaller transmission\nrates, specifically “between 2 and 5 seconds”, the queuing\nand network coding approaches provided similar results. The\ndifference \(improvement transmission rates, particularly be-\ntween 10 and 20 seconds the difference was already significant:\nranging between 0.2 and 0.3.\nFig. 8 demonstrates experimental results and comparison\nof the experimental probability using network coding for three\ndifferent types of experiments in different environments. When\ncomparing the relation between the probability and the random\ntransmission rate, the figures illustrate very similar results.\nFigures 9 and 10 show experimental results in the shallow\nunderwater acoustic channel. The experiments were carried\nout using the network coding for three different lengths of\npackages: 15 bytes, 30 bytes and random length between\n15 and 30 bytes. The figures demonstrate the influence of\nthe message length onto delivery success \(the probability of\nsuccessfully received messages the probability is lower\nin comparison to the probabilities for all other lengths. The\nmessage length of 15 bytes, as well as random length, are\nrelated to approximately equal probabilities.\nComparing the probabilities, specific for these message\nlengths when using queue, the relations prove to be quite sim-\nilar to those of the network coding \(Fig. 10 length,\n15 bytes, the network coding provides higher performance than\nthe approach using queue.\n2..5 5..10 5..15 10..20\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nExperim. results for network coding in shallow water:\nlength of message vs random transm. rate\nex\npe\nrim\nen\nta\nl p\nro\nba\nbi\nlit\ny\nrandom transmission rate in sec\n \n \nlength 15B\nlength 30B\nlength random\(15B?30B vs. random transmit. rate\n2..5 5..10 5..15 10..20\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nExperimantial results for FIFO queue in shallow water:\nlength of message vs random transmission rate\nex\npe\nrim\nen\nta\nl p\nro\nba\nbi\nlit\ny\nrandom transmission rate in sec\n \n \nlength 15B\nlength 30B\nlength random\(15B?30B FIFO Queue in shallow water: length of\nmessage vs. random transmit. rate\n2..5 5..10 5..15 10..20\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nExperimantial results for network coding in shallow water\nEnd?to?end delay vs random transmission rate \(src./rec 1 15B\nlength 30B\nrandom length\(15B?30B end-to-end\ndelay vs. random transmit. rate \(src./rec. 1 results for network coding  in shallow water\nEnd?to?end delay vs random transmission rate \(src./rec 2 length\n\(15B?30B random transmit. rate \(src./rec. 2 15b?30b coding in shallow water \nEnd?to?edn delay vs length of transmitted message\( 5 + random 5 sec d\nel\nay\n in\n se\nc\nlength of message in bytes\n \n \nsrc./rec.1\nsrc./rec.2\nFig. 13.

In these\ncircumstances data delivery delay between the source and the\nrecipient depended not only on the networking method, but\nalso on the length of the message.\nEnd-to-end delay needed for delivery of data packages from\nthe source to the recipient has been investigated.

Baseline Methods\nTo the best of our knowledge, no graph matching algorithm\nhas been designed for bipartite graphs. Throughout this section,\nwe compare our algorithms to 3 state-of-the-art approaches,\nwhich are succinctly described in Table II: \(i eigenvalue decomposition-based approach pro-\nposed by Umeyama [24]; \(ii Non-negative Matrix Factorization [10]; and \(iii and scalable Belief Propagation-based \(BP  the\nRelated Work \(Section VI we convert the latter to unipartite by using\nProposition 1. In addition to that, the BP-based approach\nrequires not only the two input graphs, but also a bipartite\ngraph that encodes the possible matchings per node. To render\nthe method applicable in our setting, we use two heuristics\nfor forming the required bipartite ‘matching’ graph: \(a no\ndomain information about the possible alignments, and each\nnode of the ?rst graph can be aligned with any node of\nthe second graph \(NetAlign-full b degree in both\ngraphs are considered possible matchings \(NetAlign-deg experiments on bipartite graphs, we use the movie-\ngenre graph of the MovieLens network3.

Then, following the tradition in\nthe literature [10], for each of the subgraphs we generate\npermutations, B, with noise from 0% to 20% using the\nformula Bij = \(PAQ 1 + noise rij  permutations of the initial subnetwork.\nWe run the alignment algorithms on all the pairs of the original\nand permuted subgraphs, and report the mean accuracy and\nruntime. For all the variants of BIG-ALIGN, we set the sparsity\npenalty ? = 0.1.\nHow do we compute the accuracy of the methods? For\nthe state-of-the-art methods which ?nd “hard” alignments\nbetween the nodes, the accuracy is computed as usual: only if\nthe true correspondence is found, the corresponding matching\nis deemed correct. In other words, we use the state-of-the-art\nalgorithms off-the-shelf. For our method, BIG-ALIGN, which\nhas the advantage of ?nding soft”, probabilistic alignments,\nwe consider two cases for evaluating its accuracy: \(i the true correspondence coincides with the most\nprobable matching, we count the node alignment as correct;\n\(ii tie of nodes\nin tie total # of nodes a b varying level\nof noise in the permutations. We observe that BIG-ALIGN\noutperforms all the other methods in most cases with a large\nmargin.

The results for other graph sizes are along\nthe same lines, and therefore are omitted for space.\nFigure 5\(a depicts the accuracy of the alignment methods\nfor varying graph size. For graphs with different sizes

The only exception is for the small-\nest graph size where the consecutive optimal steps change\nsigni?cantly \(Fig. 2\(a the performance. NetAlign-full and Umeyama’s\nalgorithm are the least accurate methods, while NMF-based\nand NetAlign-deg achieve medium accuracy.

Before we continue with the\nevaluation of UNI-ALIGN, we present in Table III the runtime\nand accuracy of all the variants of BIG-ALIGN for aligning\nmovie-genre graphs with varying sizes and permutations with\nnoise level 10%. The parameters used in this experiment\nare  = 10?5, and ? = 0.1. For BIG-ALIGN-Basic, ? is\nconstant and equal to 10?4, while the correspondence matrices\nare initialized uniformly. This is not the best setting for all\nthe pairs of graphs that we are aligning, and it results in\nvery low accuracy. On the other hand, BIG-ALIGN-Skip is\nnot only 350× faster than BIG-ALIGN-Points, but also\nmore accurate. Moreover, it is ? 2× faster than BIG-ALIGN-\nExact with higher or equal accuracy. The speedup can be\nfurther increased by skipping more updates of the gradient\ndescent steps. Overall, the results show that a naive solution\nof the optimization problem, such as BIG-ALIGN-Basic, is not\nsuf?cient, and the optimizations we propose in Section III are\ncrucial and render our algorithm ef?cient.\nC. Evaluation of UNI-ALIGN\nTo evaluate our proposed method, UNI-ALIGN, for aligning\nunipartite graphs, we use the Facebook who-links-to-whom\ngraph [25], which consists of approximately 64K nodes. In this\ncase, the baseline approaches are readily employed, while our\nmethod requires the conversion of the given unipartite graph\nto bipartite. We do so by extracting some unweighted egonet4\nfeatures for each node \(degree of node, degree of egonet5,\nedges of egonet, mean degree of the node’s neighbors As\nbefore, from the initial graph we extract subgraphs of size\n4As a reminder, egonet of a node is the induced subgraph of its neighbors.\n5The degree of an egonet is de?ned as the number of incoming and outgoing\nedges of the subgraph, when viewed as a super-node.\n\(a Higher and left is better runtime\n\(in seconds / logscale small markers medium markers big markers b Lower is better in seconds scale.\nFig. 6: Accuracy and runtime of alignment of unipartite graphs. \(a red points accurate and faster than all the\nbaselines for all graph sizes. \(c red squares the baseline approaches, followed closely by Umeyama’s\napproach \(green circles or equivalently, 264-6K edges per noise level accuracy vs. runtime plot in Fig. 6\(a 


of\naccuracy and runtime for all the graph sizes depicted. Although\nNMF achieves a reasonably good accuracy for the graph of\n200 nodes, it takes too long to terminate; we stopped the runs\nfor graphs of bigger sizes as the execution was taking too\nlong. The remaining approaches are fast enough, but yield poor\naccuracy.\nRuntime Figure 6\(b in logscale the\nfastest approach, closely followed by Umeyama’s algorithm.\nNetAlign-deg is some orders of magnitude slower than the\npreviously mentioned methods. However, NetAlign-full\nran out of memory for graphs with more than 2.8K edges; we\nstopped the runs of the NMF-based approach, as it was taking\ntoo long to terminate even for small graphs with 300 nodes and\n1.5K edges. The results are similar for other graph sizes that,\nfor simplicity, are not shown in the ?gure. For graphs with\n200 nodes and ? 1.1K edges \(which is the biggest graph for\nwhich all the methods were able to terminate than\nNetAlign-deg; 2, 927× faster than NetAlign-full;\nand 31, 709× faster than the NMF-based approach.\n396\nVI RELATED WORK\nThe graph alignment problem is of such great interest\nthat there are more than 150 publications proposing different\nsolutions for it, and spanning numerous research ?elds: from\ndata mining to security and re-identi?cation [13] [18], bioin-\nformatics [4] [15] [22] , databases [17], chemistry [23], vision,\nand pattern recognition [9]. Among the suggested approaches\nare genetic, spectral, clustering algorithms [20 decision trees,\nexpecation-maximization [16], graph edit distance [21], sim-\nplex [2], non-linear optimization 12], iterative HITS-inspired\n[5][28]. Notice that all these works are designed for unipartite\ngraphs, while we focus on bipartite graphs.\nOne of the well-known approaches is Umeyama’s near-\noptimum solution for nearly-isomorphic graphs [24]. The\nmethod solves the optimization problem minP||PAPT ?B||\n\(where P is permutation matrix weighted\ngraphs with the same number of nodes. The Hungarian al-\ngorithm [19] is employed at the end to ?nd the node corre-\nspondences. The constraint that P is doubly stochastic matrix\nis imposed in [26] and [29 where the proposed formulation,\nPATH, is based on convex and concave relaxations. Ding et al\n[10] recently proposed a Non-Negative Matrix Factorization\n\(NMF applies an iterative algorithm to ?nd the orthogonal matrix\nP with the node correspondences.\nBradde et al. [7 propose distributed, heuristic, message-\npassing algorithms, based on Belief Propagation [27], for\nprotein alignment and prediction of interacting proteins. In-\ndependently, Bayati et al [3] formulate graph matching as an\ninteger quadratic problem, and also propose message pass-\ning algorithms for aligning sparse networks. A sparse and\nweighted bipartite graph, whose edges represent the possible\nnode matchings between the two graphs is required by these\nalgorihms. The use of the full bipartite graph was proposed\nearlier by Singh et al 22].\nIn all these works, the graphs that are studied are unipartite,\nwhile we focus on bipartite graphs, and also propose an\nextension of our method to handle unipartite graphs.\nVII. DISCUSSION\nThe experiments show that BIG-ALIGN solves ef?ciently a\nproblem that has been neglected in the literature: the alignment\nof bipartite graphs.\nGiven that all the efforts have been targeted at aligning uni-\npartite graphs, why matching bipartite graphs deserves being\nstudied separately? Firstly, bipartite networks are omnipresent:\npeople like webpages belong to online communities, access\nshared ?les in companies, post in blogs, co-author papers,\nattend conferences etc. All these settings can be modeled\nas bipartite graphs. Secondly, although it is possible to turn\nthem to unipartite and apply an off-the-shelf algorithm, as\nshown in the experiments, knowledge of the speci?c structural\ncharacteristics can prove useful in achieving better quality\nalignments. Lastly, this problem enables emerging applica-\ntions. For instance, one may be able to link the clustering\nresults from different networks by applying soft clustering on\nthe input graphs, and subsequently our method on the obtained\nnode-cluster membership graphs.\nAlthough the main focus of our paper is bipartite graph\nalignment the latter inspires an alternative way of matching\nunipartite graphs, by turning them to bipartite. Therefore we\nshow how our framework can handle any type of input graphs,\nwithout any restrictions on its structure.\nFinally, is our approach simply gradient descent? The\nanswer is negative; gradient descend is the core of our algo-\nrithm, but the projection technique, appropriate initialization\nand choice of the gradient step, as well as careful handling\nof known graph properties are the critical design choices that\nmake our algorithm successful \(as shown in Sec. V, where we\ncompare our method to simple gradient descend BIG-ALIGN-\nBasic class of real graphs, bipartite graphs. Our\ncontributions can be summarized as follows:\n1 introduce a powerful primitive with\nnew constraints for the graph matching problem.\n2 an effective and ef?cient algo-\nrithm, BIG-ALIGN, based on gradient descent \(APGD optimization problem with careful\nhandling of many subtleties. We also give a generalization\nof our approach to align unipartite graphs \(UNI-ALIGN 


UNI-ALIGN are superior to state-of-the-art\ngraph matching algorithms in terms of both accuracy and\nef?ciency for bipartite as well as unipartite graphs.\nFuture work includes extending our problem formulation\nto subgraph matching by revisiting the initialization of the\ncorrespondence matrices.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis material is partially supported by the National Science Foundation\nunder Grant No. IIS1017415 and IIS-1217559, the Army Research Laboratory\nunder Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-09-2-0053, and Defense Ad-\nvanced Research Projects Agency \(DARPA information in this\ndocument does not necessarily re?ect the position or the policy of the Govern-\nment, and no of?cial endorsement should be inferred.

Conclusions The SHOTPUT mission , its unique trajectory and potential encounter with six different small bodies will provide a novel view of the composition of the solar system. The science return from the mission will help answer questions on formation, composition and evolution of small bodies in our local neighborhood In addition, the team has proposed a mission that is within budget based on heritage instruments satisfying the decadal survey requirements. The opportunity for spectacular science return on this rare trajectory should not be missed The innovative SHOTPUT mission is truly one of a kind Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Anita Sohus, Amber Norton and JPL Team X for their contributions to this work.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
