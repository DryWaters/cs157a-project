As one example problem of\nbig data, we study semantic age labels and facial aging pat-\ntern analysis on a large database. In aging analysis, one of\nthe great challenges is the lack of a large number of face\nimages with ground truth age labels. Unlike many other\nexample-based recognition problems where human annota-\ntions can be used as the ground truth labels for both train-\ning and testing, it is quite dif?cult to label the exact ages in\nface images by human annotators. An alternative is to ex-\nploit the unlabeled ages to enhance the age estimation per-\nformance. However, it is unclear whether the face images\nwith unlabeled ages can be used or not for age estimation,\nand how to use the unlabeled data. In this paper, we study\nthe two problems comprehensively under two paradigms:\nthe semi-supervised learning and unsupervised learning for\naging pattern analysis. We emphasize the importance of us-\ning ground truth age labels and a large database in order\nto derive a meaningful measure in the context of big data.\nOur study can make an impact on collecting aging patterns\nthat is very expensive and time consuming in practice.\n1. Introduction\n“Big Data” analysis is an emerging topic in computer vi-\nsion and pattern recognition. As one example problem of\nbig data, we study semantic age labels and facial aging pat-\ntern analysis on a large database. Human age estimation\nhas a number of potential applications, including business\nintelligence [19] and age-speci?c human-computer interac-\ntion 7]. The useful applications have attracted researchers\nto study age estimation deeply and broadly [6] [17 in order\nto make age estimation more robust and reliable for practi-\ncal use.\nThere are many challenges to develop a good age esti-\nmator. In reality, different people may age quite differently,\nbecause of the gene difference as well as life style and living\ncondition differences. In age estimation research, probably\nthe most dif?cult thing is the aging database collection. It\nis much more dif?cult than collecting a database for face\nrecognition. A large span of ages, e.g., from very young to\nmuch older, need to be collected with ground truth ages.\nIn aging database collection, it is important to have the\ntrue age label for each face image since it is not trivial to\nannotate the age by humans for each face image after the\ndatabase collection. In a very recent study [28], the authors\nhave shown that perceiving age in face photos by humans\nis a challenging task. The mean absolute error \(MAE MORPH [18], and is 8.13 years on face images\nfrom FG-NET [5]. These reported errors on human age per-\nception are even much higher than some computational age\nestimation methods, e.g., [9] [14] [29] [15] [10] [22 with\nMAEs about or below 5 years on the same databases.\nIt has also been shown in [16] that the face aging\ndatabase collected from the Internet contains outliers of age\nlabels. Even a robust age estimator was developed to deal\nwith the age label outliers, the age estimation results still\nhave large errors. For example, it was reported that when\nthe age estimator is learned from the collected face database\n\(with incorrect age labels with ground truth age labels MAE\ncould be 8.60 years on MORPH [18], and 9.49 years on\nFG-NET [5].\nSo, age labeling is a big issue in the context of “big data.”\nIt is very important to have age labels for both training and\ntesting. The performancemeasure \(e.g., MAE available for the test face images. Basically, we cannot\nrely on human annotations of the age labels for face im-\nages, either training or testing. This is very different from\nsome other computer vision problems, such as the general\nobject recognition [27], action recognition [13], and facial\nattributes [12]. In those problems the required labels can be\nobtained from human annotators, e.g., Amazon’s Mechani-\ncal Turk, without much dif?culty.\nIs there a way to deal with the age labeling problem?\nSuppose there is a collected face database which contains a\nnumber of face images without age labels. Should we only\nuse the face images with ground truth age labels? Or can\n2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops\n978-0-7695-4990-3/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CVPRW.2013.75\n458\nwe utilize the unlabeled ages i.e., face images without age\nlabels age labeling problem in age\nestimation. We explore the feasibility of using face images\nwith unlabeled ages to improve the age estimation perfor-\nmance. An illustration of the problem is shown in Figure\n1. Towards this goal, we put the age labeling problem into\ntwo paradigms: semi-supervised learning and unsupervised\nclustering. Both paradigms involve unlabeled ages, in con-\ntrast to the traditional supervised age estimation [6] [17].\nWe measure the age estimation performance under these\ntwo paradigms, and compare with the supervised learning\nbased estimation to assess the usefulness of unlabeled face\nimages. If the age estimation performance is suf?ciently\ngood using a small amount of labeled ages in combination\nwith a number of unlabeled face images, there may be no\nneed to turn to age labeling by human annotations. Human\nannotations 


of age labels are not accurate, and incorrect age\nannotations might hurt the age estimation accuracy 16].\nFurther, we study the problem of how many labeled ex-\namples are needed for age estimation to have a reasonably\ngood performance on a large database. This is valuable to\nreduce the cost and time for aging database construction.\nIn our study, we emphasize the importance of ground\ntruth age labels for a meaningful and quantitative measure.\nOtherwise, the conclusions may not make any sense as a\npractical guide to collecting aging patterns and age labels.\nWe notice that there was a semi-supervised approach to\nperceived age prediction 21], but their goal is very differ-\nent from ours. First, there is no ground truth age labels for\nthe research in [21], so it is dif?cult to tell if there is any\nadvantage to use unlabeled ages for age estimation; Sec-\nond, the work in [21] is about perceived age, while we fo-\ncus on chronological age estimation by a computer; Third,\nwe found that the clustering-based annotation of perceived\nages cannot work well in our experiment with ground truth\nages \(see Section 4 centers for the complex and subtle aging patterns.\nOur major contributions in this paper include: \(1 quan-\ntitatively assessing the usefulness of unlabeled ages for ag-\ning pattern analysis under different paradigms; and \(2 combination of unlabeled ages.\nIn the remaining of the paper, we exploit the unlabeled\nages under two paradigms in Sections 2 and 3, respec-\ntively. Several learning methods are investigated within\neach paradigm Then we present experiments on a large\ndatabase in Section 4. Finally, we draw conclusions.\n2. Exploiting Unlabeled Ages by Semi-\nSupervised Learning\nTo assess the usefulness of unlabeled ages for aging\npattern analysis, we place the problem into two learning\nFigure 1. Illustration of the problem we study: Is it feasible to\nutilize the unlabeled ages for aging pattern analysis? And how to\nuse them? \(The red patterns are labeled ages, and blue unlabeled 1  2 learning [25]. We explore the semi-supervised\nlearning paradigm in this section, and unsupervised learning\nnext. Both paradigms are compared to a supervised learn-\ning method to have a quantitative measure The supervised\nlearning is based on the support vector machines \(SVMs  only.\nWe investigate the feasibility of executing semi-\nsupervised learning for aging pattern analysis, and discover\nhow useful the unlabeled ages could be for age estimation.\nWe also study the required amount of labeled ages to de-\nvelop a robust age estimator.\nThere are a number of techniques developed for semi-\nsupervised learning [30]. For our study, we investigate three\nmethods to exploit the unlabeled ages. A brief description\nof the methods is presented below.\n2.1. Semi-supervised Discriminant Analysis\nSuppose we have a set of l face images with age labels\n{\(xi, yi xi}l+ui=l+1. The classic Linear Discriminative Analysis\n\(LDA ratio\nof aT Sba over aT Sta is maximized, where the between-\nclass scatter matrix Sb and total scatter matrix St \(the sum-\nmation of the within-class and between-class scatter matri-\nces data set.\nA regularizer can be imposed to the standard LDA to\nchange the optimization problem into the following [11],\nmax\na\naTSba\naT Sta + ?J\(a 1 a complex-\n459\nity and the coef?cients ? balances between the model com-\nplexity and the empirical loss. The regularizer J\(a when they are available [2].\nThe unlabeled data are used to construct a p-nearest\nneighbor graph G to model the relationship between nearby\ndata points. Thus, a natural regularizer can be de?ned as\nfollows:\nJ\(a n?\nij\n\(aTxi ? aTxj 2 n{\n1, if xi ? Np\(xj xi 3 xi xi.\nD is a diagonal matrix; its entries are the column sum of\nW , Dii =\n?\nj Wij .\nUsing the regularizer derived from unlabeled face im-\nages, the objective function of semi-supervised discriminant\nanalysis \(SDA 2] is given by,\nmax\na\naT Sba\naT \(St + ?XLXT 4 func-\ntion is given by the solution of the following generalized\neigenvalue problem:\nSba = ?\(St + ?XLXT 5 5 aging pattern\nanalysis.\n2.2. Manifold Regularization\nBelkin et al. [1] proposed a graph-based manifold reg-\nularization \(MR data as a reg-\nularization term. It can be performed as semi-supervised\nlearning when unlabeled samples are available. The man-\nifold regularization framework employs two regularization\nterms:\nf argmin\nf\n1\nl\nl?\ni=1\n\(f\(xi 6 in our case,\nit is de?ned as the residue square error over all labeled ex-\namples.

intrinsic geometry.\nSindhwani et al. [20] gave a semi-supervised kernel that\ncan cover all input data including both labeled and unla-\nbeled. The kernel supports induction.

Unsupervised Learning of Aging Patterns\nTo further assess the usefulness of unlabeled ages, we\nalso study the unsupervised learning paradigm for ag-\ning pattern analysis, in addition to the semi-supervised\nparadigm. For unsupervised aging pattern analysis, we use\nthe classic k-means clustering algorithm and a more ad-\nvanced spectral learning technique [24].\nTo test the clustering result of the aging patterns for each\nalgorithm, we compare the clusters with the ground truth\nage labels. Speci?cally, the majority of the age labels within\neach cluster is used as the cluster’s age label, and assigned\nto each pattern within that cluster as the “estimated” age.\nThen we can compute the estimation errors for the whole\ndata set.\n3.1. K-Means Clustering of Aging Patterns\nWe use the k-means clustering method for unsupervised\naging pattern analysis. The classic k-means algorithm re-\nmains a popular choice for real-world clustering tasks [26].\nWe explore if the aging patterns can be clustered into differ-\nent age classes using the k-means method.\nThe k-means optimization problem is to ?nd k clus-\nter centers c ? Rm from a set of aging patterns\nxi ? Rm by minimizing the following objective function:\nmin\n?\nxi?X ||f\(C,xi C,xi returns the\nnearest cluster center c ? C to xi from all clusters C using\nEuclidean distance. The optimization process starts with k\ninitial seeds \(randomly selected We attempt different k values to\nmeasure the difference.\n3.2. Spectral Clustering of Aging Patterns\nSpectral clustering [24] is a category of more advanced\nunsupervised learning techniques, which are usually more\neffective to ?nd clusters and can outperform some tradi-\ntional methods. Here we exploit if there is any advantage\nto use spectral clustering for aging pattern analysis. The ba-\nsic idea of spectral clustering is to measure the similarity\nbetween pairs of aging patterns and construct a similarity\ngraph G = \(V,E vertex vi represents one\naging pattern xi. Two vertices are connected if the simi-\nlarity sij between the corresponding patterns xi and xj is\npositive or larger than a certain threshold, and the edge is\nweighted by sij . A typical similarity function is computed\nby sij = exp\n\(\n? ||xi?xj ||22?2\n parameter\nto adjust the similarity measure. The clustering problem is\nthen to partition the similarity graph into groups such that\nthe edges between different groups have very low weights\nand the edges within a group have high weights.\nThe spectral clustering can have various similarity mea-\nsures and be solved with different methods. In our aging\npattern analysis, we adopt a very recent technique [4] to\ncluster the aging patterns.\n4 Experiments\nNow we exploit the unlabeled ages for aging pattern\nanalysis based on several experiments. First the database is\nintroduced for this study. Second, the experimental designs\nare described. Third, the experimental results based on the\nsemi-supervised learning paradigm are presented. Fourth,\nthe results of unsupervised learning or clustering are given.\nFinally, a comparisonwith an exiting approach is performed\non 


our database with ground truth age labels.\n4.1. Database and Aging Pattern Representation\nWe use the MORPH-II 18] database for our study,\nwhich contains more than 50,000 face images of different\ngender and ethnicity along with a span of ages from 16\nto 67 years. All face images have the ground truth labels\nof age, gender and ethnicity, which are important for our\nquantitative study of the age labeling problem. In MORPH-\nII however, the distribution of gender and ethnicity is very\nunbalanced. For example, it has about 77% Black faces,\n19% White, and 4% other races, e.g., Hispanic, Asian, and\nIndian. There are also more males than females. To study\nthe age labeling problem on a relatively balanced distribu-\ntion of various populations, we selected partial data from\nMORPH-II, following the suggestion in previous research\n[8]. Almost all White face images are used, and a matched\nnumber of Black faces is used to balance the number of face\nimages in the two races. In total, we have a database of\n21,060 face images chosen from the MORPH. In the se-\nlected database there are 2,570 White Female \(WF WM BF BM are\nperformed on each gender and ethnicity group separately.\nThen the average over the four groups is computed as the\n?nal quantitative measure.\nThe face images in the database are aligned with detected\neye centers, and cropped and normalized into a ?xed size,\ne.g., 60 x 60. For the aging pattern representation in face\nimages we use one of the state-of-the-art methods to ex-\ntract the biologically inspired features \(BIF  sup-\nport vector machines \(SVMs  estimation.\n4.2. Experimental Design\nTo exploit the unlabeled ages for aging pattern analysis,\nwe design age estimation experiments under two different\nparadigms: \(1 2 learning or clustering. The results are compared to the\ntraditional supervised learning based age estimation which\nis considered as the baseline. In supervised learning, only\nthe labeled ages are used to learn the aging functions with\nthe SVMs, while the unlabeled ages are not used. The aging\npatterns for testing are the same for all methods.\nUnder either paradigm, we perform 10 random runs of\nthe methods and compute the average and standard devia-\ntion. The purpose is to get a statistically meaningful results\nand avoid possible perturbations caused by the randomness.\nUnder the semi-supervised learning paradigm, we also\nstudy the age estimation performance with different per-\ncentages of labeled and unlabeled ages, so that we can mea-\nsure how many labeled ages are needed to develop a robust\nage estimator. This quantitative measure is of great value\nin practice, considering the expensive and time-consuming\naging pattern collection. Three methods are investigated un-\nder the semi-supervised learning paradigm to compare with\neach other and with the supervised learning results. All\nthree methods are new to aging pattern analysis.\nUnder the unsupervised learning or clustering paradigm,\nwe will discover if the clustering based methods can work\nor not, and evaluate the results using different numbers of\ncluster centers. The classic k-means clustering algorithm\nand an advanced spectral clustering method are used for this\ninvestigation.\nFrom our data set of 21,060 face images, 2,112 is ran-\ndomly selected as the ?xed test set, which is about 10% of\nthe whole data set. Then the remaining 18,948 face images\nare used as the training set. In the training set, we randomly\nselected a different amount of data, e.g., 10%, 20%, · · · ,\n90%, as the labeled ages, while the remaining as the unla-\nbeled ages in which the age labels are assumed unknown for\nthe semi-supervised learning paradigm.\n4.3. Results under Semi-Supervised Learning\nThe age estimation results under the semi-supervised\nlearning paradigm are shown partially in Table 1. The age\nestimation is performed within each gender and ethnicity\ngroup, and the average over the four groups is shown in\nFigure 2. The MAEs of age estimation are measured w.r.t.\nthe different amount of labeled ages, ranging from 10% to\n90%. We can observe that \(1 training, the age estimation errors are reduced for\neach semi-supervised method or the supervised learning ap-\nproach; \(2 approach,\nwhich demonstrates that the unlabeled ages are useful to\nimprove the age estimation performance compared to the\nsupervised learning, using the same amount of labeled ages.\nThus the unlabeled ages can be helpful under the semi-\nsupervised learning paradigm; \(3 differently in age estimation: the\nSDA is better than the MR, and the SRDA performs the best\namong the three 4 group has the smallest MAEs, the White Female and\nBlack Male have comparable MAEs, and the Black Female\nhas the highest MAEs; and \(5 from the 90% labeled ages. For a better method, e.g.,\nSRDA, the MAE difference \(from the 90% labeled ages is\nsmaller than other methods.\nThe average MAEs over the four groups are also shown\nin Table 1 partially ranging from 10% to 50% and the last\none 90% of labeled ages. The MAEs corresponding to dif-\nferent percentages of labeled ages are compared to the 90%,\nand the MAE differences are computed and shown in the 


ta-\nble. We can see that about 20-30% of labeled ages can be\ngood enough to reduce the MAE to about one year differ-\nence from the 90% labeled ages. This ?nding is very useful\nand valuable in practice. A small percentage of age labels\ncan be collected together with a large number of unlabeled\nages to develop a good age estimator. This new ?nding has\nnot been discovered by any previous research, to the best of\nour knowledge.\n4.4. Results under Unsupervised Clustering\nThe results of exploiting unlabeled ages under the unsu-\npervised clustering paradigm are shown in Figure 3. Only\nthe aging patterns for testing are used for this experiment,\nsince there is no training data needed in this paradigm. As\nstated in Section 3, the majority of the patterns within each\ncluster is considered as the cluster’s age label. Then the\nground truth age labels can be used to compare with the\ncluster labels for MAE measure. The averages over ten ran-\ndom runs with the deviations are shown for each clustering\nresult. The clustering is performed on the four gender and\n462\nTable 1.

The advanced spectral clustering approach ac-\ntually results in higher errors than the classic k-means clus-\ntering algorithm. This observation is different from those\non many databases in machine learning, revealing the spe-\ncial property of the aging patterns. Both clustering methods\nhave much higher errors compared to the semi-supervised\nor supervised learning results shown in Table 1 or Figure\n2. As a result, the unsupervised clustering paradigm cannot\nwork well for unlabeled aging pattern analysis. The reason\nmay be that the aging patterns are subtle and could not be\ngrouped naturally into separate clusters.\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nPercentage of Labeled Data y\nea\nrs nSupervised\nMR\nSDA\nSRDA\nFigure 2.

The study in [21] can-\nnot tell whether the unlabeled ages are useful or not for ag-\ning pattern analysis. Although the goal of [21] is differ-\nent from ours, we plan to compare the scheme in [21] with\nour approaches to discover more things. We implemented\nthe method in [21] by ourselves and do a similar age pre-\ndiction experiment on our database where all ground truth\nage labels are available. The result based on the method in\n[21] is shown in the ?rst row in Table 2 The MAE is 9.70\nyears, which is signi?cantly worse than our approaches.

The results of our approaches are shown in rows 2-\n4 in Table 2, where 20 labeled ages are used for our semi-\nsupervised learning, which is the minimum amount needed\nbased on our quantitative study shown in Table 1 and Figure\n2, respectively.\n463\nTable 2.

Based on our investigation of the\nunsupervised learning paradigm in Section 4.4, the cluster-\ning method is not proper for aging pattern analysis.\nIn addition to the problem caused by the clustering, there\nare some other issues that interpret the high errors using the\napproach in [21].

Conclusions\nWe have studied how to exploit the unlabeled ages\nfor aging pattern analysis using two paradigms, semi-\nsupervised learning and unsupervised clustering Several\nmethods have been explored under the two paradigms for\nour quantitative study. Based on our empirical evaluations\non a large database, we have discovered that the unlabeled\nages are useful to enhance the age estimation performance\nwhen they are properly utilized. The semi-supervised learn-\ning paradigm is appropriate to take advantage of the un-\nlabeled ages, while the unsupervised clustering paradigm\ncannot work well for aging pattern analysis. The reason\nmight be that the aging patterns are very subtle and their\ndistribution is too complex to have a natural separation by\nclustering. The labeled ages are necessary in exploiting un-\nlabeled ages. Based on our quantitative study, we found that\nabout 20% to 30% of labeled ages can be suf?cient to de-\nvelop a robust age estimator, comparing to using almost all\nlabeled ages \(e.g., 90 nding can make an impact\non collecting aging patterns and age labels, which are very\nexpensive and time consuming in the context of “big data.”\nReferences\n[1] M.

FROM\nTHE BEST \(p < 0.05 comparisons\nbegin to occur with same frequency and hence the advantages\nof ICE become less pronounced.\nFor our synthetic random-walk dataset ICE again generally\nprovided the best performance - but this time the results could\nnot be con?rmed to a statistically signi?cant level, even for\nlarger symbol sets. Note that in general the synthetic data\nprovided an easier task, with almost all methods performing\nbetter than for the real world energy data when quantizing\nto the same number of symbols. A potential explanation is\nthat the nature of the random walk means that the time series\nare more spread out in the space11, and hence it is easier to\ndiscriminate between time series in general. This results in\nless re?ned symbolizations \(with respect to comparisons closing the gap on the ICE quantizer\nas shown in the results. Finally, note that in this dataset the\nsymbol distributions for the time series are Gaussian, and this\nhelps promote the effectiveness of qSax.\nIt is worth also noting that aMSE \(which used the same core\nsimulated annealing algorithm as ICE, varying only the cost\nfunction chosen value of 900 for\nthe approximation of the continuous space in the GPU methods\nwas of an appropriate granularity. A ?nal observation is with\nregard to the poor performance of the MOE and Uniform\nquantizers Their consistent losses, and general inability to\nidentify the majority of nearest neighbours correctly, serve to\nhighlight that the consideration of quantization approach can\nbe vital to the effectiveness of data mining algorithms.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nMany quantization techniques which are thought of as\noptimal, are in fact only optimal within the context of a speci?c\nproblem domain such as signal reconstruction. In this work we\nhave shown that in the extremely prevalent case where quan-\ntized input is used as the basis for time-series comparisons,\nstandard approaches can lead to potential performance loss. To\naddress this issue we have presented a novel quantizer \(ICE computationally tractable implementation\neffective to large data. Our empirical results based upon three\ndifferent datasets \(and using various time-series lengths and\nsymbol-set cardinalities initial evidence for the\nsuperiority of ICE for comparison-based data mining tasks.\nEven though one might expect the assumptions that underpins\nICE to be violated by many real-world datasets, our results\nhave indicated that even when such violations occur our\nquantizer can still provide superior performance to current\nstate-of-the-art quantization approaches.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was funded by the RCUK Horizon Digital\nEconomy Research Hub grant, EP/G065802/1.\n11The variance in the pairwise distances between the original time series\nin the random walk dataset was over double that of the electricity dataset.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration. This infonnation will be \nused to create a baseline behavior for comparison with \nactual data to discriminate between nonnal and abnormal nbehavior. \nTable 3 is a list of biological diagnostic measurements to be \nincluded in CCSDS telemetry available for ground \npersonnel to complete a prognostic analysis used to predict \nmental illness would be occurring in the near future.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
