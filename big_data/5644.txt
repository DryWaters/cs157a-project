 The Strategy of Mining Association Rule Based on Cloud Computing  Lingjuan Li College of Computer Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications Nanjing, China fqlilj@163.com Min Zhang College of Computer Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications Nanjing, China  Abstract Cloud computing provides cheap and efficient solutions of storing and analyzing mass data. It is very important to research the data mining strategy based on cloud computing from the theoretical view and practical view. In this paper, the 
strategy of mining association rules in cloud computing environment is focused on. Firstly, cloud computing, Hadoop MapReduce programming model, Apriori algorithm and parallel association rule mining algorithm are introduced. Then, a parallel association rule mining strategy adapting to the cloud computing environment is designed. It includes data set division method, data set allocation method, improved Apriori algorithm and the implementation procedure of the improved Apriori algorithm on MapReduce. Finally, the Hadoop platform is built and the experiment for testing performance of the strategy as well as the improved algorithm has been done. The results show 
that the strategy designed in this paper can archive higher efficiency when doing frequent itemset mining in cloud computing environment Keywords-Association Rule Mining; Cloud Computing Parallel; Apriori; MapReduce I   I NTRODUCTION  Cloud Computing [1 is  a ne w b u sine ss m o d e l   I t  distributes the computing tasks to the resource pool constituted of a large number of computers, so that a variety of application systems can obtain computing power, storage space and a variety of software services on demand. The novelty of the Cloud Computing is that it almost provides unlimited cheap 
storage and computing power. This provides a platform for the storage and mining of mass data Based on parallel computing conditions and parallel mining demand under the cloud computing environment, we study the data set partitioning, data set allocation, and association rule mining algorithms. We Improve Apriori algorithm in order to combine it with the MapReduce programming model of cloud computing and mine the association rules from the mass data in parallel Hadoop[3 s  a n op e n s o u r ce so ft w a r e  o f Apa c h e I t  composes of the storage modules HDFS, computing modules

They work together to solve the problems of storing TB/PB-level data, and the efficient, reliable, scalable computing on such a large amount of data II  D ESIGN OF P ARALLEL A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING S TRATEGY  Association rule mining is an important research topic of data mining; its task is to find all subsets of items which frequently occur, and the relationship between them Association rule mining has two main steps: the establishment 
of frequent itemsets and the establishment of association rules Apriori algorithm [5 is th e  m o st class ic an d m o st w i dely  used algorithm for mining frequent itemsets which generate Boolean association rules. The algorithm uses an iterative method called layer search to generate \(k + l\ itemsets from the k itemsets With the dramatic increase of data amount and the continuous maturity of parallel computing technology, some parallel association rules mining algorithm has been proposed 6-8   T h e C o u n t Dist ri b u ti o n alg o r ith m is th e m o st  d i r ect  parallelization of the Apriori algorithm. In this algorithm, the global candidate itemsets and frequent itemsets are stored in 
each node; in each calculation step it gets the support counts of candidate itemsets for the local data using the Apriori algorithm; at the end of each scanning, it exchanges local support counts with all other nodes to generate global support counts. The Data Distribution algorithm partitions the candidate itemsets of frequent itemsets over each node based on the partition of database; each node calculates its own support of candidate itemsets. The Candidate Distribution algorithm combines the ideas of CD algorithm and DD algorithm; it partitions the data sets and the candidate item sets reasonably at the same time, so that each node can work independently 
We partially references the ideas of the above algorithms using parallel computing capabilities provided by cloud computing, design a strategy of parallel association rule mining for cloud computing environment. It includes data set division method, data set allocation method, improved Apriori algorithm, and the implementation procedure of the improved Apriori algorithm on MapReduce A  Improvement of Apriori Algorithm Apriori algorithm finds all the frequent itemsets by scanning the database time after time, and it will consume a lot of time and memory space when scanning the database with

 mass data, which will become the bottleneck of Apriori algorithm. So we improved Apriori algorithm to realize the parallelization, and the specific ideas are as follows a\ccording to certain principles, the transaction database is horizontally divided into n data subsets which are sent to m nodes b\ Each node scans its data subset to generate the set of candidate itemset p C candidate 1-itemset to candidate kitemset\; the support count of each candidate itemset is set 1 c\ The candidate itemset p C is divided into r different partitions, which are sent to r nodes with their support count d r nodes respectively accumulate the support count of the same itemset to produce the final practical support, and determine the set of frequent itemset p L in the partition after comparing with the minimum support count min_sup e\ Merge the output of the r nodes to generate the set of global frequent itemset L  The advantage of the improved Apriori algorithm is that it can find all the frequent itemsets by scanning the transaction database once, so the time complexity is significantly lowered B  Combination of the Improved Aprior algorithm and MapReduce Cloud computing uses MapReduc pro gra m m i ng  model. MapReduce is the emerging parallel programming system invented by Google. It puts parallelization, fault tolerance, data distribution, load balancing into a library, and the system sums up all operations on the data to Map stage and Reduce stage. To submit handling procedures of all operations to the MapReduce programmer only need to define Map function and Reduce function. Based on the size of the input data and the job configuration information, MapReduce system can automatically initialize the job to multiple same Map Tasks and Reduce tasks, and they respectively read different input data blocks and order the Map function and Reduce function to process        Figure 1  Aarchitecture of MapReduce Fig. 1 shows the architecture of MapReduce, which mainly consists of three modules. Client submits parallel processing job written by the user to the Master node; the master node automatically decomposes user's job into Map tasks and Reduce tasks, and assigns the task to the worker; Worker requests to the Master for tasks, while distributed file system consisting of multiple Workers stores input/output data of MapReduce We implement the improved Apriori algorithm based on MapReduce programming model of cloud computing environment as follow steps a\ Partitioning and distributing data MapReduce library horizontally divides transaction database into n data subsets which are sent to m nodes executing Map tasks b\ Formatting the data subset Format n data subsets as <key1,value1>, which is Tid,list>, Tid is transaction identifier; list is the values corresponding to the transaction in the transaction database c\ Executing Map task The task of Map function is scanning each record <Tid list> of the input data subset and generating a set of local candidate itemsets as p C Support count of each candidate itemset is set 1. Map function generates and outputs intermediate <key2, value2>, defined as <itemset, 1>, itemset is the candidate in p C The following is pseudo code of the map function map\(Tid 002 list Tid 002 transaction identifier list 002 values corresponding to the transaction for each itemset in list EmitIntermediate\(itemset,1 d\erating Combiner function When the transaction database is large, and the transaction records of each divided data subset are similar, Intermediate duplicate key2 values will account for a large proportion. For example, each Map function generates thousands of such records < {I1}, 1>. All these records will be sent to the specified Reduce function through the network. Undoubtedly that will consume valuable network resources, increase the delay and reduce the I/O performance. Therefore, add an optional Combiner function to the machine which implements Map tasks. Combiner function firstly combines the output of the Map function in the local and output <itemset, sup>, sup denotes the support count of itemset in data subset; then use the partition function as in \(1\ to divide the intermediate pairs generated by Combiner function into R different partitions Each partition will be assigned to a specified Reduce function R m m m m m h R key hash k j j j k k mod  10       mod   1 3 2 1 002     002 1 Parameter k m is the ordinal number of items of candidates k in the transaction database, according to the assumption of Master Worke r Worker Worker User program Worker Worker Split0 Output0 Output1 Submit job Intermediate result Map Reduce Input file Output file Split1 Split2

 Apriori, items of transaction or itemsets are sorted by the order of the dictionary. Following is the pseudo code of combiner function Combiner \(itemset, list \(1 int sup=0 for each 1 in list sup+ =1 EmitIntermediate\(itemset, sup e\Executing Reduce task The nodes assigned Reduce tasks read <itemset, sup submitted by Combiner function. As many different candidates are mapped to the same Reduce function, the key-itemsets are sorted to make the data with the same candidates aggregate together to form <itemset, list\(sup\>. After traversing intermediate data, the worker nodes submit <itemset, list\(sup to the Reduce function, and Reduce function adds up the support count of the same candidates and gets the actual support count of the candidates in the whole transaction database; then compare it with the minimum support count min_sup and determine the set of frequent itemsets in the partition, denoted by p L The following is the pseudo-code of reduce function Reduce \(itemset, list\(sup list\(sup\:  list of support counts int result=0 for each sup in list result+=ParseInt\(sup Emit \(itemset, result f\erging the output of the Reduce function Merge the output of the Reduce to get the final set of frequent itemsets L Thus, all the frequent itemsets have been found C  Partition and Distribution of Data Set In order to exert the advantage of cloud computing adequately, it is needed to partition and distribute data reasonably The cluster system under the cloud computing environment emphasizes high scalability and capability of parallel processing. Data partition and distribution impact load balancing and communication granularity. There are two methods of data distribution a\Static data distribution The process of data distribution is set at the stage of the program design. While executing the program, it distributes the data to nodes doing calculation using the prearranged distribution method. The static data distribution can deal with the problem of load balancing effectively under the light network load and machine load environment b\ Dynamic data distribution The process of data distribution is dynamic in the process of calculation. The master node doesn't distribute all the data once. It distributes the rest data when certain worker node completes the calculation and transmits the result to the master node until all the data is processed In this paper, we propose a method of data set distribution as follows The MapReduce library of Google divides the input file to N data segments. The size of each data segment is between 16MB and 64MB. Hadoop sets the size of data segment as 64MB. We chooses 16MB\(a quarter of data segment of Hadoop\s the size of data segment and use 16MB as the distribute unit to obtain better load balance Dataset D is divided into n data subsets, if the number of nodes executing the Map task is m there m n 4 002  002   n i i D D 1 And 003  004 004 n D D D 003 2 1 in addition to the last data subset n D the rest are all 16MB. The number of distribution data set of node j can be expressed as MB D j j 16  005 006 007 2 j 006 expresses the ratio of distribution data set of node j   W W j j  006 3 W expresses the overall capability weight of the node executing the Map task in the cluster system  002   m j j W W 1 4 As integrated computing capabilities of a single-node in cluster are related to the three resource configuration: the CPU speed, available memory size and disk I/O speed, the integrated computing capability weight of node j is defined as IO j RAM j CPU j j W W W W    5 In which, the CPU weight of  node j is V V W j CPU j   memory weight is M M W j RAM j  I/O weight is B B W j IO j  The ratio of these three resources of the node and the corresponding resources of reference points in the cluster reflects the relative performance difference of heterogeneous nodes. The integrated computing capability weight of node j is also simply expressed as   j j j j IO RAM CPU W   003   
477 


 Various computing resources of each node have different effects on different types of loads, so that the integrated weight is related to load type. The weighted load capacity of node is defined as IO j j RAM j j CPU j j j W W W W       3 2 1 010 010 010 6 In which, the parameter k j 010 represents dynamic ratio of utilization of resource k \(CPU, memory, I/O\ of node j by the load, and 1 3 2 1    j j j 010 010 010  III   E XPERIMENT AND A NALYSIS  In order to test the performance of the strategy designed by us, experiment has done on the Hadoop platform. In the experiment, IBM's Quest Synthetic Data Generator  chosen to generate the experimental data for association rules mining. The total number of transactions is 100000, and each transaction contains 20 items on average, the average length of frequent itemsets is 5 In the experiment, Ubuntu + eclipse + hadoop are used as software environment, 10 PCs with not exactly the same configuration are used as hardware resources Fig. 2 shows the time effect of the improved algorithm and the data set distribution method  Figure 2  Experimental results The curves reflect the changes of the time complexity of the improved algorithm when using and not using the data set distribution method proposed in this paper. Apparently, under the cloud computing environment, the improved algorithm has better performance on mining frequent itemsets from the mass data, and the data set distribution method can improve the efficiency of the improved algorithm IV  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we have studied parallel association rule mining strategy in the cloud computing environment; proposed the data set partition method, data set distribution method, and improved Apriori algorithm; implemented the improved algorithm based on MapReduce programming model on the Hadoop platform.

Call large items time vector generating function 9 vector generating function 10 5 The above algorithm is efficient, because we use a similar method of incremental association rules, improve it and just scan a small number of the data in database B. Algorithm complexity analysis Let DS| be the number of the records in the whole database, N be the number of the basic windows in the whole database, k be the size of the basic window, and then the average number of the records in each basic window be DS N When the algorithm under the worst situation, each basic window because of sliding window function will be repeat scanned many times. The times of the basic windows in the first sliding window and sliding window may respectively scan to be 1, 2, ..., k. The middle of the basic window may scan k times repeated, which is equivalent to a basic window repeat scan k\(k+1 N-2k condition is to find out n-large itemsets, and the average number of records of each basic window is | / |DS N . So, the whole time complexity is approximately 1 2 


the new basic window has no new large itemsets, so the time complexity is approximately   complexity greatly reduced. The average time complexity of the algorithm is \( \( \( 1 2  IV. NUMERICAL REUSLTS By using the adventure works database: SQL SERVER2005, we test the sales data to mine association rules. After pretreatment, the same order number in a shopping basket, we take one of the August 1, 2003 to July 31, 2004 analysis of data throughout the year, a total of 23,434 records The algorithm is implemented using PHP language experimental platform: CPU is a Pentium \(R 543 E5300 2.60GHz, memory is 2G, the operating system is Windows XP Under the support of 0.04, confidence level of 0.6 conditions, the results are obtained with the time vector of association rules as follows 871 870 872 870 880 870 930 921 929 921 2003 8 1,2004 7 31 2003 8 1,2004 7 22 2003 8 1,2003 9 25 2003 8 1,2004 7 31 2003 8 7,2003 11 8 2003 11 14  CV CV CV CV CV T T T T

For example, the associations rule 871? 870 throughout the period included on the database is valid. The associations rule 923? 934 in the time period December 24, 2003 to February 19, 2004 and the time period March 12, 2004 to May 21, 2004 as these two time periods is effective. The above association rules are graphically represented in Figure 1 as follows  20038-1 20038-31

Time periods of association rule To compare the algorithm execution time under the different support for the association rule with time, the result is shown in Figure 2. From the Figure 2, when the algorithm is in a high support, efficiency is very high with the increase of support. Particularly, when support is small the algorithm is much less efficient. This is because the result of uneven distribution of the data. The adventure works sales data in the database are distributed unevenly so that some of the basic window data is very dense under the 


low support. Hence, the algorithm will produce a large number of large itemsets, resulting in reduced efficiency of the algorithm. Therefore, the algorithm under the even data distribution can achieve better results 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 0.2 0.1 0.08 0.04 t s  Figure 2.  The algorithm execution time under the different support V. CONCLUSION This paper studies the dynamic association rules with time, based on the time vector to represent the dynamic association rules. We propose an algorithm that can mine the dynamic association rules. These dynamic association rules include some practical significance in what time period will appear on the association rules. The numerical experiments show that the algorithm can efficiently reduce the number of the scanning database within the less execution time. In addition, there are some limitations of the algorithm, such as some large itemsets may be lost and sensitive to the change of support.

While focusing on the sample cost and using the strata that are more likely to contain tuples where A = a is clearly important, variance of estimation is another important issue, since it corresponds to the error of estimation. Thus, we de?ne the integrated cost by taking into account the variance of estimation 2s and the sampling cost SampCost Cost = ?s  SampCost + ?v  ?2s \(5 where ?s and ?v are weights for sampling cost and estimate variance, respectively, such that their sum is 1. Users could set the two weights based on the importance they attach to these two factors. For example, if response to a query is needed quickly sampling cost should have a higher weightage The relation between input attributes and output attributes, as well as data distribution, are modeled by a tree built on the query space recursively. Each node in the tree represents a query subspace, and is associated with a query that comprises speci?c values for a subset of input attributes, the sample size, as well as the potential splitting attributes. The sample size shows how many data records would be drawn from the subpopulation of the node Algorithm 1 shows the process of splitting a node N , which as we stated above, is associated with the query Q, the sample size s, and a list of potential splitting attributes, PS. The inputs of the algorithm also include set Lf , which represents leaf nodes of the tree. At the beginning, the entire query space is represented by the root node. The corresponding query of the root node is null the sample size n is the size of the sample that is to be drawn from the entire population, and the potential splitting attributes list is the complete set of input attributes of this data source. The initial set of leaf nodes is empty The main goal of the algorithm is to split the query tree in a greedy way. For each potential splitting attribute, the integrated cost after splitting is computed according to the Expression 5. The input attribute which brings the most reduction in the integrated cost is selected. More speci?cally, ?rst, the integrated cost for the subpopulation of the node N is calculated. If this value is smaller than a prede?ned threshold ?, node N is set to be a leaf node \(Lines 2-5 considering the set of potential splitting attributes PS \(Lines 621 would be |DIA| strata under the space of node N . The integrated cost on |DIA| strata is computed. Let M ? PS with domain DM 


denote the input attribute with the minimum integrated cost after the split, and let the set of allocated sample sizes, computed by the sample allocation method explained later, be ASM . Then DM | children are generated for the node M . For each child CHi, i = 1, . . . , |DM |, the associated query is QN ?{M = mi sample size is asi ? ASM , and potential splitting attributes is PSN ? M . The process of splitting is then recursively applied to children of node N In the process of calculating costs during the strati?cation process, we need to perform sample allocation, i.e., divide the parent nodes sample size among the potential children nodes This is required for calculating the integrated cost for the potential split. This is based on our sample allocation method, which we 328 describe next in Section IV-B. Furthermore, for calculating the integrated cost, the variance of target value ?2i and probability of output attribute A = a, ?i, for each stratum is computed based on the pilot sample Initially, the strati?cation process on the query space begins by calling Stratification\(R, null, F IA, n, null root node. The process of strati?cation would stop if there is no leaf node with integrated cost larger than a prede?ned threshold Each leaf node in the tree is a ?nal stratum for sampling, and the associated sample size denotes the number of data records drawn from the subpopulation of the stratum B. An Optimized Sample Allocation Method Now, we introduce our optimized algorithm for sample allocation which integrates variance reduction and sampling cost As introduced in section IV-A, integrated cost is de?ned by taking into account of variance of estimation and sampling cost The goal of our sample allocation algorithm is to minimize the integrated cost by choosing the sample size, ni, for each stratum In our algorithm, we adjust the value of SampCost and ?2s so that their in?uences on the integrated cost are in the same unit SampCost SampCost SmpCost\(r where SmpCost\(r entire population, and ?r denotes the probability of A = a being true for the entire population 2 2s 


2r where ?2r 2 n denotes the variance of estimation of the target value on the entire population The key constraint on the values of the sample sizes for each strata is that their sum should be equal to the total sample size A vector n = {n1, n2, . . . , nH} is used to represent the sample sizes, where the ith element, ni, is the sample size for the ith stratum By including sampling cost and variance of estimation into the integrated cost, our sample size determination task leads to the following optimization problem Minimize Cost\(n  i\(?s ni i v N2i niN2 2 i subject to  i ni = n 6 where Ni denotes the population size of data records under the space of A = a in ith stratum. Note that this value may not be known if A is an output attribute. However, the total number of records in the ith stratum is typically known, and can be denoted as DNi. Then Ni can be estimated by ?iDNi, and the population size of A = a on the entire population is estimated by N  i ?i DNi For ?nding the minimum of integrated cost, we utilize Lagrange multipliers, a well know optimization method. Lagrange multipliers aims at ?nding the extrema of a function object to constraints. Using this approach, a new variable ? called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced and de?ned by n n  


 i ni ? n If n is a minimum solution for the original constrained problem then there exists a ? such that \(n Lagrange function. Stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of ?\(n n,??\(n 7 In our problem, by conducting partial derivatives on Formula 7 a group of equations are yielded as follows s i v N 2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? = 0 i = 1, ..H i ni = n 8 where the solution n leads to the minimum value of integrated cost in Formula 5 However, it is dif?cult to solve the group of equations directly Thus, we use numerical analysis to approximate the real solution. Newtons method is utilized for ?nding successively better approximations to the zeroes \(or roots Given an equation f\(x x tive of function f\(x method iteratively provides, xt+1, a better approximation of the root, based on xt, the previous approximation of root according to the following formula xt+1 = xt ? f\(xt f ?\(xt The iteration is repeated until a suf?ciently accurate value is reached, i.g. |f\(xt In our problem of Formula 8, there are H + 1 equations F \(xt xt xt n1, .., nH , ?}, where the equations in F \(xt fi\(xt s i v N 


2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? i = 1, .., H fH+1\(xt  i ni ? n The Newtons method is also applied iteratively via the system of linear equations JF \(xt xt+1 ? xt xt 9 where JF \(xt H + 1 H + 1 equation system F \(xt vector xt. The entry JF \(i, j d\(fi\(x dxj where fi\(x xt x From the Expression 9, a better approximation xt+1 is obtained based on previous approximation xt. The iterative procedure would be stopped if ?i|fi\(xt threshold, and then the sample size ni is allocated for each stratum so that the integrated cost is minimized. In reality, we are required to pick an integral number of records from each stratum during the sampling step. Thus, we round down each ni to its nearest integer, ni + 0.5 In the example shown in Table I, suppose we set both weights v and ?s to be 0.5. Further, assume the variance of the entire population, ?2r , to be 80000. The probability of A = a over the entire population ?r is 0.242. By using the proposed optimized sample allocation method, the sample sizes for the three strata 329 are 162, 299, and 139, respectively. In this case, the variance of estimation according to the Expression 2 is 93.66, and the estimated cost is 1943.7. We can see that, compared with Neyman allocation, the sampling cost is decreased by 42.1%, but results some increase in variance. Overall, this example shows that we can achieve lower sampling cost by trading off some accuracy C.

EVALUATION STUDY We evaluate our sampling methods for association mining and differential rule mining on the deep web using two datasets described below US Census data set: This is a 9-attribute real-life data set obtained from the 2008 US Census on the income of US households. This data set contains 40,000 data records with 7 categorical attributes about the race, age, and education level of the husband and wife of each household and 2 numerical attributes about the incomes of husband and wife 


Yahoo! data set: The Yahoo! data set, which consists of the data crawled from a subset of a real-world hidden database at http://autos.yahoo.com/. Particularly, we download the data on used cars located within 50 miles of a zipcode address. This yields 30,000 data records. The data consists of 7-attribute with 6 categorical attributes about the age, mileage, brand, etc, of the cars and one numerical attribute, which is the price of the car Variance of Estimation is estimated for the target value \(i.e mean value in differential rule mining, and con?dence in association rule mining is calculated according to the Expression 2. Since variance of estimation reveals the variation of the estimated value from the true value, smaller variance suggests better estimation Sampling Cost is estimated by the number of queries submitted to data sources in order to acquire a certain number of data records containing target output attributes, i.e. A = a. Larger sample size implies higher sampling costs in a deep web setting where the queries are executed over the internet Estimate accuracy is estimated by Absolute Error Rate \(AER Small AER value indicates higher accuracy. For an estimator on variable Y with true value y and estimated value y, the AER of the estimator is calculated by AER\(y A. Association Rule Mining In this section, we present the results of our method for association rule mining. Using our overall approach, we have created four different versions, which correspond to four different sets of weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling costs. 1 the weight ?v = 1.0 and ?s = 0.0, 2 the weight ?v = 0.7 and ?s = 0.3, 3 v = 0.5 and ?s = 0.5, and 4 weights ?v = 0.3 and ?s = 0.7. In addition, we also compare these approaches with a simple random sampling method, which is denoted by Random We focus on the queries in the form of A = a ? B = b where A and B are output categorical attributes. Other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes Our goal is to estimate Supp\(A=a,B=b A=a association rules are randomly selected from the datasets. Each of the 50 association rules are re-processed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations result is the average result for 5000 executions 


In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
