China  Corresponding author: E-mail: lzhwang@ynu.edu.cn  Abstract With the explosive growth and extensive applications of spatial data sets, it is becoming more and more important to solve the problem how to discov er knowledge auto matically from spatial data sets. Co-location patterns discovery is an important branch in spatial data mini ng. Traditional algorithms for colocation patterns mining can only find positive co-location patterns. However, negative co-location patterns, which are strong negative associated but whose participation index are less than a minimum prevalence threshold, sometimes would include great valuable information. In this paper, the concept of the negative co-location patterns is defined. Based on the analysis of the relationship between negative and positive participation index, methods for negative participation index calculation and negative patterns pruning strategies are given. The methods make it possible to discover both positive and negative colocations efficiently. The applications of the proposed algorithm are studied using the plant data sets of the ìThree Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areasî. Finally, an extensive experimental analysis is done to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms  Key-words  Spatial data mining, Co-location patterns, Positive patterns, Negative patterns, Pruning  I  I NTRODUCTION  Co-location patternsê mining is a rising and promising field in spatial data mining. Yet the approaches to discovering colocation patterns in the literatures can only find positive colocation patterns that are prevalent and strong correlated. In fact, many interesting patterns have not been discovered from databases. One of them is a negative co-location pattern which is non-prevalent but strong negative correlated   Discovering negative co-location patterns would be significant in certain applications. One application is to mining plantsê growing information. Botanists are not only interested in symbiosis, but also mutually exclusive plants. Another application is to identify competing items in business data Related Works In previous works on co-location patterns discovery, the concept of negative co-location patterns has not been discussed yet. For mining positive co-location patterns Morimoto [1 def in ed d istan cebased p atterns as k neighboring class sets. In his work, the number of instances for each pattern was used as the prevalence measure, which     Supported by the National Natura l Science Foundation of China under Grant No.60463004 and the Resear ch Foundation of the Educational Department of Yunnan Province \(No. 09Y0048 did not possess an anti-monotone property by nature Nevertheless, Morimoto used a non-overlapping instance constraint to get the anti-monotone property for this measure In contrast, Shekhar and Huang [2  develo p ed an ev ent cen tric  model which abolishes the non-overlapping instance constraint, and a new prevalence measure that has the desirable anti-monotone property called the participation index was defined. At the same time, Huang, Shekhar and X  pr o posed a gen er al m i n i ng appr oach Joi nb a s e d  approach mining co-location patterns, which established the basis of co-location patterns mining. Yoo and Shekhar developed the partial-join [4 and th e jo in-l ess 5  al gorith m s  to mining co-location patterns. Wang et resented a  novel algorithm for co-location patterns mining. In their paper a data structure called CPI-tree \(Co-location Pattern Instance Tree\roduced, which materializes spatial neighbor relationships Huang, Pei and Xiong [7  ad dres sed th e pr obl e m o f  m ini ng  co-location patterns with rare spatial events. In their paper, a new measure called the maxim al participation ratio \(maxPR was introduced and a weak monotonicity property of the maxPR measure was identified. Verhein and AI-Naymat  studied mining complex spatial co-location patterns from spatial datasets. They introduced the idea of a maximal clique and applied the GLIMIT item-set mining algorithm to their task Based o n t h e co ncep t o f  dy n a m i c p artici pation ind ex  Celik et al. studied the zonal co-location patterns discovery problem [1 g et al  11  discusses an o r d e r cliq ueb ased  method for mining maximal prevalence co-location patterns The above approaches mainly focused on the discovery of positive co-location patterns in a spatial database. While in traditional association rules mining, there are some efficient negative rules mining approaches. One approach for mining negative association rules was presented in This approach needs a user-specified hierarchical structure, which is difficult to be put into pr actice. An approach based on interest value for both positive and negative association rules mining was proposed in [13  It used A p r i or i l ike alg or i t h m  for generating candidate item-sets, which may bring on missing non-prevalent item-sets that is useful. An approach based on support, confidence and association coefficient for both positive and negative association rules mining was prop A s s o ciati o n coe f f i c i ent n eed  t o be adjuste d  during implementing algorithms. Additionally, this algorithm canêt find all of the negative association rules. A novel effective algorithm for mining negative association rules 398 


called MNAR was proposed in [1 MN AR ca n d iscover  all of the negative association rules. In order to reduce the complexity of the support calculation in Apriori-like algorithm MNAR provided a bit-based method, which introduced a logical operation çoré in support calculation Our Contributions First, the concepts of negative colocation patterns and rules are defined. Some lemmas are proved, which are used to improve performance of our algorithm. Second, after analyzing the relationship between positive and negative co-location, an algorithm for discovering both positive and negative co-locations is developed. Third the applications of mining both positive and negative colocations are studied in the plant data sets of çThree Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areasé. Finally, we conducted experimental evaluation using a real dataset. The results show that our algorithm is correct and efficient Organization Section 2 gives the basic concepts of negative co-location patterns and rules. Then, based on the analysis of the relationship between negative and positive participation index, some lemmas for negative participation index calculation and improving negative co-locations mining are given.  In Section 3, we present our proposed algorithm for discovering both positive and negative co-location rules Section 4 is experimental evaluations. The conclusions and future works are discussed in Section 5  II.   Basic Concepts and Lemmas   A.    Related Concepts of the Positive Co-locations  Given a set of spatial features F a set of their instances S  and a spatial neighbor relationship R over S  R could be topological relationships \(e.g. linked, intersection\distance relationships \(e.g. Euclidean distance metric\mixed relationships \(e.g. the shortest distance of two points on a map\shown in Fig. 1, there are 4 spatial features A, B, C  and D and their instances A 1 stands for the first instance of feature A If R is defined as a Euclidean distance metric and its threshold value is d two spatial objects are neighbors if they satisfy the neighbor relationship    d distance R   1  B  1  A 1  B  1  A    B.5 B.4 B.1 B.3 A.1 A.2 A.3 A.4 C.1 C.2 C.3  B.2   D.1  D.2            Fig. 1. An example data set  Given a subset of spatial instances  m i i i I   2 1   S I 012  I is called as an R-neighbor if I forms a clique under the neighbor relation R  A positive co-location c is a subset of spatial features, i.e F c 012 An R-neighbor I is a row instance of a positive colocation c if I contains instances of all the features in c and no proper subset of it does so. The table instance of a positive co-location c is the collection of all row instances of c  The interest degree of a positive co-location differs from the degree of support in traditional association rules mining. A new prevalence measure concept called the participation index is introduced in Pa r t i cipat i on r ati o w ill be p r esented  before giving the concept of participation index The participation ratio   i f c PR  for feature type i f in a size-k positive co-location c   k f f  1 is the fraction of instances of feature i f which participate in any row instance of co-location c The participation ratio can be computed as  i f c PR     i f ance table_inst c instance table i f     _  where  is the relational projection operation with duplication elimination The participation index of a positive co-location c   k f f  1 is the minimum in all  i f c PR  of co-location c   c PI    i k i f c PR  min 1    Example 1 In Fig. 1 A has 4 instances B has 5 instances and C has 3 instances. Two instances are connected with a solid line if they are neighbors. Suppose positive co-location c  A, B, C the table instance of co-location c has A.2,B.4,C.2}, {A.3,B.3,C.1}, {A.3,B.3,C.2 PR  c  A  since there are only A.2 and A.3 in the table instance. Similarly PR  c  B 5 PR  c  C 2/3 PI  C  min  PR  c  A  PR  c  B  PR  c  C 2/5 Given a minimum prevalence threshold min_prev a positive co-location c is a prevalent co-location if PI  c  min_prev holds Lemma 1 The participation ratio and the participation index are monotonically non-increasing with the size of the colocation increasing Proof Suppose a spatial instance is included in the table instances of co-location c For co-location c c 012  the spatial instance e must be included in the table instances of  c The opposite is not true. Therefore, the participation ratio is monotonically non-increasing Suppose     1 k e e c          1 1 1 1 min i k k i k e e c PR e c PI     015  015      min 1 1 i k k i e e c PR   015        min 1 c PI e c PR i k i     Therefore, the participation index of co-location is also monotonically non-increasing  Lemma 1 ensures that the participation index can be used to effectively prune the search space of co-location pattern mining  B.

According to Definition 3 negative co-location patterns D B A    D B A    D B A    and D B A   are prevalent. But the negative co-locations  D B A   and D B A   are non-prevalent since prev D A PI min_ 25  0       Lemma 2 Let __ Y X 015 be a candidate prevalence negative colocation pattern, where      2 1 k X X X X   If k A A A    2 1 are respectively the number of instances of spatial features k X X X    2 1 in the positive co-location Y X 015 the PI  of negative co-location __ Y X 015 will be     min   2 2 2 1 1 1 __ k k k X A X X A X X A X Y X PI     015  2 where i X is the number of instances of spatial feature i X  Proof Because the PR of each spatial feature in Y X 015  is i i X A the PR of each positive spatial feature in __ Y X 015 is i i i i i X A X X A    1 According to Definition 2     min   2 2 2 1 1 1 __ n n n X A X X A X X A X Y X PI     015  holds Example 3 Again Fig. 1, for the negative co-location     D B A T  there is only table instance A.3, B.3, D.1 in the relevant positive co-location A, B, D By using Lemma 1 PI  T in PR  T, A  PR  T, B 1-1/5 Lemma 3 Let __ Y X 015  and __ Y X 015   be prevalence negative colocation patterns.

Difficulties in Discovering Negative Co-location Patterns  1\he spatial computation is time-consuming Since the instances of spatial features are embedded in a continuous space and share complex spatial relationships, a large fraction of the spatial computation cost is devoted to identifying the spatial instances and relationships between spatial instances 2\stent algorithms canêt be reused First of all, the negative association rules mining algorithms can not be reused in mining negative co-location patterns since there are no traditional çtransactionsé in spatial data sets. Also algorithms of positive co-location mining can not be used directly since some methods must be redesigned \(such as calculating the PI  3\enerating negative co-location patterns is timeconsuming The number of candidate negative co-location patterns increases exponentially with the size of data sets  III.   Mining both Positive and Negative Co-locations   First the method of calculating the PI of a candidate negative co-location based on the relevant positive colocationês instances is given by Lemma 2.  Thus, the algorithm is designed to mining both positive and negative co-locations Moreover, Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 are the guarantees of performing a large number of prunings Second, all spatial features are size-1 prevalent co-locations according to the definition of the participation index measure In order to make the candidate co-locationsê set closer to the prevalent co-locationsê set, size k 1\ prevalent co-locations join with each other to generate candidate co-locations in positive co-location mining algorithms. However, negative colocation patterns are generated by non-prevalent co-locations In order to guarantee that all positive and negative prevalent co-locations could be discovered, the sizek candidate colocations are generated by joining the size k1\ and size-1 prevalent co-locations Finally, the new algorithm has four phases. The first phase computes neighborhood relationships between spatial instances, and finds neighborhood relationship set of each spatial instance \(star neighborhoods\.  The second phase generates sizek positive and negative candidate co-locations The third phase uses the ideas of the Apriori-like and the joinless algorithm to generate sizek positive prevalent colocations. The fourth phase generates sizek negative candidate co-locations, and then discovers prevalent negative co-locations and negative rules Algorithm 1 is described as followings Input  F  n f f f   2 1 a set of spatial feature types S a set of spatial instances <feature type, feature instance id, location R spatial neighbor relationship \(e.g., Euclidean distance min_prev prevalence threshold min_conf conditional probability threshold Output PL strong positive co-location rules NL strong negative colocation rules Variables NT    n f f f NT NT NT   2 1 a set of spatial neighbor relationships where i f NT is the set of neighbor instances of the spatial feature i f  k co-location size k H a set of sizek positive and negative candidate co-locations k C a set of sizek positive candidate co-locations T k  a set of table instances of co-locations in C k  k P a set of sizek positive prevalent co-locations k Q a set of sizek positive co-location rules k L a set of sizek negative candidate co-locations k B a set of sizek negative prevalent co-locations k I a set of sizek negative co-location rules Steps 1   PL    NL  F P  1    1 B  2 NT near F, S, R Spatial computations are performed in this procedure In fact, the step converts a spatial data set S to a set of disjoint star neighborhoods NT  3 for k=2    1 k P k++\ do 3.1 k H gen_cand_co-location 1  k P  1 P  3.2 k C gen_cand_positive H k P k-1  3.3 T k gen_table_instance k C  NT  3.4 k P select_prev_positive k C  T k  min_prev  3.5 k Q select_positive_rule k P  T k  min_con f 3.6 k k k P H L    3.7 for each A in k L  do  3.7.1 for each A Y X  015  prev X PI min_     prev Y PI min_     do  3.7.2 if  __ Y X 015  Y X 015 cannot be pruned by Lemma 2 and 3 3.7.3 then gen_table_instance Y X 015  NT  3.7.4 if  prev Y X PI min_    015  then  Y X B k 015   3.7.5 if  prev Y X PI min_    015  then  Y X B k 015   3.7.6 else  Y X B k 015    endfor endfor 3.8 I k select_negative_rule B k  min_conf  3.9 k Q PL PL 015   3.10 k I NL NL 015   endfor Return  PL, NL  Several core steps in Algorithm 1 1\tep \(3.2 generates the set of candidate positive colocations C k  In this step, we delete all candidate co-locations k H c  such that some size k 1 subset of c is not in P k1 In this procedure, the multiresolution pruning method proposed in [3  can be used for spatial datasets with strong autocorrelation, i.e where instances tend to be located near each other 2\ Step \(3.3 generates table instances set T k of candidate co-locations set C k based on the spatial neighbor relationships set NT In this step, first, generate coarse table instances of a 40 1 


candidate co-location by gathering from the i f NT if the first feature of the candidate co-location is i f Second, filter colocation instances by looking up all instances of the colocation of features except the first feature of the candidate colocation. For example, to check the coarse instance A 1 B 1  C 1} of co-location A, B, C we examine whether the subinstance B 1 C 1} except A 1 is in the table instances set of co-location B, C  3\ Step \(3.7 generates all prevalent negative co-locations It is time-consuming. The cause is that the negative items of each non-prevalent co-location will be combined to identify prevalent negative co-locations. For example, suppose the colocation A, B, D is a non-prevalent co-location, then we have to combine negative co-locations      D B A      D B A      D B A      D B A      D B A and to identify sub-colocations AB, BD, AD are prevalent or not, and then to calculate the PI of them respectively. This process can be improved due to pruning based on Lemma 3 and Lemma 4  IV.   Experimental Evaluation   We evaluated the performance and application values of Algorithm 1 with a real-world plant distribution data set that contains distribution information of plant species in the çThree Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areasé area. All experiments were conducted on a 3-GHz Pentium PC computer with 2G megabytes main memory, running the Microsoft Windows XP operating system. All programs were implemented in Java In the plant dataset, the number of plant species \(spatial feature types\ is 16. Three parameters, namely number of plant instances n threshold min_prev patial neighbor distance threshold d varied during the experiments for verifying the effects of parameters and the performance of Algorithm 1  A.    Effect of the Number of Spatial Instances  We examined the performance of Algorithm 1 with the number of spatial instances. First, we compared Algorithm 1 with the algorithm which only mines the positive co-locations As shown in Fig. 2\(a\he algorithms execution time significantly increased with the increment of the number of spatial instances. At the same time, the gap between the two algorithms becomes wider. This is because the increments of table instances and star neighborhoods set NT Notice the differences in the number of positive and negative colocations, and that of pruned co-locations by using Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 in Fig. 2\(b\s can be seen, the result of using Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 in Algorithm 1 is very obvious. In the experiments, the parameters d and min_prev is set to 25 and 0.15 respectively Because of a bigger d and a smaller min_prev the number of negative co-locations is tremendous when the number of spatial instances is 11300. It is important to set reasonable parameters in both positive and negative co-locations mining                  a    b  Fig. 2. Effect of the number of spatial instances: \(a\ running time comparison, \(b\e number of positive and negative co-loca tions  B.    Effect of Parameters min_prev and d  The following experiments examined the effect of the parameters min_prev and d Fig. 3 illustrates the effect of the min_prev for the running time and the numbers of positive and negative co-locations, while Fig. 4 shows that of the neighbor distance d for the running time and the numbers of positive and negative co-locations. In the experiments, the number of plant instances is 6000. The parameter d is set to 20 in experiments of Fig. 3. The parameter min_prev is set to 0.3 in experiments of Fig. 4. According to the figures, it can be seen that the effect of two parameters in Algorithm 1 is much greater than that in only positive co-locations mining. This means that the reasonable parameter setting is more important in both positive and negative co-locations mining. At the same time, we can notice that the effect of pruning by Lemma 3 and 4 is significant                        Fig. 3. Effect of prevalence threshold min_prev   402

Analysis of the Application Values  1\ry of the precious and rare plants by the negative rules We can discover precious and rare plants in the çThree Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areasé by the negative rules, because they appear in many negative rules in the form of negative-item. At the same time, if they appear in the positive rules in the form of ruleês left-item, we can find that their conditional probability values are almost 1 \(100%\For example, from the negative rules, we notice that the plant R sulphureum and the plant R. brachyanthum appear in many negative rules in the form of negative-item. In fact, these two Rhododendrons are very rare in this area. The positive rules contained them represent their growing community \(or conditions\. According to these positive rules, the rare plants growing conditions should be protected 2\very of exotic species by the negative rules The discovery of exotic species sometimes is a dangerous signal. We find two exotic species appear in negative rules in the form of negative-item, but they are not in any of positive rules. This is another contribution of negative rules 3\The alarms coming from the negative rules From the mining results, we find that there are many Rhododendrons and Arethusas that appear in negative rules in the form of negative-item. In fact, the region where the Rhododendrons and the Arethusas grow is very beautiful and is a famous tourist resort. The discovery of these negative rules alarms to the traveling administration  V.   Conclusions and Future Work   In this paper, we discussed concepts of negative co-location patterns and designed an algorithm for mining both positive and negative co-locations. In traditional algorithms for positive co-locations mining, some co-locations may be eliminated if they contain spatial features which have rare spatial instances. But using the algorithm proposed by this paper, the useful co-location rules are discovered as negative rules In the future, more reasonable prevalence thresholds and conditional probability thresholds will be studied. In order to find more useful rules, the different thresholds of positive colocations and negative co-locations need to be set. For example, when generating higher-size negative rules conditional probability threshold should be set higher, because it increases with the number of features  R EFERENCES  1 Y M o r i m o to Mining Freq uent Ne ighbo r ing C lass Set s in Sp atial  Databases,é In: Proc. of the se venth ACM SIGKDD Int.

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
