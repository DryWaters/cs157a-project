Using\nJSONMatch, our web service implementation of the model,\nwe show that the combination of this model and higher-order\nrepresentation provides a powerful and extensible framework\nthat is particularly well suited to analysing Big Variety data\nin a web application context.\nKeywords-data ?ow; data integration; heterogeneous data;\ndata mining; NoSQL;\nI. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK\nThe data ?ow model and choice of representation intro-\nduced in this paper were inspired by our earlier work on web\nservices for pro?ling and matching text. Similarly, our im-\nplementation, called JSONMatch, is a generalisation of our\nearlier SubSift web services framework [1], [2]. SubSift was\ndesigned to support work?ows that computed the pairwise\nsimilarity of two sets of textual documents. JSONMatch is\nalso able to perform this same task but instead of hard-\ncoding the work?owís transformations into the software,\nthey are de?ned dynamically by supplying higher-order\nJSON parameters to data ?ow transformations at runtime.\nThis development and the adoption of basic terms as the\nknowledge formalism enables entirely different work?ows,\ne.g. for cleaning and restructuring data, working with non-\ntextual data, and incorporating external web services.\nData ?ow approaches to analysing Big Data, using tools\nsuch as Pig and Hadoop, focus on batch processing of\nlarge datasets using parallelisation to reduce elapsed time\nto results but at the expense of increased working storage,\ncompute, development and operational costs. By contrast,\nin our work the focus is on analysing heterogeneous \(Big\nVariety is\nless important than the ease of integration with interactive\nweb applications and web service mash-ups. For smaller\ndatasets, non-parallelisable design patterns, such as shared\nglobal counters or accumulators, may be used to reduce the\nnumber of transformations in a data ?ow or for algorithmic\nsimplicity.\nJSONMatch runs as a web service, with an inbuilt web-\naddressable NoSQL store; it allows developers to specify\nand execute new data ?ow transformations through REST\nAPI calls. For small data, the results of transformations are\nreturned immediately; for larger data, HTTP polling detects\ncompletion. Extensibility is enabled through JSONMatchís\nability to incorporate web service calls to external web\nservices as embedded functions in higher-order parameters.\nOur higher-order data ?ow model could be viewed as a\ncombination of data- and task-parallel skeletons from higher-\norder algorithmic skeleton frameworks \(ASkF  an ASkF wrapped in web services, with\nskeletons expressed in JSON which, unlike most ASkF, has\nthe advantage of already being familiar to web developers.\nMDX queries for OLAP data warehouses have similarities\nto our higher-order data constructors, but have very different\ndata models and are tightly coupled to the SQL relational\nmodel. NoSQL databases like CouchDB and MongoDB\nshare similar JSON document storage and concurrent access\nfeatures to JSONMatch, but both have sophisticated sharding\nfeatures and built-in MapReduce support that is absent\nfrom our current implementation. CouchDB is most similar,\nhaving a built-in web server and REST API, and could\nbe potentially be used to implement our higher-order data\n?ow model. However, CouchDB lacks support for the data\nmining and machine learning features of JSONMatch. Such\nfeatures are found in analytics systems like RapidMiner and\nDatameer but with more complicated data ?ows. However,\nit would be possible to incorporate REST calls to the Weka\nmachine learning or the GATE text mining toolkits.\nWe note that data ?ow systems are not necessarily the\nsame as work?ow systems. Implementation of the latter,\nsuch as Kepler and Taverna [4], [5], typically incorporate\njob scheduling and management capabilities and may enact\ndata ?ows as part of a work?ow. However, in principle, it is\npossible to describe our data ?ows in a work?ow language\nand to share them through tools like myExperiment [6].\nIn the next section we introduce our higher-order ows,\ntransformations and parameters. Subsequent sections brie?y\ndescribe the individuals as terms knowledge representation,\nreport on the JSONMatch implementation and its applica-\ntions, before concluding with suggested future work.\nII. HIGHER-ORDER DATA FLOWS\nIn this section we give an intuitive overview of the main\ncharacteristics of our data ?ow model. The domain and\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 569\ncodomain for data ?ows in the model are relations. For the\npurposes of this introduction we de?ne a relation to be a\nset of key-value pairs from StringàD, for some domain D.\nWith suitable choices for D, relations can represent tables\nfrom relational databases documents/values from NoSQL\ndatabases, data objects from object databases and graph data\nfrom triple stores Our data ?ow model thus ranges over a\nbroad and useful range of data types.\nThe building blocks of a data ?ow 


are transformations.\nA transformation is a higher-order function of the form\n?pgqphqps, t, u, . . . q, ranging over relations s, t, u, . . . , with\nbehaviour determined by functions g and h, the higher-order\nparameters. A higher-order function has at least one function\nin either, or both, of its domain and codomain. Fig. 1 depicts\na prototypical transformation that applies ?pgqphq, for some\nfunctions g and h, to input relations s t, u, . . . to produce\noutput relation v.\ns\nt\nu\nv\n... ...\n\f\(g h q ì v.\nIn preparation for the de?nition of a data ?ow, we\nde?ne the \(reverse such that\npf1?f2qpxq ì f2pf1pxqq, where f1 : ? ﬁ— ? and f2 : ? ﬁ— ?\nare functions, and ?, ?, ? are types, with x having type ?. A\ndata ?ow is a composition of one or more transformations.\nA data ?ow ?1 ? ® ® ® ? ?k composed of k transformations\nis referred to as having size k. Each ?i, i ì 1, . . . , k, in\na size k data ?ow has an associated pair of functions, gi\nand hi that determine the transformation from the input\nrelations to the output relation. The single transformation in\nFig. 1 also constitutes a data ?ow of size 1 Compositions\nof ? with k ? 1 enable the representation of arbitrarily\ncomplex \(acyclic arbitrarily many input\nrelations and a single resulting output relation. All their\ntransformations, apart from the last one, each produce an\nintermediate relation. The order of a data ?ow is its total\nnumber of relations which is the sum of the input, output\nand intermediate relations.\nFig. 2 depicts an example data ?ow 3p?1psq,?2ptqq ì\nw, with intermediate relations u, v, size 3 and order 5. The\nmeaning of ?1 is de?ned by its higher-order parameters,\nph1qpg1q, shown as ?lter in Fig. 2 for readability. Similarly,\n?2ís parameters ph2qpg2q mean join and ?3ís ph3qpg3q mean\ngroup. The meaning of the overall data ?ow is to group the\nresult of a join of t with a ?ltered subset of s.\ns u\nt v w\n1\nlter\n2\njoin\n3\ngroup\nFigure 2: Flow ?3p?1psq,?2ptqq w.\nFig. 3 depicts an example MapReduce [7] data ?ow\n?5p?4p?1psqq,?4p?2psqq,?4p?2psqqq ì z, with interme-\ndiate relations t, u, v, x, y, size 7 and order 8. The meaning\nof ph1qpg1q, . . . , ph3qpg3q is split the data into one of three\npartitions, ph4qpg4q is map and ph5qpg5q is reduce. The\nmeaning of the overall data ?ow is a MapReduce from\ns to z. In contrast to Fig. 2, where the data ?ow is a\ntree with data ?owing from the leaves to the root, the\nMapReduce example is a directed acyclic graph \(DAG back together.\nHowever, semantically, Fig. 3 can be redrawn as a tree with\nrelation s occurring three times once each as the input to\nt, u and v. This underlying tree structure to the DAG is\nevident from the multiple appearances of s in the expression\n?5p?4p?1psqq,?4p?2psqq,?4p?3psqqq.\nt\ns u\nv\nw\nx\ny\nz\n5\nreduce\n1\nsplit\n2\nsplit\n3\nsplit\n4\nmap\n4\nmap\n4\nmap\nFigure 3: Flow 5p?4p?1psqq,?4p?2psqq,?4p?3psqqq ì z.\nWe now describe the higher-order parameters, g and h. In\na transformation ?pgqphqps, t, u, . . . q, generator function g\nranges over the transformationís input relations. The role of\ng is to enumerate the elements of sàtàuà . . . , assembling\nthem as the inputs to data constructor h, which constructs\nthe elements of the output relation. Generator g is chosen\nfrom t—,à, ?u, i.e map, product and lambda.\nFig. 4 depicts examples of two higher-order map trans-\nformations ?pgqphq, where generator function g ì —. In\n?p—qphqpsq ì v, the transformation applies h to the\nelements of s to construct the n ì |s| elements of v. In\n?p—qphqps, tq ì v, the transformation applies h to pairs\npsi, tiq, i ì 1 n, to construct the n ì |s| ì |t| elements\nof v. There is a bijection between each source relation and\nthe target relation v.\nFig. 5 depicts an example higher-order product trans-\nformation ?pgqphq, where generator function g ì à. The\ntransformation ?pàqphqps, tq ì v applies h to each element\nin s à t to construct the |s t| ì |s| ® |t| elements of v.\n570\nvs v\ns1\ns2...\nsn\nv1\nv2...\nvn\ns\nt\ns1\ns2...\nsn\nv1\nv2...\nvn\nt1\nt2\n...\ntn\nFigure 4: Higher-order transformations ?p—qphqpsq ì v,\nand ?p—qphqps, tq ì v.\ns v\nt\ns1\ns2\nt1\nt2\nt3\nv1\nv2\nv3\nv4\nv6\nv5\nFigure 5: Higher-order transformation ?pàqphqps, tq ì v.\nFig. 6 depicts an example higher-order lambda trans-\nformation ?pgqphq, where generator function g ì ?. The\nlambda transformation ?p?qphqpsq ì v applies h to each\nelement of the result of the application of a lambda expres-\nsion ? to each element of s, such that v ì tvk : vk ì\nhpxjq, xj P ?.si, si P su. The example assumes a lambda\nexpression that generates multiple elements vj P v from each\nsi P s. However, different lambda expressions could result\nin a single or even zero vj from each si. The number of\nvj generated from each si may vary. Also, more than one\nsi may generate \(or contribute to the value of between s and v. Thus, in the ex-\nample, it is not necessary that m ì o, nor that m, o, ® ® ® ? 0.\nIf tv1 vmu X tvm`1, . . . , vm`ou X ® ® ® â H.\nIn a transformation ?pgqphq, data constructor function h\nranges over the outputs of generator function g. Thus in the\ncase of g P t—,àu, the inputs to h will be elements from\nthe input relations to ?. In the case of g ì ?, the inputs to\nh can be sub-parts of the elements from the input relations\nto ?. The role of h is to construct the elements of the output\nrelation of the transformation The result of each invocation\nof h is an element in the output relation.\nIII. KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION\nOur data ?ow model follows the individuals-as-terms\nknowledge representation, a de-normalised 


generalisation\nvs\ns1\ns2...\nsn\nv1\nv2...\nvm\nvm+1\nvm+2\n...\nvm+o\n......\nFigure 6: Higher-order transformation p?qphqpsq ì v.\nof the relational modelís attribute-value representation, that\ncollects all information about an individual in a single\nterm \(or document the higher-order logic based on\nChurchís simple theory of types with several extensions [8].\nThe logic natively supports data types that are important\nfor representing individuals, including sets, multisets and\ngraphs. Strong typing helps to reduce search spaces and\nthe type of terms provides useful metadata. Also type\npolymorphism and type hierarchies are powerful tools in\nthe representation and processing of knowledge The theory\nbehind the logic and the individuals-as-terms formalism is\nset out in [8]. Although space does not permit its description\nhere, our data ?ows may be concisely described using basic\nterms as the representational formalism. Relations \(tables outer bags as\nde?ned in Pig may also be similarly expressed using this\nformalism [9] [10].\nIV. IMPLEMENTATION\nJSONMatch despite its name, is able to read, process\nand output a range of different data formats through its\nREST API including plain text, CSV, XML, YAML, \(Weka natively support basic terms, the following scheme\nintuitively affords their representation.\nÇ Basic Structures are represented as JSON arrays,\nwhere the ?rst element is the constant name. e.g.\nA tree representation of the list rA,B,Cs becomes\n["#",A,["#",B,["#",C,"[]"]]]. Lists may also be\nconveniently represented as JSON arrays.\nÇ Basic Abstractions, mappings from one basic term\nto another, are represented as JSON objects where\neach object value is a two-element array containing\nJSON representations of the basic terms. Each\nobject key is a string representation of the ?rst\nobject such that a bijection exists from key to the\n?rst basic term in the array. e.g. An abstraction\nt p3, 7q — 101, p2.5, 8q — 102 u becomes\n571\n{"\(3,7  2.5,8  of\nthe ?rst basic term to the key then, the object\nvalues are simply the JSON representation of\nthe term. e.g A set tìAî, ìBî, ìCîu becomes\n{"A":true, "B":true, "C":true}. Similarly, a\nmultiset t0, 0, 42, 42, 42u becomes 0":2, "42":3}.\nÇ Basic Tuples are represented as JSON arrays. e.g.\npìAî, ìBî, 3.14, 42q becomes A","B",3.14,42].\nÇ Types are either represented implicitly by their JSON\nprimitive types t string, number object, array, true,\nfalse, null u, or explicitly by pairing each value with a\nstring of its type name. e.g. A geolocation p51.46, 2.6q\nof type Geo ì Lat à Long becomes the JSON array\n[[[51.46,"Lat"], [2.6,"Long"]],"Geo or, if every\ntype name in a value is known to be unique, the JSON\nobject {"Geo":{"Lat":51.46, "Long":2.6}}.\nAn extension of the above scheme also enables declar-\native representation of the higher-order parameter h as\nprototypical JSON templates for the item, relation and\nlambda values. These templates are the JSON analogue of\nHTML templates used in web frameworks. Like HTML\ntemplates, JSON templates may include embedded function\napplications. Embedded functions are represented as JSON\narrays, where the ?rst element is the name of the function,\nas a string, and subsequent elements are the arguments\nof the function. JSONMatch has a library of built-in set,\nlist and text functions. Built-in functions all have names\nbeginning "jm designating the JSONMatch namespace.\nA trivial example is the function jm:length, which maps\na string to its length, e.g. ["jm:length", "abc"] will\nbe substituted with 3. Thus if embedded in the JSON\nobject {"x":"abc y":["jm:length", "abc"]} in some\ntemplate term, will result in {"x":"abc", "y":3}. Table I\nlists an illustrative selection of other built-in functions.\nEmbedded functions include JSONPath expressions to\naccess subterms of input items [11], although we disable\nJSONPathís web-unsafe evaluation of arbitrary functions in\nthe underlying language. JSONPath for JSON is similar\nto the better known XPath for XML but is substantially\nsimpler to learn and use. These inputs are available to path\nexpressions via an array, items, in an object called context.\nFor an n-ary transformation, items will have n elements:\neach one an item from the transformationís respective n\ninput relations. As syntactic sugar, JSONPath strings in\ntemplate terms are implicitly treated as path queries on the\ncontext object, e.g. "$.items[0].author.name" is treated\nas jm:path", "$.items[0].author.name", context].\nV. EXAMPLE DATA FLOWS\nWe present a real-world data ?ow example motivated by\nthe task of harvesting and pro?ling the DBLP Computer\nScience bibliography author pages of Programme Commit-\ntee \(PC FUNCTIONS\nFunction Description\njm:to_set Converts array/list to a set.\njm:to_multiset Converts array/list to a multiset.\njm:set_union Union of two sets.\njm:multiset_sum Sums the multiplicities of the union.\njm:apply Apply function to each element of a list.\njm:project Extract subterm from a basic term.\njm:types Detect types of all subterms of a basic term.\njm:http_get Fetches text of web page; or REST call.\njm:extract Substring matching a regular expression.\njm:remove_html Strips HTML mark-up from a string.\njm:downcase Converts a string to lower case.\njm:to_words Splits a string into a list of words.\njm:entities Recognises names of people, places etc.\njm:stem Replaces words with their Porter stem.\njm:ngrams Returns n-grams from a list of words.\njm:pgrams 


Returns p-spectrum of a list of words.\njm:prefixes Counts left substrings of a list of words.\njm:exclude_words Removes supplied ëstopwordsí from list.\njm:include_words Restricts words to supplied vocabulary.\njm:replace_words Substitutes words using supplied mapping.\njm:tfidf Calculates TF-IDF for a multiset of words.\njm:cosine Cosine similarity of term-weight vectors.\njm:kernel Kernel \(as a distance basic terms.\nExample HTTP requests and their parameters are denoted\nusing the format below. Examples will omit url>, the url\nof the JSONMatch web service \(e.g. http://localhost details of the security\ntoken needed in the HTTP request header.\n<http_method url>][<user_id>]<path>\n<parameter_name_1> = <parameter_value_1>\n<parameter_name_2 parameter_value_2>\n...\nThe input to the data ?ow is a CSV ?le with\nrows: <pc_member_name>, <url primary_keyword>,\n<keywords>. This can be loaded into JSONMatch to create\na basic relation called pc, with name as the item id, by:\nPOST /relations/pc\nas=csv\nid_path="$[0]"\nvalues=<text of csv file>\nThe resultant basic relation pc has items of type Id —\nName à Url à Primary à Keywords, all strings, and has the\nfollowing JSON representation \(abbreviated for brevity Feelders",\n"http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/f/F...",\n572\n"Rankings_and_Partial_Orders",\n"Active_Learning Bioinformatics; ..."\n],\n"Aditya_Menon": [...],\n"Alain_Rakotomamonjy": [...],\n...\n}\n]\nA map now converts relation pc to\nrelation pc2, which has items of type Id — String and\nincludes HTML fetched from each PC memberís DBLP\npage.\nPOST /relations/pc2/from/pc\ngenerator=map\nprototypes={\n"item": {\n"name items[0][0]",\n"url": "$.items[0][1]",\n"text": ["jm:http_get", "$.items[0][1]"],\n"primary items[0][2]",\n"keywords": "$.items[0][3]"\n}\n}\nAfterwards, each item in pc2 has the following form.\n"Ad_Feelders": {\n"name": "Ad Feelders",\n"url": "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/...",\n"text": "<html><title>A J. Feeld...</html>",\n"primary": "Rankings_and_Partial_Orders",\n"keywords": "Active_Learning Bioinforma..."\n}\nThe next map transformation constructs a multiset of word\n\(term obtained by stripping HTML\nmark-up from the text. For clarity we have omitted the\nadditional trivial functions calls to append all the keywords\nto the end of the text, convert the text to lower case, and\nappend 2-grams and 3-grams of all the words to the list prior\nto counting frequencies.\nPOST relations/pc3/from/pc2\ngenerator=map\nprototypes={\n"relation": {\n"corpus_n jm:multiset_sum",\n"$.folder.item[*].term_n"],\n"corpus_dt jm:multiset_increment",\n"$.folder.item[*].term_n"],\n"corpus_N": "$.arguments_size.[0]"\n},\n"item": {\n"name items[0].name",\n"url": "$.items[0].url",\n"primary": "$.items[0].primary",\n"keywords items[0].keywords",\n"term_n": ["jm:to_multiset",\n["jm:to_words jm:remove_html",\n"$.items[0].text"]]\n],\n"document_n": ["jm:multiset_cardinality",\n"$.item.term_n"]\n}\n}\nSome explanation of the relation template term is re-\nquired. The functions with dependencies on path expressions\ninvolving $.folder.item[*] are compiled by JSONMatch\nto evaluate after each itemís template term is evaluated. In\neffect, they serve as global accumulators and are a conve-\nnient shortcut to avoid the more parallelisable MapReduce\napproach to counting. To achieve scalability to large data,\nthis shortcut cannot be used.\nA ?nal map transformation then pro?les each author by\nadding a term \(word pairs, which\nis obtained by computing the TF-IDF weighted score for\nthe term_n multiset of word frequencies Optional extra\nfunctions can be used to sort, threshold and limit the number\nof pairs in the result.\nPOST relations/pc4/from/pc3\ngenerator=product\nprototypes={\n"relation": {\n"corpus_n jm:multiset_sum",\n["jm:project", "$[*][0,2]", "$.item.term"]],\n"corpus_dt jm:multiset_increment",\n["jm:project", "$[*][0]", "$.item.term"]]\n},\n"item": {\n"name items[0].name",\n"url": "$.items[0].url",\n"primary": "$.items[0].primary",\n"keywords items[0].keywords",\n"document_n", "$.items[0].document_n",\n"term jm:tfidf",\n"$.items[0].term_n",\n"$.items[0].document_n",\n"$.folders[0].corpus_dt",\n"$.folders[0].corpus_N"]\n n}\nThese pro?les in the item list may then be used in a\nproduct relations to\ncompute cosine similarities between the pro?le abstractions.\nIn recreating and extending the functionality of SubSift\nin JSONMatch, lambda preparation and transfer between\nthe systems - completely avoiding the need to write any\nmigration code. For lambda transformations, the function\njm:generate outputs a term constructed by evaluating the\nJSON template for each element in the list. The template\nmay itself contain embedded functions, evaluated against an\nimplicit local context that includes item, itself the result of\nthe application of a JSONPath expression to the current\nglobal context.\nOther useful applications of lambda generators include\nsplitting and grouping data. e.g. For a transformation on a\nrelation containing RSS blog data,\n{\n"item": ["jm:generate item",\n"$.items[0].rss.channel.item[*]"]\n}\n573\nwill emit a separate item for each channel item \(i.e. story 


in\nthe RSS feed. Note that the item in rss.channel.item[*]\nis an element name from the RSS schema and is unrelated to\nthe JSONMatch item value in the current context. The list\nof channel items produced by the above transformation can\nthen be grouped together by author, simply by generating\ninto item ëbinsí of the same id.\n{\n"item": ["jm:generate",\n["jm:push", "$.item", "$.old_item"],\n"$.items[0].rss.channel.item",\n{"id_path item.dc:creator",\n"unique_id": false, "fetch_item": true}\n]\n}\nThe function jm:push adds an item to the end of a list.\nHere the list is the previous value of the item already saved\nat this id, accessed through the local context old_item. The\noptional third argument to jm:generate contains id_path\nwhich speci?ed the id of the item to be created \(or updated fetch the old value of the item and make it\navailable as old_item. This idiom of merging or overwriting\nitems already generated is both ?exible and powerful. One\nuseful application is to produce Web 2.0 AJAX type-ahead\npredictive text look-up web service by generating items\nwhose ids are all the left substrings of a set of words,\nusing jm:prefixes. Such functionality normally requires a\nheavyweight text engine such as Apache Lucene.\nVI. SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK\nWe have introduced a higher-order data ?ow model and\ndata representational formalism based on basic terms in the\nhigher-order logic, which in combination are well suited to\nanalysing Big Variety data. The model supports highly paral-\nlelisable design patterns but we suggest that its main strength\nis in the elegance of its data-de?ned transformations. We also\nintroduced JSONMatch, a web services implementation of\nour framework that uses JSON to represent basic terms and\nJSONPath to access subterms JSONMatch has a wide range\nof potential applications, particularly in support of pro?ling\nand matching heterogeneous data as an integrated part of\nweb applications.\nTo date JSONMatch has been used to support similar use\ncases to the SubSift software, e.g. including reviewer recom-\nmendation for journals and conferences, but is enabling more\n?exibility in the design of similarity measures. For example,\nin the ECML/PKDD conference we produced a paper-\nreviewer similarity score by taking the linear combination of\nthree cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors representing text,\nprimary and secondary keywords. This required a bespoke\nchange to the SubSift software itself. Implementing this in\nJSONMatch did not require new code; the linear combi-\nnation was just calculated in the item template term. At\nthe same conference the JSONMatch approach to pro?ling\nJSON was used as the back-end of a mobile application\nfor personalised schedules. One feature of JSONMatch that\nhas interesting potential is that in addition to the default\n"jm:" namespace arbitrary additional namespaces may be\nregistered to enable embedding of user-de?ned functions\nimplemented as calls to external web services. In future we\nwill be applying JSONMatch to more complex data.\nREFERENCES\n[1 P. A. Flach, S. Spiegler, B. Gole¥nia, S. Price, J. G. Ralf,\nH. T. Graepel, and M. J.

all n subsets with\nthe same key range are stored on the same machine, hence\nthe missing subsets must be transferred to the corresponding\nmachine at the beginning of the map phase. Input partition\nselection and also post-processing in the reduce phase is the\nsame as for the 2-way join. The 2-way merge join algorithm\nin Algorithm 1 can be easily extended for n-way merge joins\nusing n interleaved linear scans instead of two However, a\ndisadvantage of the n-way join compared to a sequence of\n2-way joins is that we do not bene?t from bloom ?lters for\nintermediate results. Hence, we can only apply bloom ?lters\non the results of the n-way join if another join iteration\nfollows MapReduce iterations has a greater impact on query\nperformance than discarding dangling intermediate results.\nVI. EXPERIMENTS\nThe experiments were performed on a cluster of ten\nmachines equipped with a 6 core Xeon E5-2420 CPU \(1.9\nGHz Cloudera in version 4.2.1. We used\nthe well-known Lehigh University Benchmark \(LUBM  datasets from 500 up to 3000 universities where\nwe pre-computed the transitive closure using the WebPIE\ninference engine for Hadoop [16]. The store generation\nruntimes and dataset sizes are listed in Table I. We can\nobserve that the actual store size is even smaller than the\nsize of the original RDF graph. This is achieved by replacing\npre?xes and applying snappy compression which reduced the\noriginal dataset size by up to 92%.\n635\nTABLE I.

The crucial point for this choice was the\nsophisticated reduce-side join implementation of Pig [18 that\nincorporates sampling and hash join techniques.\nFigure 7 illustrates the scaling properties of our merge join\napproach. We can observe a linear scaling of query runtimes\nwhere tripling the dataset size does not even take twice the\ntime for most queries. A comparison of execution times \(wall\ntime summarized in Table II. MAPSIN\nlacks the support for LUBM queries 2, 9 and 10 whereas\nHadoopRDF runs out of storage space while creating its\nstorage schema for datasets larger than LUBM 20004. We\nconsidered a time-out of one hour, denoted by T, if a query\nfails to complete in time.\nQueries 6 and 14 are simple and require no join at all.\nNevertheless, our approach outperforms the other systems\nsigni?cantly as the whole processing is done locally on all\ncluster machines without any reduce phase. One may expect\nMAPSIN to be the fastest for such queries, since a single table\nlookup could provide the ?nal result. However, such a request\nwould push the result to only one machine violating the scaling\nproperties. Therefore, MAPSIN processes such single pattern\nqueries by a distributed table scan which is executed on each\nmachine preserving scalability.\nQueries 1, 3, 5 and 13 contain only one join. Our approach\nprocesses these queries within a single map phase as no\nadditional processing for a subsequent join is required. Overall,\nthe merge join performs best for these kind of queries.\nQuery 2 is rather complex \(compared to other LUBM\nqueries pattern structure. Moreover,\nit contains a costly and unselective subject-object and object-\nsubject join that points out a weakness of our approach. As\nboth join partitions must use the same key ranges, one of the\ninput partitions is fairly unbalanced \(cf. Section IV point of\nfuture work to develop more sophisticated sampling strategies\nfor key ranges to improve data distribution for such cases.\nQueries 7, 8 and 9 demonstrate the base case where several\njoins have to be processed sequentially. For these queries, the\nreduce phase is required to sort the join output according to the\n4We contacted the authors since neither a documentation nor an ìout-of-the-\nboxî running system was available, unfortunately we didnít get any support.\n500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\n175\n#universities\nru\nnt\nim\ne\n\(s\n 3000\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n#universities\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7\nQ8 Q9 Q10 Q11 Q13 Q14\nFig. 7. Runtimes for all LUBM queries \(Merge Join intermediate results. For queries 7 and 8 we\ncan observe a quite competitive performance of our approach\ncompared to both reduce-side join based systems. Indeed, such\nselective queries are the core of MAPSIN, where it bene?ts\nfrom its index structure accessing only those triples that are\nrelevant for the query answer. Nonetheless, query runtimes of\nMAPSIN are close to the runtimes of the merge join approach.\nQuery 4 is a star pattern query which makes it a good\ncandidate for n-way joins. Figure 8.a illustrates a 


comparison\nbetween 2-way and n-way execution for Merge Join, MAPSIN\nand PigSPARQL as these systems support n-way joins. In all\ncases, n-way joins clearly outperform a sequential execution of\n2-way joins, while the bene?t for our merge join approach is\nless than for the others. Reducing the amount of MapReduce\ncycles comes at the cost of more data that has to be processed\nat once. As we cannot guarantee that all n matching subsets\nreside on the same machine, more data has to be accessed\nremotely. This is underpinned by Figure 8.b that shows the\namount of data accessed locally and retrieved remotely within\na map-side merge join. However the difference is much less\nthan expected. Processing query 4 with one 5-way merge join\ncompared with several 2-way merge joins increases the amount\nof data retrieved remotely by only 32% while decreasing the\namount of data accessed locally by 34%. This can be explained\ndue to the fact that data is stored with an replication factor\nof three which increases the chances that matching subsets\nreside on the same machine. Except for n-way joins, the\namount of data accessed locally within a merge join is always\nhigher than the amount of data retrieved remotely, which is\nan expected behavior since we choose the larger dataset to be\nprocessed locally Nevertheless, since data locality is a crucial\npoint for distributed systems, improving these values, e.g by\na re?nement of the data placement strategy wrt. matching\nsubsets, is a worthwhile point for future optimizations.\nThe average performance bene?t of our Merge Join com-\npared to the other systems is between 15 and 48%. In order\nto compare the performance of the different systems we com-\nputed for each query the relative difference of execution time to\nthe respective best case. Then, for each system the average of\nthese relative differences over all queries is computed, whereas\nmissing measure points are replaced with a weak penalty value.\nThe penalty is based on the average of all systems that perform\nworse than the best execution time. Finally, we computed the\nrelative performance distance of other systems to our approach\n\(c.f. ìrelative perf.î in Table II 72 in\ncomparison with Merge Join \(100 JOIN, MAPSIN, PIGSPARQL AND HADOOPRDF IN SECONDS.

It works best for single join queries but performs\nalso good for sequences of joins. However, unselective subject-\nobject or object-subject joins turned out to be a weak point,\nespecially if one join input side is fairly unbalanced. But\neven for those queries, the differences to the fastest query\nexecution times are still acceptable while showing an excel-\nlent scaling behavior at all time. Moreover, our store layout\nenables retrieving one pattern queries even faster than the\nindex-based query execution of MAPSIN. Taken into account\nthat improving data locality by adopting more suitable data\nplacement strategies for Hadoop and preventing unbalanced\npartitions by more sophisticated partitioning strategies will\nfurther improve query execution times, we can conclude that\nmap-side merge joins are well suited for processing SPARQL\nBGPs with MapReduce.\nVII. RELATED WORK\nIn terms of mere query performance, RDF-3X [19] has\nestablished itself as the state-of-the-art ìbenchmark engine\nfor single place machines. However, its performance has been\nshown to degrade for queries with unbound objects and low\nselectivity factors [5]. Furthermore, with the ever increasing\namount of available RDF data single machine solutions for\nquery processing become more and more challenging [4].\nThus, a number of systems that focus on distributed execution\nof SPARQL queries have been proposed in recent years\n\(e.g. [20], [21 22 synergy effects by reusing already deployed frame-\nworks. Our research is driven by the idea to reuse 


existing\ninfrastructures for ìBig Dataî scenarios. Consequently, we\nhave ensured that no changes to the underlying Hadoop\nframework are required to run our SPARQL BGP engine. This\nway, existing Hadoop clusters or cloud services \(e.g. Amazon\nEC2 driver for\nthe performance of SPARQL BGP evaluation, and thus we\nhave focused on join processing in MapReduce in this paper.\nThis topic has already been studied considering various aspects\nand application ?elds [23 24], [13], [25], [26]. In [25] the\nauthors discussed how to process arbitrary joins \(? joins using\nMapReduce, whereas [23] focuses on optimizing n-way joins.\n? joins are not required for the evaluation of SPARQL BGPs,\nand they are not supported by our solution. The execution\nof n-way joins is a generalization of our 2-way join, where\ninstead of two all n pre-sorted input partitions are processed\nin a single map phase Map-Reduce-Merge [26] describes a\nmodi?ed MapReduce work?ow by adding a merge phase after\nthe reduce phase whereas Map-Join-Reduce [24] proposes\na join phase in between the map and reduce phase. Both\ntechniques attempt to improve the support for joins in MapRe-\nduce but require profound modi?cations to the MapReduce\nframework. In [27] the authors present non-invasive index and\njoin techniques for SQL processing in MapReduce that also\nreduce the amount of shuf?ed data at the cost of an additional\nco-partitioning and indexing phase at load time. However, the\nschema and workload is assumed to be known in advance\n637\nwhich is typically feasible for relational data but does not hold\nfor RDF in general. HadoopDB [28] is a hybrid of MapReduce\nand DBMS where MapReduce is the communication layer\nabove multiple single node DBMS. The authors in 4] adopt\nthis hybrid approach for the Semantic Web using RDF-3X.\nInitially, they partition the graph on a single machine in a\nloading phase. We also initially store the dataset wrt. different\nsort orders but we employ the MapReduce framework to par-\ntition the dataset at loading time. Common to both approaches\nis that data has to be reloaded in case of updates, while we do\nnot require the installation of additonal engines at each cluster\nnode. HadoopRDF [5] is a MapReduce based RDF system\nthat stores data directly in HDFS and does also not require\nany changes to the Hadoop framework. It is able to rebalance\nautomatically when cluster size changes but join processing\nis also done in the reduce phase. As already mentioned, our\njoin processing is done in the map phase and additionally\nwe reduce the amount of data sent over the network by pro-\nactively ltering dangling tuples using bloom ?lters.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn the area of ìBig Dataî applications MapReduce has\nbecome a state-of-the-art technology for large-scale data pro-\ncessing. On the other side, the advent of the Semantic Web pro-\nmotes the growing adoption of RDF and SPARQL as its core\ntechnologies, raising attention for distributed SPARQL query\nprocessing in current research. As basic graph patterns, which\nare at the core of SPARQL, translate to the computation of\njoins on the operator level, ef?cient distributed join techniques\nfor RDF are of particular interest. The ?xed ternary structure\nof RDF makes it a well suited candidate for sort-merge joins\nas presorting the data is affordable. In this paper we presented\nan adaptation of sort-merge joins for SPARQL basic graph\npatterns with MapReduce which supports both 2-way and n-\nway joins The actual join computation is completely done\nin the map phase, complemented by bloom ?lters to discard\ndangling intermediate results, while the reduce phase is used\nto post-process the join output for subsequent join iterations.\nOur experiments with the LUBM bechmark demonstrated an\naverage performance bene?t between 15% and 48% of our\napproach compared to other MapReduce based systems while\nscaling smoothly with the dataset size. For future work, we\nwill consider re?nements of the data placement strategy to\nfurther optimize data locality as well as techniques to handle\ndata skew in parallel joins.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the ìgold standardî \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
