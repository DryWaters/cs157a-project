C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper 1354 Version 3 Updated October 23 2007 to communication constraints From an unconstrainedresources viewpoint it is desirable to use the complete set of deployed sensors however that generally results in an excessive data volume Selecting 
a subset of sensors to participate in a sensing task is crucial to satisfying tradeoffs between accuracy and time-line requirements For emitter location it is well-known that the geometry between sensors and the target plays a key role in determining the location accuracy Furthermore the deployed sensors have different data quality Given these two factors it is no trivial matter to select the optimal subset of sensors We propose various approaches to this problem and discuss trade-offs between them The first method assumes that the 
sensors have pre-paired and share their data between these pairs sensor selection then consists of selecting pairs to optimize performance while meeting constraints on number of pairs selected The second method consists of optimally determining pairings as well as selections of pairs but with the constraint that no sensors are shared between pairs The third method consists of allowing sensors to be shared between pairs We discuss several aspects of these three methods The first method is simple to solve but clearly the pre-pairing requirement makes this method clumsy and 
very suboptimal In the second method it is simple to evaluate the Fisher information but is challenging to make the optimal selections of sensors However in the third method things are reversed in that it is more challenging to evaluate the Fisher information but is simple to make the optimal selections of sensors Our general interest is in achieving network-wide optimization over a large number of simultaneously deployed sensors to enable more efficient and effective cooperation within the network of sensors We consider the specific 
scenario of using the sensors to locate a non-cooperative RF emitter by TDOA/FDOAbased methods here TDOA refers to Time-Difference-ofArrival and FDOA to Frequency-Difference-of-Arrival which can be jointly estimated by cross-correlating signals from a pair of the sensors The accuracy of the TDOA/FDOA estimates depends on the signal SNR and the time-frequency structure of the intercepted signal however the accuracy of the location estimation depends also on the emitter/sensor geometry The goal of our work is to 1 


optimize over the set of all sensor assets under the constraint of limited network communication resources 2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION For simplicity we consider only the 2-D geometrical scenario In the scenario we consider a rough estimate of emitter location has already been made either by our system or by a cueing system As shown in Figure 1 we wish to find the location of a stationary emitter denoted by u Xe Ye  using signals intercepted at N unmanned aerial vehicle UAV sensors denoted SI to SN whose positions are x xi,yj]T and speeds are i k,yj2]T for i=1,2,...,N  i  ril ri,2 CLi  f i  1 iXi1 uif2 X 2i C 2 where u k is the unit vector pointing from the kth sensor in the ith pair to the emitter for k 04 S6 S3 t s,i IS S4 J Figure 1 Geometry for stationary source location c Type-III T Figure 2 Three types of sensor network Let ri denote the Euclidean distance between the emitter and the ith sensor Si that is ri  u  Xi Xe Yi Ye 1 To compute the TDOA/FDOA measurements the sensors must be paired We consider three types of pairings within the network of sensors as shown in Figure 2 1 Type-I No Sensor Sharing two pairs that do not share a sensor are said to be independent pairs 2 Type-Il De-Centralized Sensor Sharing i.e sensors are shared between pairs but no sensor is part of more than two pairs 3 Type-III Centralized Sensor Sharing i.e a common reference sensor is used For the ith pair of sensors the TDOA Ti and FDOA i between the signals received at the two sensors in the pair are given by Assume there are Al pairs totally Let 0m Tk kj T be the parameter vector to be estimated by the mih pair of sensors which is paired by km  and im  sensors where m  1 2  M and km jm IE 1 2  N}Ikm im Let kj and kj be the estimates AT\\k.j and Awo,.j be the estimation errors then J J 3 S S  b Type-IT S3 s 1 St SI S2 S2 S3 0 0 S6  a Type-I  1,2 and fe is the transmitted frequency of the transmitter assumed estimated in advance o SI A Ao Because the estimate Om is obtained by maximum likelihood ML estimator 3 the asymptotic properties of ML estimators 4 gives that the PDF of it is Gaussian with covariance matrix that is the inverse of the Fisher information matrix FIM so A,m  N\(O Fl-l A mjm 4 As we know FIm depends only on the sensors received signals according to 4 2 S.-41 Qk u  S S4  IIV S5  I S1,40

4 SIMULATION RESULTS To demonstrate the capability of the sensor selection methods we present some simulation results for the case of locating an emitter with a random lay-down of 14 sensors The sensor selection proceeds as follows Each sensor intercepts the emitter signal data at SNRs in the range of 10-15dB where the SNR variation is assumed to depend quadratically on the range to the emitter The full set of sensors share a very small amount of data to obtain a rough estimate of the emitter location alternatively we could consider the case where the system is cued by some other sensor system that provides a rough location that is to be improved using our sensors Figure 5 shows the performance of sensor selections without sensor sharing We select 6 to 14 sensors to make 3 to 7 pairs shown on the horizontal axis The vertical axis shows the standard deviation of the geo-location error versus the number of sensors/pairs selected The upper curve A shows the performance for the pre-paired sensor case without sharing the lower curve O shows the performance when using the selection and pairing method discussed above for the case of no sensor sharing Not surprisingly the ability to select the pairing on the basis of the sensor geometry and the rough emitter location enables better performance than using pre-paired sensors Time Consumption of Sensor Pairing 50 o C Dynamic Programming U 30 4A Enumerating 260 00 40 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 number of sensors selected Figure 6 Time consumption of sensor pairing without sharing Figure 7 shows the performance of sensor selections allowing sensor sharing We select 5 to 11 sensors from 12 to make 4 to 10 pairs It also shows the standard deviation of the geo-location error versus the number of sensors/pairs selected The upper curve A shows the performance for the pre-paired sensor case with sharing the lower curve O shows the performance using our selection and pairing method with sharing that is based on the Theorem in Section 3.2 5 DISCUSSION 3 0 2.5  2 C C 05 1.5 M 0.03 A 0.025 0.02 A A 0.015 5 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 Number of sensors selected Figure 7 Performance of sensor selection allowed sharing 5 3.5 I'10A 0m 1 0.5 Standard Deviation of Location Estimation O FIM Pairing A Pre-Pairing A A 0Q6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Number of sensors selected Figure 5 Performance of sensor selection w/o sharing Figure 6 shows the time consumption used in pairing sensors for the non-sharing case versus the number of sensors/pairs selected The upper line A shows the time required for the enumeration-based method the lower one O shows the time required for our selection and pairing method These time results are for matlab-based implementations The results above show that it is possible to select and pair an optimal subset of sensors while significantly retaining performance levels The sensor selection optimization problem was based on the fact that the geometry property and data quality of sensors play important roles in the emitter location estimation We have used Fisher information to capture this inter-play between data quality and geometry We have discussed different situations i pre-paired sensors vs optimally pairing the sensors and ii allowing shared sensors or not Following are some general conclusions made from this work Standard Deviation of Location Estimation 0.065 0.06 iPlre-saPairing 0.055 O 0.05 0.0450.035
