Conclusions can be drawn from the results of simulation and experiment that measurement precision and repeat precision of two-probe method is a little higher that of single-probe method. Though radial random errors can not be separated entirely, the measurement theory of symmetrical configuration two-probe method is simple, and the measurement equipments’ precision can be easily ensured. In addition, the data processing can be done directly in timedomain, which is more practicable. Two-probe method is useful in practical measurement. High accuracy can be ensured especially in the case of measuring the shape errors of big parts with general precision Keywords- symmetrical configuration two-probe method; error separation; simulation analysis; experiment results I   I NTRODUCTION  Error separation technique is a potential technique which has been highly developed since about forty years ago. It is very useful in measuring and compensating the work-piece being machined online. Recently, the studies of error separation of cylindrical parts are mostly focused on multiprobes method. Theoretically, with more probes being used the harmonic loss in the resultant signals will be less, but actually, the manufacture and installation and adjustment of the probes’ clamps will be much more difficult in that case, and hence the precision is not easily ensured. Further more, it is difficult to estimate a good many experiment results impersonally, so multi-probes method is impractical and is not used widely The principle of two-probe method is simple, and the precision of the measurement equipments is easily ensured, and the data processing can be done directly in time domain. This method is practical and should be paid much attention to However, there just have been a few studies on two-probe method. One reason of that is two-probe method causes much harmonic loss in frequency domain. In addition, the initial values of the shape errors must be assumed in advance in the recurrence formulas of the time domain non-symmetrical configuration two-probe method. It is difficult to estimate the initial values and theoretical errors are inevitable, which affects the precision of the model 1 The time domain symmetrical configuration two-probe method can only improve the precision of the single probe method to a certain extent, but is not capable of separating nonrecurring random errors of each revolution There have been some studies on the practicability conditions of error separation of multi-probe and new accomplishments are being published now and again 2 The study of time domain non-symmetrical configuration twoprobe method will be provided in some other paper.

  4 individuals identified the use of system architecture as tool to preserve information for future modification \226 in effect, a method for configuration control and documentation.  A smaller subset identified the possibility of using system architecture as a construct for gathering, storing and maturing information to assist a spacecraft development This view aligns more with architecture as early and maturing design \226 the system blueprints A summary of objectives fo r a Space S&T architecture based on the responses is documented below 225 Preserve critical system development information.  S&T missions must ensure that the \223as-built\224 system information issues encountered and lessons learned are preserved to help enable subsequent efforts that are derived from the concepts that are demonstrated 225 Provide a communication tool to coordinate and integrate critical programmatic and technical information among the various system stakeholders throughout the development process 225 Implement a construct for identifying how information from various program elements should be matured over time to result in a system that meets its mission objectives  All individuals surveyed felt that boundaries should follow functional lines, but also felt that there was significant information about other systems that needed to be preserved to have the appropriate amount of context. The Venn diagram in Figure 2 illustrate s the typical S&T boundaries with the research in this paper on the space vehicle However, the other components of the system cannot be ignored especially in the early stages of design where mission requirements are developed and functional responsibilities are allocated to various components One of the other insights from system developers was the need to synergize an y architecture with the work that was being conducted in support of the design.  Architecture needed to keep pace with the maturation of the development g   As a result, the goals associated with this implementation system architecture were to use products that are commonly created throughout the system acquisition process, and make them more effective by highlighting their role in the development with the use of the reference model Throughout process of cross referencing program documentation with DoDAF model descriptions it also became clear that in several cases existing documentation could satisfy more than one view within the DoDAF construct.  This can be a very effective way of keeping the architecture a manageable size However, attention needs to be paid during the document development process to ensure that expectations for the information are properly framed to ensure the desired outcomes are achieved.  If a given product is going to include or be labeled as a \223DoDAF model\224, the requirements for what data should be contained within the model still must be adhered to.  The goal of this approach is not intended to re-define existing models.   It is meant to offer streamlined methods for model development and maintenance of relevant views.  This can be accomplished by ensuring the various DoDAF model data definitions and requirements in Volume II are referenced and checked during the document development and editing  Throughout the development of architecture significant attention was paid to what information was required to achieve the purpose outlined above.  As a result, several 223Fit For Purpose or FFP\224 views were created to help identify program and system information that DoDAF construct did not expressly identify.  This tailoring process is strongly encouraged by the new guidance to help increase the relevance of the architectur e to the stakeholders based on their input The following sub-sections will chronologically step through the development process and discuss how a tailored system architecture may assist the invested parties in more effectively achieving all desired outcomes Pre-Systems Acquisition At the onset of an S&T mission many decisions will have a profound outcome on the acquisiti on, and need to be made quite early in the lifecycle.  In this phase many decisions are made quickly and may be communicated in an \223ad hoc\224 fashion not allowing parties who subsequently join the development to appreciate the impetus.  This underscores the criticality for program tools that help develop understanding regarding the system, its associated risks, and technical challenges.   As can be seen in the process diagram \(Figure 3\he decision to pursue a mission is made, contractual and system development processes immediately follow.  If these decisions and processes are not well defined and documented they will delay subsequent requirements analysis and development activities  Space Vehicle Launch Vehicle Payload  Ground Segment Figure 2.

  5 At this point in the mission ther e are several areas that have been identified where system architecture products and processes could help mature expectations for different elements of the program appropriately before a \223mission acceptance\224 decision is made.  Table 2 lists relevant architecture information that was identified throughout this research and highlights rationale for the product as well as maturity.  The following section examines the purpose for the various views and attempts to illustrate how their presence could provide valuable technical and programmatic insight to support decision making Consolidated Risk Plan FFP-1A\ and List \(FFP-1B 227 The risk plan outlines the strategy for risk management scoring and defines a risk posture for the program.  The list provides an integrated view of all the risks within the system in order to effectively identify, manage and mitigate risks effectively.  Many S T missions are willing to accept more program risks due to the finite nature of the mission For example many S&T missions accept single string designs which immediately set a certain risk posture for the program.   By defining major program risks early it helps to set a frame of reference fo r acceptable risk within the program throughout the program and makes it easier to understand what level of risks must be mitigated during the design phase  or conversely can be accepted Mission Plan \(AV-1, OV-1, OV-4, StdV-1 227  During the pre-acquisition phase, a Mission Plan is a common umbrella document that summarizes the approach for the mission, the organizati ons that will be involved and the outcomes that are desired.  This document can take various forms and contain di ffering information depending on the developing organization.  While polling individuals regarding this mission phase th e areas discussed below were highlighted as items that needed to be documented at the onset of a mission Mission Life. In many cases expectations for mission life are not clearly defined or adhered to for S&T missions Following a successful S&T demonstration, perceptions may exist to use the residua l space capability operationally Developers need to clearly st ate what type of system is desired and not force artificial expectations for design robustness that exceed the actual need Mission Expectations, Outcomes & Measures of Effectiveness. S&T missions do not uniformly have a process for measuring the success of a technology on-orbit The mission plan must identify how success will be managed to ensure that it appropriately flows into the design.  In many cases mission requirements such as higher than planned payload duty cycles or 100% data collection at the ground emerge in later phases.  If these are not appropriately defined before mission segment requirements documentation is formulated than the appropriate capability may not exist Standards. Common problems encountered within S&T developments are how certain standards should be applied to achieve the desired outcomes.  In many cases the programmatic effects are not appropriately considered when a decision of how to apply a standard is made. For example decisions regarding piece part procurement standards can drive component piece part procurement cost by as much as six times  as well as have significant effects on lead time for procurement based on availability and requirements [8  These decisions need to be closely evaluated and framed with desired mission outcomes and risks tolerances for a project to strike a successful balance.  This needs to be done prior to mission acceptance to avoid costly mis-conceptions and delays during the requirements decomposition and design phases Furthermore many decisions at this point can become a function of prior precedent and that may or may not be appropriate for the outcomes that are desired for the mission at hand.  Programs may unnecessarily levy over restrictive cleanliness requirements that will result in significant extra time being spent, handling and cleaning Waiver Authority. It is equally as important to define processes for requesting waiver s to any approved standards by understanding the regulatory processes that surround them and identifying waiver authorities. In many cases waiver authorities do not reside within the program office i.e Form 813 Environmental Assessments some standards and regulations are unable to be waived so compliance must be achieved in the mission design Naturally, waivers occurring after established baselines would require a management procedure to control and document the new baseline Integrated Milestone Schedule \(PV-2 227  Prior to making the decision to embark in on a mission, it is also critical to define the elements of a program that will challenge or constrain the trad e space in terms of schedule Some elements of the mission are bound to constraint the program, such as long lead items and those on the critical path.  Common understanding of how that will affect the development needs to be done at the earliest stages of the program Some components in common small satellite designs routinely drive the ability to begin system integration.  The procurement of a SGLS transponder is a perfect example Acquisition time for a transponder is typically on the order of 16 months.  This is primarily due to the fact that specific crystals must be grown that correspond to an approved radio frequency.  The process to obtain approval for a specific frequency is also a lengthy process which will drive schedule risk.  Therefore in order to achieve system

This view can help an individual understand where information resides, as well as how it will mature through the course of a development.  This product should be have the widest distribution throughout the program so all invested parties understand the plan for documentation evolution Open System Trades \(FFP-3 227  From the onset of concept development in the various system areas trades emerge as the vision for the mission is constructed.  These trades will have widely different time horizons for decision making.  It is important within a development to ensure that all open trades are known and when closure must be achieved is well understood.  This can help avoid hasty time based decision making that isn\222t well coordinated or documented.  In many cases subsystem engineers do not fully consider the ramifications of how design changes within their system will affect other systems. An Open System Trade list and description will help mitigate issues during system integration and testing Secondary benefits of this view include ensuring consensus by all required parties, providing useful insight leading to major program reviews, and supporting decisions regarding the amount of outstanding work An example of how this product can be useful throughout the design phase of the acquisition occurred during the development of a flight softwa re system.  In this case the flight software engineering team made the decision to not implement the concurrent ability to range and receive telemetry without consulting the larger systems engineering ground operations and telecom engineering teams.  This implementation has serious implications for operations especially in an early orbit anomalous situation post launch where the ability to see telemetry and range on the vehicle would be highly desirable.  Given the programs significant time constraints, there was no ability to go back and redesign this capability once the disconnect was uncovered Therefore the team will have to work with this architecture and develop procedures to address this in the event of an anomaly.  A product which tracked trades like this and forced concurrence before an implementation was approved would have been useful for the agency responsible for the acquisition Concept Refinement Concept refinement and requirements development is often a challenging phase of any system development.  In a very short period of time the program must adequately define their requirements for the system and the developer is expected to understand, refine, decompose, and allocate all of the requirements for a given system.  Within the space S&T realm, like many advanced technology efforts, this is often done with high levels design uncertainty among system elements.  Figure 4 documents this phase Sound requirements development and refinement is a cornerstone of a development\222s success.  However, in many instances this phase of the mission has been plagued by poor documentation and systems engineering.  This underscores the need for information that can help the system developer and/or the program decision authority with ways to effectively st ructure and document decisions throughout this phase There are two distinct efforts within this phase.  The first is the acquiring agency articulating what is required of the system under development.  This effort should heavily leverage and refine many of the architecture views outlined in the previous phase in particular the Mission Plan.  As can be seen in Table 3, effort ear ly in this phase is geared towards ensuring that the mission needs, outcomes and standards are completely articulated.  This ultimately results in the delivery of a Space Vehicle Technical Requirements Document to the system developer A strong emphasis throughout the beginning of this phase should be to solicit feedback from external agencies. In many instances this coordination can allow for more current requirements or standards to be applied and included prior to delivery to the developer thus avoiding confusion and iteration later in the design review process.  Once this information is coordinated, it should culminate in the delivery of a comprehensive technical requirements document being delivered to the developer in order to convey system requirements in fashion that allow for the agency to fully evaluate the merits of a design Following the acceptance of a system requirements document, it is the responsibility of the developer to begin the process of reviewing, refine, decomposing and allocating the requirements to the various subsystems.   This is an effort intensive process given the complex interfaces between various systems. For this reason, a common understanding of what constitute s a complete requirements baseline is a useful benchmark for both the system owner and the developer by creating an set of expectations to evaluate the completion of this phase Mission Plan \(AV-1, OV-1, OV-4, STDV-1 227  This update should be focused on clarifying any changes or omissions to the critical system requirements, outcomes and standards.  The revision of this document should be well circulated with external agen cies to ensure that properly regulatory guidance and best practices are implemented. In

  10  SV Technical Requireme nts Document \(FFP-3 227 Following the validation of critical outcomes and standards the acquiring agency should release a comprehensive systems requirements document that elaborates on the desired outcomes for the system by detailing significant system and subsystem requirements.  Some may suggest that this element is not required and it should be the responsibility of the developer to derive from the required capabilities and outcomes. However, in most cases, the agency has expectations for design development and test.  If the developer is expected to derive system or test requirements without the guidance that a comprehensive requirements document would provide there is likely to be serious discrepancies in the approaches taken with respect to requirements and standards A good example of this can be seen in the development practices for the Space Test Program.  The Space Test Program will commonly take risks in accepting a single string spacecraft design due to mass and volume constraints associated with their space lif t opportunities. However, in order to mitigate that risk, rigorous test requirements which may not be typically required for an S&T such as full MILSTD 1540-E are commonly levied to screen for workmanship issues and infant mortality.  Without these detailed specifications being documented in a technical requirements document to the developer it is unlikely that they would adopt the preferred approach.  This would result in extra time and cost expended in order to come to a consensus Space Vehicle System Specification \(FFP-4 227  This view represents the complete set of requirements associated with the system and the methods that will be used to demonstrate this requirement.  The requirements specification should demonstrate how requirements are organized at the system, sub-system and component levels Recommendations for how to construct this view are well documented in some Data Item Descriptions \(DID\s proposed formatting does allo w for tailoring and does not have specific requirements associated with how the document is prepared or managed.  However, careful consideration should be paid to the approach that is taken Several tools exist that make use of databases to allow the user and the developer to trace requirements compliance from the component to the syst em level.  This capability significantly enhances the ability to work with the information and assess changes as they are encountered throughout the design process.  This is important in the S&T environment because it allows the individuals associated with design trades to more effectively understand the impacts of change throughout the development process These lessons can be applie d into final interface control documentation and used to assess overall suitability entering the review.  If there are issues encountered during these activities, mitigations should be developed prior to a final design review in order to ensure that developers can successfully transition from design to integration at completion of the review.  These steps will help all parties validate the design and give them the requisite data to make informed decisions when planning for later phases of the mission  Preliminary System Design  The name for this phase can be somewhat of a misnomer Even though the first iterations of the design process is made, there are many elements which need to be completely solidified at this point in the design process.  Additionally this tends to be the point in the project where detailed interface boundaries and specifica tions must be developed among sub-systems and systems As can be seen in Figure 5, much of the effort expended throughout this phase is dedicated to resolving various design decisions and trades.  Tools that assist both the program developer and procuring agency add structure and organization to this time are particularly important.  Many of the systems architecture products that were mentioned previously \(i.e. schedule and CDRL list\in the chapter play a significant role in aiding this process The preliminary design phase is unique because although the review marks the closure of the phase, some milestones that are of equal or greater importance must occur before this happens.  As individual subsystem and system designs emerge and component trades for the various systems are developed, it becomes apparent that orders must be placed before the any design review occurs. This is to have longlead products delivered by the close of the design phase This can be very difficult b ecause, usually, the components that fall into this category are some of the most important system elements \(avionics flight computers and transceivers additional challenge for the systems engineering team to ensure the requirements and interfaces for the component and the systems are properly vetted.   This is where the program can heavily leverage system architecting products.   Table 4 lists the relevant architectural information for this phase System Subsystem Design Specific ations \(DIV-3, SV-5, OV6A, SV-10B 227  At the culmination of this phase the initial design for each subsystem and the system as a whole should be well understood.  Several Aerospace reference documents detail all of the pertinent design elements for the various subsystems.  However, what is often not seen are common views for how the information should be represented among the various subsystems ensuring that the approach the various developers have for conveying information translates well from subsystem to subsystem.  This is not to say that each presentation needs to be structured identically

  12 Table 5. Recommended Design Review Common Views Design Review Information Purpose Physical Functional View  This view would illustrate all of the components within the system and highlight their functional responsibility within the system as a whole.  If the system was software intensive, component references may be less important than identifying the software tasks and their relationship within the system   This view\(s\the different operating states or modes of the system Data Transfer View Demonstrate how data moves throughout the subsystem/system in both hardware and software. Illustrate the various ways that format is altered in the process Reliability Views Analysis\222 showing sub-system reliability and the supporting data/methods implemented Subsystem and component flight heritage pedigree Identify any limited life items within the system to properly identify constraints and risks associated with the development Technical Budgets Performance View Identify the system requirements and the expected design performance, demonstrate that design has sufficient margin per industry standards \(AIAA\given level of maturity Define the level of analysis/ simulation required to demonstrate the suitability of systems  At first glance it can be seen that the views suggested by various SMEs closely resemble the various DoDAF2.0 viewpoints.  This suggests that the recommended views address the different aspects of design from a fairly complete set of perspectives  Interface control documents al so need to be reviewed carefully in order to ensure that the proper information is included within the document.  In several instances ambiguous references to existing standards have resulted in compatibility problems.  Specifically, when selecting command and telemetry data protocols. particular attention needs to be paid to ensure the view completely demonstrates the planned implementation.  In the recent past, references to standards such as CCSDS have given system developers the false security that a format is well understood.  Away to eliminate such ambiguities is to include sample data references in the views that can be reviewed and decomposed by the receiving agency to ensure that a consensus is reached  Operational Environments \(FFP-7 227   A critical element of component and system design is finalizing the environmental conditions that the space vehicle will experience throughout launch and upon separation.  This can be complicated in the S&T environment, because there ar e instances where acquisition begins without a complete understanding of what launch vehicle environments will be experienced.  Regardless whether or not this is known, a best effort needs to be made to indentify an enveloping environment for testing as early as possible.  In many instan ces insufficient testing can put undue risk to testing at the sp ace vehicle and drive cost later in the program.  Also, incorrect assumptions regarding notching can lead to potential susceptibilities.  The acquiring agency should strive to define environment at the launch vehicle interface before any requirements are flown for component level testing.  This will pay large dividends later in the program by avoiding very extensive and costly tests and analysis later in the program.  If there is some level of uncertainty that cannot be resolved prior to component level procurement, the acquiri ng agency must either accept the risk or plan for significant cost growth later in the program.  Documentation that details the tests environments for each component and the test methods used for verification will help in baselining expectations.  A matrix that identifies verification me thods will help ensure that there is consensus is an e ffective method for accomplishing this  A satellite failure demonstrates an example of what can occur if environments aren\222t well understood.  In this case decisions were made regarding notching launch vehicle environments at low frequencies, serendipitously in the same range a launch vehicle mode existed. Furthermore, the telemetry received from the la unch vehicle indicated that the rocket exceeded its maximu m predicted environment in the same range.   In this case, when the space vehicle was not able to be contacted on orbit a potential cause for failure was determined to be incorrect notching strategies during vibration testing.   Although root cause cannot be positively confirmed, data that shows what environments the system elements should be tested will allow all agencies to understand the risk that is be ing accepted early and develop mitigation strategies if they are required later in the program Final System Design At this point in the development a focused effort needs to be made early in the phase to finalize interfaces and resolve any lingering trades.  As pre liminary designs are accepted, a review of each subsystem needs to be completed before the remaining procurement decisions are finalized and production planning can begin. Figure 6 depicts the detailed systems design process Reviews should be thorough, include appropriate stakeholders and mission assurance bodies to ensure decisions are made in an informed fashion prior to proceeding into a review.  In terms of systems architecting very little new information is recommended at this phase Instead, the architecture models should act as management

  14 tools to ensure the design is has properly matured, open issues are resolved and form al interface agreements have been driven to closure Table 6 shows the system architecture framework and maturity that is suggested for this phase In order to do this in an effective manner designs and models need to be finalized and circulated with stakeholders ahead of the review.  Al so, for critical interfaces simulations or test with engineering models should be considered to validate a design.  This is especially important when considering interfaces among systems that are near the program critical path. The program CDRL lists and open system trade data models will help assess if this has been completed in a timely manner In many cases for S&T missions, the desire to transition from design to integration rapidly is paramount at this point in the mission.  If this is desired, the element of production planning needs to also be considered at this juncture in the design.  In this case, a detailed model that shows how all developmental items will procured, prepared and tested to support planned integration is critical is assessing the validity of the approach for ensuing phases.  This plan model should show how all elements both flight and nonflight support the baseline schedule or how they are deficient in order to highlight risk areas to mitigate Integrated Production Tracking Tool \(FFP-6 227  There have been many instan ces in the development of systems where a small and relatively inexpensive system element causes a significant schedule delay due to unavailability or oversight in th e product planning effort.  In most instances these issues could have been avoided if comprehensive tools are used to identify all required parts including ground support equipment\and track their availability versus need date for system integration.  This information will be essential in being able to assess the readiness of a group to transiti on from design to integration 5  C ONCLUSIONS  Architecture needs to be pur pose driven.  The value of system architecture is not plainly apparent to many and the existence of regulatory guidance will not force architecting to be well aligned with engineering.   Unless architecting activities for a given system are given a clear purpose, it may be difficult for people to identify how they serve a purpose and immediately are useful and applicable DoDAF V2.0 has come a long way in helping to change the perception of architecture by being data-centric and attempting to re-align system architectures to support the decision making processes within a development.  Given the novelty of version 2.0 que stions of supportability and fusion are still largely left unanswered Tailoring systems architectures to meet the need of a specific development is equally important. Architecting emerged as a concept that was essential for large interoperable systems that required long term sustainment and scalability.   In the sp ace S&T arena where the long term supportability and interoperability aren\222t major concerns,  an architecture needs to be tailored to address the issues that are relevant to th e systems such as  managing the complexity and parallel nature of the development providing tools and views to help a developer see that the system or group of systems mature appropriately.   The flexibility built into DoDAF2.0 with composite and \223Fit For Purpose\224 views were used ex tensively in this effort A systems architecture adopted for this S&T environment needs to be kept simple.  Given the finite nature of the missions in a schedule constrained situation, documentation and excess deliverables are always one of the first cost elements to be cut.   Howeve r, if the architecture artifacts are well aligned with existing program documentation, then benefits emerge.  There is little to no benefit in developing architecture simply to document the design which is contained in other documentation, which may be in a variety of formats and often more detailed.  Keeping it simple will allow the architecture to mature more easily with other design efforts Finally, accessibility of the information is extremely important regardless of the tools or methods employed Providing commonly accessible ar eas where a stakeholder knows how to access the information will bolster the alignment of engineering and architecting.  Both the DOD and industry have tools that are available to assist this, and careful review of several options should be completed ensure that  they meet give n needs prior to selection Significance of Research One of the most important aspects of a space science and technology demonstration is timeliness.  If systems cannot be developed and demonstrated in a timely fashion their applicability is diminished significantly.  While schedule performance is very important there is a tenuous balance between the approach im plemented to accelerate a development and the level of technical rigor required.  If a methods like system architecting can facilitate timeliness by helping to reinforce decision making processes and coordinate appropriate technical review this could add significant utility to the developer and deserves consideration as a method for bolstering systems engineering processes Future Research and Application This effort was primarily focused on understanding DoDAF Version 2.0 applicability and challenges to space system development. , and how strategic changes in 2.0 address some of those issues and offering a example of how it could 


  15 be implemented for a given application \(developmental space systems eful to augment this effort some in different areas Extending the application of this architecture beyond the space domain to other system ty pes would provide valuable insight.  One could begin to see practical \223shared\224 elements beyond DoDAF suggested views. This architecture could also be expanded further in the space development process to include integration  and test and operations and maintenance. Additionally, the adoption and trial of an architecting effort for a deve lopmental space system would provide important feedback on the applicability of the suggested implementation System architecting\222s real value lies in its ability to optimize the manner that information is exchanged among system elements in order facilitate development of the complete system.  The method that is used to achieve this is going to be drastically different based on the actual system, its goals its stakeholders, schedule, funding and many other factors In order to make system architecture relevant and useful it needs be tailored.   Additionally, tailoring needs to extend beyond simply what is included in the model to how and when the information is gathered and must be well aligned with organizational or industry wide practices for development REFERENCES   Depart m e nt of Defe nse.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship.
