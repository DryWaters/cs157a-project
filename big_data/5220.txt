Consideration on a Formal Frame for Data Mining Jan Rauch Faculty of Informatics and Statistics The University of Economics Prague Prague Czech Republic rauch@vse.cz Abstract A formal framework for data mining with association rules is introduced Its goal is to help to understand better to a data mining process and to be a platform to automate this process Association rules are understood as general relations of two boolean attributes Keywords formal framework for data mining logic of discovery association rules logic of association rules GUHA method I I NTRODUCTION The goal of this paper is to present considerations on a formal framework covering important steps in a data mining process with association rules The focus is on including formalized items of domain knowledge  expressions understandable to domain experts without experience with data mining An example is the expression BMI  Diastolic which says that if patientês BMI Body Mass Index increases then his/here diastolic blood pressure increases too We call this framework FOFRADAR FOrmal FRAmework for Data mining with Association Rules It is inspired by a logic of discovery see section II-A Consideration on FOFRADAR was started by results on observational calculi introduced in section II-B and by experience with the LISp-Miner system outlined in section III Main features of FOFRADAR are introduced in section IV Detailed description of all features is out of the scope of this paper Thus several examples of the most important parts of FOFRADAR based on section III are given in section V FOFRADAR deals with domain knowledge formally expressed by formulas different from association rules The correspondence between domain knowledge and association rules is ensured by mapping particular items of domain knowledge to sets of association rules which can be considered as consequences of these items This mapping is done in co-operation with a domain expert Deduction rules concerning association rules play an important role in this approach No similar approach is known at the best authorês knowledge II L OGIC OF D ISCOVERY AND ASSOCIATION RULES A Logic of Discovery Logic of discovery was introduced in the book which starts with two questions Q 1  Can computers formulate and justify scientiìc hypotheses Q 2  Can they comprehend empirical data and process it rationally using the apparatus of modern mathematical logic and statistics to try to produce a rational image of the observed empirical world Logic of discovery developed to answer these questions is based on a scheme of inductive inference theoretical assumptions observational statement  theoretical statement  This means that if we accept theoretical assumptions and verify a particular statement about the observed data we accept the conclusio n a theoretical statement Observational and theoretical calculi are developed as languages in which observational and theoretical statements are formulated Formulas of observational calculi correspond to suitable statements on observed data Formulas of theoretical calculi refer to systems of possible worlds and probability is understood as a measure on such a system of possible worlds Observational and theoretical calculi are interrelated by inference rules used in statistical hypothesis testing Observational predicate calculi are introduced in They result from classical predicate calculi by allowing only nal data structures in which formulas are interpreted and by adding generalized quantiìers The most in studied observational predicate calculi are calculi formulas of which correspond to association rules Several classes of association rules are deìned and studied e.g classes of implicational or symmetrical rules Important results about formulas of observational predicate calculi which we can consider as association rules are achieved in These calculi were further modiìed see section II-B There usually is a 1:1 correspondence between formulas of an observational calculus and statistically motivated assertions on the whole inìnite set of objects we are interested in Thus there is also a one-one correspondence between tasks of nding interesting theoretical statements and tasks of nding interesting observational statements The task of nding interesting observational statements is solved by the GUHA procedures Input of the GUHA procedure consists of analyzed data and of several parameters deìning a large set of relevant observational statements The output is a representation of a set of all relevant observational statements true in input data The most-used GUHA procedure is the ASSOC procedure mining for patterns which can be seen as a generalization of association rules introduced later in  The procedure 4ft-Miner 5 is probably the most-used 562 2011 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computin g 978-1-4577-0371-3/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 


implementation of the ASSOC procedure It is involved in the system LISp-Miner see section III B Logical Calculi of Association Rules The boom of association rules in the 1990s was the start of a new effort in the study of association rules as formulas of observational calculi A syntax of a predicate observational calculus has been signiìcantly simpliìed only calculi with monadic predicates are further studied Free and bound variables are omitted Data matrices with a nite set of possible values for each column are used instead of  0  1  data matrices and basic boolean attributes are used instead of predicates see also calculi with qualitative values introduced in Resulting calculi are called logical calculi of association rules  We informally outline a deìnition of a logical calculus LC AR of association rules for details see A type of LC AR is a K-tuple 012 t 1 t K  of natural numbers t i  2  i 1 K  Symbols of a language L AR of LC AR are attributes A 1 A K and 4ft-quantiìers  1   Q  Possible values of attributes are called categories  attribute A i has categories 1 t i  i 1 K  Type of attribute A i is t i  Formulas of L AR are interpreted in models of LC AR i.e data matrices of type 012 t 1 t K   Data matrix M of type 012 t 1 t K  is understood as a structure M  012 M f 1 f k  where M   o 1 o n  is a nite set of n objects corresponding to rows of M and f 1 f k are functions corresponding to columns of M  The function f i maps the set M to the set  1 t i  for i 1 K  We assume that there is a possibly inìnite set D called domain of LC AR such that M D for each model M  012 M f 1 f k  of LC AR  Domain D of LC AR corresponds to a set of all objects we are interested in data matrix M  012 M f 1 f k  is a result of an observation of a nite subset of D  If A i is an attribute of type t i then each expression A i    where   1 t i  is a basic boolean attribute  The set  is a coefìcient of A i     The basic boolean attribute A i    is true in a row o j  M if and only if it is f i  o j    where i 1 K and j 1 n  More formally  in the expression f i  o j    means a subset of natural numbers and  in the expression A i    means a list of representations of particular numbers from the set   Association rule is an expression    where  is a 4ftquantiìer and  and  are boolean attributes derived from basic boolean attributes using propositional connectives    and  in the usual way  is called antecedent and  is called succedent of     Association rule    is true in data matrix M we write Val     M   if the condition given by 4ftquantiìer  is satisìed in a four-fold contingency table 4 ft    M  of  and  in M  otherwise    is false in M we write Val     M   4 ft    M  of  and  in data matrix M is a quadruple 012 a b c d  where a is the number of rows of M satisfying both  and   b is the number of rows satisfying  and not satisfying   etc see Table I Table I 4 ft    M  OF  AND  IN M M      a b   c d There are various 4ft-quantiìers deìned by applications of suitable thresholds to association interestingness measures  and additional 4ft-quantiìers corresponding to statistical hypothesis tests An e xample is 4ft-quantiìer  p,B of founded implication  It is deìned for 0 p  1 and integer B 0 by the condition a a  b  p  a  B  Please note that usual interestingness measures of association rule i.e a conìdence conf and support supp correspond to a condition a a  b  conf  a a  b  c  d  supp  New classes of association rules were deìned and new theoretical results were achieved W e use results concerning deduction rules         where        and   are boolean attributes If this deduction rule is correct and if the rule    is true in data matrix M  then the association rule      is also true in M  There are relatively simple criteria of correctness of such deduction rules III LIS P M INER S YSTEM E XAMPLES OF A PPLICATION The goal of this section is to outline applications of the LISp-Miner system 9 W e introduce here main features of an application of the 4ft-Miner which is in more details presented in W e solv e a n analytical question concerning a data set STULONG and related domain knowledge see section III-A We use association rules introduced in section II-B and the procedure 4ft-Miner to mine for association rules relevant to our question see section III-B A crucial role play atomic consequences of a given item of domain knowledge see section III-C They are used to ltering out rules which can be seen as consequences of a given item of domain knowledge see section III-D and also to interpret remaining rules see section III-E An additional analytical task is formulated and solved in A STULONG Data Set and Analytical Question Data set STULONG concerns a Longitudinal Study of Atherosclerosis Risk Factors 1  It consists of four data 1 The study STULONG was realized at the 2nd Department of Medicine 1st Faculty of Medicine of Charles University and University Hospital in Prague under the

matrices we deal with data matrix Entry only This data matrix concerns 1417 middle-aged men selected from the Prague 2 election lists in year 1975 that have been examined at the beginning of the study Each row of the data matrix describes one man Data matrix has 64 columns corresponding to particular attributes of men We use three groups of attributes deìned for this paper Personal  Problems  and Examinations  Categories of particular attributes are given below together with their frequencies There are missing values and thus a sum of frequencies of all categories of a particular attribute can be less than 1417 Group Personal has four attributes Marital  Status  married 1207 divorced 104 single 95 widower 10 Education  basic school 151 apprentice school 405 secondary school 444 university 397 Responsibility in a job  managerial worker 286 partly independent worker 435 others 636 pensioner 25 BMI  i.e Body Mass Index  16 21  39 21 22  50 22 23  106  31 32  28  32 64 13 categories Group Problems has four attributes with categories yes and no  Diabetes  yes 30 no 1378 Hypertension  yes 220 no 1192 Infarction  yes 34 no 1378 Hyperlipidemia  yes 54 no 815 Group Examinations has three attributes Diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg  012 50 70 74 012 70 80 281  012 110 120 43 012 120 150 16 7 categories Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg  012 90 110 69 012 110 120 207  012 170 180 43 012 180 220 33 9 categories Cholesterol in mg  012 100 160 45 012 160 180 97  012 300 320 57 012 320 540 57 10 categories There are various types of domain knowledge related to the STULONG data Three of them are managed in a formalized form by the LISp-Miner system groups of attributes  information on the particular attributes and mutual inîuence of attributes  There are several types of mutual inîuence among attributes An example is an expression BMI  Diastolic saying that if BMI of a man increases then manês diastolic blood pressure increases too We use this item of domain knowledge and the above introduced groups of attributes to formulate an analytical question In the data matrix Entry  are there any interesting relations between combinations of personal characteristics and problems of men on one side and results of his examinations on the other side However we are not interested in consequences of the known fact that if BMI increases then diastolic blood pressure increases too B Applying 4ft-Miner We deal with association rules thus we convert our question to a question concerning association rules A converted question can be written as  Entry     BMI  Diastolic   B  Personal  B  Problems    B  Examinations   Here B Personal  denotes a set of all boolean attrib utes derived from attributes of the group Personal we consider relevant to the analytical question etc This means that we search rules  Pe   Pr   E which are true in data matrix Entry  cannot be understood as consequences of BMI  Diastolic   Pe B  Personal    Pr B  Problems   and  E B  Examinations   In addition  is a suitable 4ftquantiìer Conjunction  Pe   Pr is an antecedent and  E is a succedent of rules we are interested in A possibility to deìne a set of relevant antecedents and a set of relevant succedents to solve our analytical question by the 4ft-Miner procedure is outlined in Figure 1 Figure 1 Deìnitions of relevant antecedents and succedents The row Personal Conj 1-4 and four consecutive rows deìne set B Personal  Each  Pe is a conjunction of 1 4 basic boolean attributes derived from particular attributes of the group Personal  The row Marital_Status\(subset 1-1 B pos deìnes a set of basic boolean attributes derived from attribute Marital Status  It says that all basic boolean attributes Marital Status    where  is a subset of all categories of attribute Marital Status containing 1 1 categories are generated Marital Status  married  Marital Status  divorced  Marital Status  single  and Marital Status  widower  Set of basic boolean attributes derived from attribute Responsibility is deìned similarly The row Education\(int 1-2 B pos deìnes basic boolean attributes derived from attribute Education  All 7 basic boolean attributes Education    where  is a set of 1 2 consecutive categories i.e interval of categories are generated Attributes Education  basic school  and Education  basic school  apprentice school  are examples The row BMI\(int 1-4 B pos deìnes basic boolean attributes for attribute BMI  All boolean attributes BMI    where  is a set of 1-4 consecutive categories are generated Examples of such boolean attributes are BMI 16 21  and BMI 21 22   22 23   i.e BMI 21 23   564 


46 basic boolean attributes are deìned this way and more than 6 500 conjunctions  Pe are deìned altogether The row Problems Disj 1-4 and four consecutive rows deìne set B Problems  Each  Pr B  Problems  is a disjunction of 1 4 boolean attributes Diabetes  yes  Hyperlipidemia  yes  Hypertension  yes  and Infarction  yes  About 10 5 antecedents  Pe   Pr where  Pe B  Personal  and  Pr B  Problems  are deìned in the upper part of Figure 1 Set B  Examinations  of relevant succedents is deìned similarly in a bottom part of Figure 1 only basic boolean attributes with coefìcients  intervals are used About 2  4  10 9 association rules are deìned by settings in Figure 1 We use 4ft-quantiìer  0  85  30 of founded implication deìned by the condition a  a  b  0  85  a  30  The task was solved in 112 minutes PC with 2GB RAM and Intel T7200 processor at 2 GHz and 123 true rules were found For more details see and also 5 C Atomic Consequences We are interested only in such association rules from 123 output association rules which are not consequences of the item BMI  Diastolic of domain knowledge A set AC  BMI  Diastolic   0  85  30  of very simple association rules BMI     p,B Diastolic    which can be considered as consequences of BMI  Diastolic is used Such simple association rules are called atomic consequences of BMI  Diastolic for 4ft-quantiìer  0  85  30  We deìne the set AC  BMI  Diastolic   0  85  30 sa set of all rules BMI  low   p,B Diastolic  low   BMI  medium   p,B Diastolic  medium   and BMI  high   p,B Diastolic  high   where p  0  85 and B  30  The only problem is to deìne suitable coefìcients low  medium  and high for basic attributes derived from attributes BMI and Diastolic  There are 13 categories of BMI 16 21   21 22     31 32    32 and 7 categories of Diastolic 012 50 70  012 70 80    012 110 120   120  We can accept that basic boolean attribute BMI    will be considered as BMI  low  if  A low   16 21   21 22   24 25   Similarly basic boolean attribute Diastolic    will be considered as Diastolic  low f  S low  012 50 70  012 70 80  012 80 90   We say that rules BMI  low   p,B Diastolic  low  are deìned by a rectangle R low  A low S low  The LISp-Miner system supports deìnitions of such sets of atomic consequences In Figure 2 there is a graphical deìnition of the rectangle R low together with deìnitions of rectangles R medium and R high deìning coefìcients medium and high for attributes BMI and Diastolic  In gure 2 there are both blind deìnition and deìnition with frequencies in data matrix Entry  We can see that there are three men satisfying both BMI 16 21  and Diastolic 012 50 70  etc Figure 2 Deìnition of rectangles R low  R medium  R high D Filtering out Consequences of BMI  Diastolic We lter out all output rules   p,B  satisfying one of the conditions i  iv AC means an atomic consequence of BMI  Diastolic  i   p,B  is an AC ii   p,B  logically follows from an AC iii   p,B  does not logically follow from any AC however it says nothing new interesting in addition to a particular AC iv   p,B  says nothing new interesting in addition to a rule logically following from a particular AC More details follow Please note there is a theorem making possible to decide if a rule    p,B   logically follows from an additional rule   p,B  3 i There is no AC among 123 output rules ii There is no rule among 123 output rules that logically follows from a particular AC iii There is an output rule denoted R 1  BMI 24 26  HI  0  875  42 Diastolic 012 70 100  HI denotes Hyperlipidemia  yes   Infarction  yes  The atomic consequence BMI 24 26  0  875  42 Diastolic 012 70 100 denoted AC 1  is created from the rectangle A medium S medium  It can be easy proved that R 1 does not logically follow from AC 1 3 Rule R 1 says nothing new interesting in addition to AC 1  R 1 concerns men satisfying BMI 24 26  HI antecedent of R 1  i.e a subset of men satisfying BMI 24 26  antecedent of AC 1  Thus we lter the rule R 1 out More rules can be ltered out due to analogous reasons iv There is an output rule we denote it R 2  BMI 24 28  MUH  0  865  32 Diastolic 012 80 110 where MUH means Marital Status  married   Education  university   Hypertension  yes  There is an atomic consequence we denote it AC 2  BMI 24 28  0  865  32 Diastolic 012 80 100 created from the rectangle A medium S medium  see section III-C Rule BMI 24 28  0  865  32 Diastolic 012 80 110 we denote it R 3  logically follows from AC 2  However rule R 2 says nothing new interesting in addition to R 3  and thus we lter rule R 2 out Let us note that the rule R 3 logically follows from AC 2 because of each man satisfying Diastolic 012 80 100 satisìes 565 


also Diastolic 012 80 110  for details see or 3 The 4ftMiner procedure has tools for ltering out rules according to points i iv They were used to lter out 97 rules consequences of BMI  Diastolic for data matrix Entry and 4ft-quantiìer  0  85  30  E Interpreting Remaining Rules There are 26 remaining association rules 16 of them have a form   p,B Systolic     Thus it is natural to ask if they can be considered as consequences of a possibly new item BMI  Systolic of knowledge saying that if BMI increases then Systolic increases too We assume here that BMI  Diastolic is the only known item of domain knowledge This assumption of course is not true We use the approach described in section III-D We deìne a set AC  BMI  Systolic   0  85  30  of atomic consequences of BMI  Systolic for 4ft-quantiìer  0  85  30 as a set of all rules BMI  low   p,B Systolic  low   BMI  medium   p,B Systolic  medium   and BMI  high   p,B Systolic  high   where p  0  85 and Base  30  We use the same deìnitions of coefìcients low  medium  and high for attribute BMI and similar deìnitions of these coefìcients for attribute Systolic as for Diastolic  Attribute Systolic has 9 categories 012 90 110  012 110 120   012 170 180  012 180 220  see section III-A We deìne Systolic  low  by condition low 012 90 110  012 130 140   Systolic  medium y medium 012 120 130  012 150 160  and Systolic  high y high 012 140 150  012 180 220   Then we use the corresponding rectangles as in section III-C This way we identify all 16 rules with a form of BMI     p,Base Systolic    as consequences of the item BMI  Systolic  This conclusion can lead to start of an additional research of the possibly new item BMI  Systolic of domain knowledge For more details on interpretation of remaining rules see IV FOFRADAR F RAMEWORK O VERVIEW FOFRADAR is intended to be a formal framework supporting important steps in data mining with association rules built from basic boolean attributes A    where  is a subset of categories of the attribute A  These subsets are automatically generated from particular categories Subsets consisting of several consecutive categories of ordinal attributes i.e intervals of categories make possible to deal with variants of basic boolean attributes like A  low   A  medium   A  high   This opens important possibilities 1 We can deìne basic categories as the smallest reasonable categories for each attribute and then to use suitable basic boolean attributes to build all reasonable granules we are interested in see section IV-A 2 Items of domain knowledge like BMI  Diastolic can be mapped to sets of atomic association rules Resulting sets of atomic rules can be used to lter out uninteresting rules or to identify traces of new items of domain knowledge in the output see section V-D 3 We can deal with various exceptions e.g the rule BMI  low   Diastolic  high  can be understood as an exception from BMI  Diastolic when suitable 4ft-quantiìer  is used FOFRADAR is developed to be a formal frame covering important steps when applying these possibilities A core of FOFRADAR is a logical calculus LC AR of association rules which is enhanced by suitable additional languages and procedures Particular steps in a data mining process are understood as applications of procedures transforming formulas of one language into formulas of another language The step of data mining i.e modeling according to the CRISP-DM methodology is realized by the ASSOC procedure FOFRADAR languages and procedures are introduced in sections IV-B and IV-C respectively A Basic Granularity Association rules of calculus LC AR are evaluated in data matrices resulting from observation of attributes A 1 A K for a nite number of objects chosen from a given domain D  Language of LC AR depends on categories i.e possible values of attributes in question We use data matrix Entry introduced in section III-A as an example It is a result of an observation of 1417 middleaged men selected from the Prague 2 election lists in year 1975 Thus our domain is a set of all middle-aged men listed in election lists We denote this domain as ST  Values of 64 attributes were observed for chosen men Some of the attributes are nominal e.g Marital status  some of them are ordinal e.g Education  and values of additional attributes are real numbers e.g BMI with values 18.67 28.32 etc Set of possible values of a real-valued attribute is usually divided into several intervals which are then considered as categories of the attribute We assume that we can get for each real-valued attribute a nite set of intervals of reasonable minimal length For BMI  such intervals can be 10 11   49 50  it has no sense to consider for BMI intervals 10  00 10  01   49  99 50  00  etc Data matrix Entry can be thus considered as a structure 012 M E f 1 f 64  where M E ST  M   o 1 o 1417  and f 1 f 64 are functions with values natural numbers denoting categories of observed attributes A 1 A 64  Intervals with reasonable minimal length are called categories with a basic granularity  attributes with such categories are called attributes with a basic granularity  Nominal and ordinal attributes are also attributes with a basic granularity  and their categories are categories with a basic granularity  Anyway each real-valued attribute has after transformation only nite number of categories and it is treated as an ordinal attribute 566 


If a LC AR concerns only attributes with categories with a basic granularity then we say that the LC AR is of a basic granularity  However it can happen that frequencies of particular categories in a given data matrix M are too low and it is suitable to redeìne categories If each new category of each ordinal attribute is a union of consecutive categories with a basic granularity and if each new category of each nominal attribute is a union of categories with a basic granularity then we say that the resulting logical calculus of association rules is natural  Please note that following considerations are valid for all LC AR  not only for natural LC AR  B FOFRADAR Languages The aim of FOFRADAR languages is to make possible to talk about inputs and outputs of particular steps of a data mining process All these languages are related to a given logical calculus LC AR of association rules We deìne the following FOFRADAR languages  Language L DK of domain knowledge  An example of its formula is the expression BMI  Diastolic concerning mutual dependence of attributes BMI and Diastolic   Language L AC of atomic consequences of items of domain knowledge  Formulas of L AC deìne for a particular formula of language L DK expressing mutual dependence of attributes suitable sets of simple association rules which can be considered as atomic consequences of the given formula of L DK  An example of a formula of L AC is AC  BMI  Diastolic   0  85  30   see section III-C  Language L Dt for description of important features of the domain D  An example of such a feature is information that only male patients are observed in the STULONG domain ST  However our focus here is not on this language  Language L AQ of analytical questions  In section III-B there is an example of a formula of language L AQ   Entry     BMI  Diastolic   B  Personal  B  Problems    B  Examinations    Language L RAR of sets of relevant association rules  Formulas of this language deìne sets of relevant association rules to be veriìed by the ASSOC procedure in a given data matrix M  Various partial formulas of this langure are in Figure 1 These partial formulas deìne a set of relevant antecedents a set of relevant succedents etc  Language L Concl of conclusions  Formulas of this language express conclusions concerning given run of the ASSOC procedure More details on particular languages are in section V Relations of these languages and additional elements of FOFRADAR to the well known CRISP-DM methodology are outlined in Figure 3 Analyzed data are represented by Figure 3 FOFRADAR and CRISP-DM data matrix M  012 M f 1 f k  of type 012 t 1 t K  We use GUHA procedure ASSOC for modeling its input is given by data matrix M and by an expression of language L RAR which is created from an expression of language L AQ  Expression of language L AQ is created on the basis of expressions of languages L DK and L Dt  Expressions of languages L DK and L Dt are formulated in co-operation with domain experts and these expressions represent results of business and data understanding Results of analysis are formulated in an analytical report formulas of language L Concl are used Formulas of language L AC and results of the ASSOC procedure are used to prepare formulas of L Concl  C Procedures of FOFRADAR Process of creation of formulas of a FOFRADAR language using formulas of another FOFRADAR language can be seen as an application of one of the following procedures These procedures are still realized mostly manually However there are several new modules in the LISp-Miner system which remarkable help to realize some of these procedures There is a vision that all of these procedures will be automated Some details are in section V A crucial role plays the procedure ASSOC Its input is a data matrix M and an expression  of the language L RAR i.e deìnition of a set  of relevant association rules Output of the procedure ASSOC is a set ASSOC  M   of all association rules      which are true in M  However we do not consider ASSOC as a part of FOFRADAR We assume to use the following procedures for transformations of formulas of particular languages of FOFRADAR   procedure DK  AQ which transforms formulas of language L DK to formulas of language L AQ 567 


 procedure Dt  AQ which transforms formulas of language L Dt to formulas of language L AQ  procedure AQ  RAR which transforms formulas of language L AQ to formulas of language L RAR  procedure DK  AC which transforms formulas of language L DK to formulas of language L AC  procedure CONCL transforming set ASSOC  M   to formulas of L Concl  it uses also formulas of L AC  V FOFRADAR SELECTED D ETAILS AND E XAMPLES Selected details related to FF AR of type 012 t 1 t K  are given in this section Examples from section III are used see also 8 A Language L DK of Domain Knowledge There are three types of domain knowledge  NO types of attributes groups of attributes and mutual inîuence of attributes NO types of attributes are given by a K-tuple 012 012 1 012 K  where 012 i  N O  If 012 i  N then attribute A i is nominal if 012 i  O then attribute A i is ordinal  Attributes A 1 A K are divided into R basic groups  A 1    A g 1  A g 1 1    A g 2   A g R  2 1  A g R  1  A g R  1 1   A K by natural numbers g 1 g 2 g R  1 satisfying 1  g 1 g 2 g R  1 K where R  1 K  The basic groups reîect a structure of observed attributes as understood by a domain expert It is possible to deìne additional groups of attributes by suitable lists of attributes There are various expressions of L DK language expressing a mutual inîuence of attributes  Both ii expression i.e increases increases and id expression i.e increases decreases concern two ordinal attributes A i  A j  i   j  A simple form of an ii expression is A i  A j  it means if A i increases then A j increases too  an example is BMI  Diastolic A simple form of an id expression is A i  A j  It means if A i increases then A j decreases  An example is Education  BMI  Each ii expression and id expression can also have a conditional form   A 1  A 2   is an example of ii expression in a conditional form Here  is a boolean attribute of the language L AR of a logical calculus LC AR  Intuitive meaning of  A 1  A 2   is If  is satisìed and if A 1 increases then A 2 increases too  etc An example of an id expression in a conditional form is  BMI  Diastolic   Disease X where Disease X is a boolean attribute saying that a patient suffers by a disease X Additional examples of formulas of L DK are in B Domain Knowledge  Atomic Consequences An important feature of the FOFRADAR is that it makes possible to deal with items of domain knowledge expressed in a formal way good understandable to domain expert without deeper knowledge of association rules Formulas of language L DK expressing a mutual relation of attributes are mapped in a natural way to sets of very simple association rules which can be considered as consequences of a given item of domain knowledge A formula  of language L DK expressing a mutual inîuence of attributes is transformed into a set AC     of atomic consequences of  i.e very simple association rules    which can be considered as consequences of  where  is a given 4ft-quantiìer An example of such a transformation is a transformation of the formula BMI  Diastolic of language L DK into a set AC  BMI  Diastolic   0  85  30  of association rules BMI     p,B Diastolic     This transformation is described in section III-C The resulting set of association rules is determined by rectangles 012R low  R medium  and R high   Thus triple 012R low  R medium  R high  can be seen an example of expression of language L AC of atomic consequences of items of domain knowledge C Domain Knowledge  Analytical Questions An example of an analytical question built from expressions of language L DK is the question  Entry     BMI  Diastolic   B  Personal  B  Problems    B  Examinations  introduced in section III-B It can be written in a more general way as  M     A 1  A 2   B  G A  B  G B    B  G C   An additional example of an analytical question is the question  M  Exc   A 1  A 2  which means  In data matrix M  are there any exceptions from the item of domain knowledge  A 1  A 2    A solution of a similar question is outlined in All questions like that introduced above are solved in three main steps 1 A set of relevant association rules is deìned This deìnition can be understood as an expression of language L RAR  2 Each of relevant association rules is veriìed in a given data matrix by the GUHA procedure ASSOC 3 A resulting set of true association rules is interpreted A core of interpretation is in identiìcation of sets of true rules which can be considered as consequences of items of domain knowledge formulas of L DK  The conclusions are expressed by formulas of language L Concl  see section V-D D Formulating Conclusions Conclusions of an analysis are statements about output of an application of the procedure ASSOC Input of ASSOC consists of a data matrix M and an expression  of the language L RAR i.e deìnition of a set  of relevant association rules Output of ASSOC is a set ASSOC  M   of all association rules      which are true in M  We are interested in statements relating expressions of language L DK concerning a mutual inîuence of particular attributes to the set ASSOC  M    568 


If  is an expression of language L DK expressing mutual dependence of attributes and  is a 4ft-quantiìer then Cons  M      denotes a set of association rules    which can be considered as consequences of  in M  Two most important conclusions i.e formulas of language L Concl  are expressions T ooF ew  M     and LotOf  M      The intuitive meaning of T ooF ew  M     is that in an intersection ASSOC  M    Cons  M      there are no or only few of association rules here  is the 4ft-quantiìer used in   Such a conclusion can lead to a modiìcation of  or to a search for new data The intuitive meaning of LotOf  M     is that in an intersection ASSOC  M    Cons  M      there are many of association rules here  is the 4ft-quantiìer used in   Such conclusion can lead to additional analysis to conìrm new yet not known item of knowledge   Please note that actions depending on these conclusions are not formalized by the FOFRADAR The set Cons  M      is deìned as a union AC      LgCn      AgCn  M      where AC     is a set of atomic consequences of  introduced in section V-B LgCn     is a set of logical consequences of  and AgCn  M      is a set of agreed consequences of  in M  LgCn     is a set of all rules       AC     for which there is a A i      A j     AC     such that A i      A j         is a correct deduction rule i.e there is A i      A j     AC     and     logically follows from A i      A j     An example follows The set AC  BMI  Diastolic   0  85  30  is deìned in section III-C and BMI 24 28  0  865  32 Diastolic 012 80 100 belongs to AC  BMI  Diastolic   0  85  30  The rule BMI 24 28  0  865  32 Diastolic 012 80 110 does not belong to AC  BMI  Diastolic   0  85  30  and the deduction rule BMI 24;28  0  865  32 Diastolic  80;100 BMI 24;28  0  865  32 Diastolic  80;110 is correct thus the rule BMI 24 28  0  865  32 Diastolic 012 80 110 belongs to LgCn  BMI  Diastolic   0  85  30  AgCn  M      is deìned such that the a rule       belongs to AgCn  M      if Val         M            AC   LgCn     and there is a rule    012   AC   LgCn     such that       does not logically follow from    012 and it is possible to agree that       does not say anything new in addition to    012  Examples are rules satisfying conditions iii and iv introduced in section III-D Additional examples are in 8 Please note that the set Cons  M      can also be used to decrease remarkably the number of resulting association rules to be interpreted in details If  1   Q are known items of domain knowledge then it is necessary to interpret only the set of rules ASSOC  M     K i 1 Cons  M   i    instead of the set ASSOC  M    see also 8 VI C ONCLUSIONS We have introduced several mutually related formal languages based on logical calculus of association rules and several procedures transforming formulas of one language to formulas of another language We have shown that the whole system of languages and procedures can serve as a formal frame for data mining with association rules We have also pointed out to software tools supporting this formal frame However there still are a lot of details to be developed The ultimate and still very far goal is to develop a formal frame for automation of the whole data mining process A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described here has been supported by Grant No 201/08/0802 of the Czech Science Foundation and by Grant No ME913 of Ministry of Education Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic R EFERENCES  Aggra v al R et al 1996 F ast Disco v ery of Association Rules In Fayyad U M et al eds Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining AAAI Press pp 307  328  H  ajek P Havr  anek T 1978 Mechanising Hypothesis Formation Mathematical Foundations for a General Theory Springer Berlin Heidelberg  Rauch J 2005 Logic of Association Rules Applied Intelligence 22 pp 9Ö28  Rauch J 2010 Logical Aspects of the Measures of Inter estingness of Association Rules In Koronacki J et al eds Advances in Machine Learning II Springer Verlag Berlin pp 175  203  Rauch J  Sim  unek M 2005 An Alternative Approach to Mining Association Rules In Lin T Y et al eds Data Mining Foundations Methods and Applications SpringerVerlag 2005 pp 219  238  Rauch J  Sim  unek M 2009 Dealing with Background Knowledge in the SEWEBAR Project In Berendt B et al Knowledge Discovery Enhanced with Semantic and Social Information Berlin Springer pp 89  106  Rauch J  Sim  unek M 2011 Applying Domain Knowledge in Association Rules Mining Process First Experience In Kryszkiewicz M et al eds Foundations of Intelligent Systems Berlin Springer pp 113  122  Rauch J  Sim  unek M 2011 Dealing with Domain Knowledge in Association Rules Mining  Several Experiments Accepted for The International Conference on Data and Knowledge Engineering  Milan Italy 2011 9  Sim  unek M 2003 Academic KDD Project LISp-Miner In Abraham A et al eds Advances in Soft Computing Intelligent Systems Design and Applications Springer Berlin Heidelberg New York 569

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
