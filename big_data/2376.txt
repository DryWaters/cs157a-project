Introduction  In recent years, infection area of crop diseases and insect pests spread larger and larger, as well as the serious generation degree, which caused enormous economic losses to the peasants. The irrational use of chemical pesticides has caused a series of environmental and social issues that are difficult to resolve and avoid such as agricultural costs rising, declining quality, and environmental polluti  Therefore, effective prediction and early warning for crop diseases and insect pests is necessary, and it would provide the dependable basis for prevention and treatme nt at the same time.

performance of accuracy in pest forecasting is improved by the algorithm   Previous prediction systems and the application of the algorithm have achieved certain effect. Growth cycle in different insect pests and crop diseases, morbidity in different characteristics, different pests and diseases should establish their own prediction model. However, in the past all kinds of crop diseases and insect pests prediction and early warning systems often use the same algorithm and model, which limits the accuracy of the prediction. Combining association rules with ISODATA vegetable crop diseases and insect pests of flea beetle early warning model is established in this paper, which has been the accession to the model-based early warning WebGIS crops biological disasters monitoring and early warning system  2. Fuzzy association rules  Apriori algorithm is one of most influential and classical algorithm that mine s Boolean association rules and frequent itemset However, t h i s associ at i on rules are single-dimension and single-layer Boolean association rules, the generation of which bases on such a reality: each item in the transaction is independent and simultaneous. Nevertheless, there exists such a case frequently: in one transaction, some items are independent, but some can not occur simultaneously. The case is relevant to multidimensional association rules mining, which is applied to extract classification association rules in the following text. Multidimensional association rules involve multi-attribute or multipredication rules. In mining process, different attributes in the same transaction is independent, and each value or range belonging to the same attribute must emerge, but not simultaneously If the form of multidimensional association rule is conditionset=>y, where conditionset denotes itemset, and y denotes class label, then this association rule is defined as classification association ru le. The attribute in database might be categorical attribute or quantitative attribute. If there are quantitative attributes in data samples, it is necessary to discretize the data samples. In nature, the classification association rules including quantitative attributes is fuzzy classi fication association rules Supposing an attribute set 12     n I II I  and a fuzzy transaction database 12    m DDD D  the discovered rules are of the form AB where 1  i Dim  is a transaction of D   A IB I    AB   and AB  do not contain any two items that are associated with the same attribute. The minimal Support and the minimal Confidence of fuzzy classification association rules could be defi    1   Support \(A B n i Ax By D    1   Confidence \(A B  n i Ax By Ax     Where D is the total number of transactions in D  which is equal m the number of transactions in the quantitative database D   Ax and  B y denote the degree of membership of the element x and y with respect to the fuzzy set A and B respectively  is a tnorm   3.

Semi-supervised learning algorithm  The two categories algorithms of pattern classification are mainly supervised learning and unsupervised learning Training samples needed to be labeled in supervised learning algorithm. Supervised learning algorithm structures the optimal model so as to get the minimum error between the known knowledge. It's a process optimization with the single exact goal and high accuracy Supervised learning algorithms couldn't operate without training samples or labels. Unsupervised learning algorithms haven't got precise targets, in the condition of the samples without labeled, it could find out the significative model in accordan ce with the characteristics of their own targets, but accur acy is relatively low. Semisupervised learning method combines the virtue of supervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithms It can be flexible learni ng, and enhance accuracy under certain condition. Flea beetle prediction and early warning model is constructed by semi-supervised learning method based on the supervised learning information from association rules combining with unsupervised learning method ISODATA Specifically, flea beetle samples are provided with a number of different data attributes, homologous

The shorter the distance between points eigenvector performs for, the corresponding model will be more similar, and the feasibility of corresponding model belong to the same class will be much more likely In a densely distributed region, the models are similar and then the same class could be formed by the polymerization. Set the points with labels mined by association rules as cluste ring centers, agglomerate or divide the association ru les by ISODATA, and then calculate the distance between unlabeled samples with agglomerative or divisive centers. Unlabeled samples with minimum distance to agglomerative or divisive centers will be labeled the same class. Assume the flea beetle pest databases of all the samples are independent and each is a subset of samples the calculation steps are as follows Step 1: Select a period of time of flea beetle as a training samples as the training samples, excavated association rules as the initial clustering centers Step 2: Agglomerate or divide the association rules by ISODATA, the new clustering centers are got Step 3: Compare with the clustering centers, find out the minimum distance.

association mining The Likelihood Ratio Test fails to extract features also belonging to common vocabulary and it makes the extraction dependent on the feature position in the sentence leading to low recall The dBNP and bBNP based methods yield low recall due to the fact that the product features do not occur with the article the in front of them very often The Association Mining approach returns all frequent nouns which decreases precision Our results suggest that the choice of algorithm to use depends on the targeted dataset If it consists of mainly on-topic content the results of Table 10 indicate that the Association Mining algorithm is better suited for this task due to its high recall If the dataset consists of a mixture of onand off-topic content our results suggest that the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm would perform better due to its ability to distinguish and 002lter out the off-topic features For future work we plan to extend the Likelihood Ratio Test methods especially the dBNP based approach by other determiners such as a or this  which should increase the recall of this method Another possibility which we will investigate regards the BNP patterns The current Likelihood Ratio Test approach is not capable of dealing with discontinuous feature phrases for example in 5 the quality of the pictures is great the feature would be picture quality  This problem could be addressed by introducing wildcards in the BNP patterns We will also investigate whether there are any methods in order to calculate an optimal threshold for the candidate feature extraction in order to increase the recall of the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm We plan to investigate whether a deeper linguistic analysis e.g with a dependency parser can improve the feature

a frequency constraint and according to the structure of the dataset These proposals are all based on a global analytical model i.e an interesting approach that needs however to develop complex and speci\036c models As a result they cannot be easily extended to handle complex conjunctions of constraints to incorporate different symbol distributions or different semantics for pattern occurrences To the best of our knowledge no method has been proposed to estimate the number of patterns satisfying a constraint while avoiding to develop a global analytical model Our approach requires only to know how to compute for a given pattern its probability to satisfy the constraint this can be obtained in many situations and it remains ef\036cient in practice by adopting a pattern space sampling scheme 6 Conclusion Using constraints to specify subjective interestingness issues and to support actionable pattern discovery has become popular Constraint-based mining techniques are now well studied for many pattern domains but one of the bottlenecks for using them within Knowledge Discovery processes is the extraction parameter tuning This is especially true in the context of differential mining where domain knowledge is used to provide different datasets to support the search of truly interesting patterns From a user perspective a simple approach would be to get graphics that depict the extraction landscape i.e the number of extracted patterns for many points in the parameter space We developed an ef\036cient technique based on pattern space sampling that provides an estimate on the number of extracted patterns This has been applied to non trivial substring pattern mining tasks and we demonstrated by means of many experiments that the technique is effective It provides reasonable estimates given execution times that enable to probe a large number of points in the parameter space Notice that domain knowledge is also exploited here when selecting the distribution model Future directions of work include to adapt the approach to other pattern domains and to different constraints Another interesting aspect to investigate is the use of more sophisticated sampling schemes e.g that could b e incorporated in the approach when more complex syntactical constraints are handled e.g a grammar to specify the shape of the patterns Acknowledgments This work is partly funded by EU contract IQ FP6-516169 Inductive Queries for Mining Patterns and Models and by the French contract ANR-MDCO14 Bingo2 Knowledge Discovery For and By Inductive Queries We thank Dr Olivier Gandrillon from the Center for Molecular and Cellular Genetics CNRS UMR 5534 who provided the DNA promoter sequences References  J F  Boulicaut L De Raedt and H  M annila e ditors Constraint-Based Mining and Inductive Databases  volume 3848 of LNCS  Springer 2005  C  B resson C K e ime C F a ure Y  Letrillard M  B arbado S San\036lippo N Benhra O Gandrillon and S GoninGiraud Large-scale analysis by SAGE revealed new mechanisms of v-erba oncogene action BMC Genomics  8\(390 2007  L  C ao and C  Z hang Domain-dri v e n actionable kno wledge discovery in the real world In Proceedings PAKDDÕ06 volume 3918 of LNCS  pages 821830 Springer 2006  G  D ong and J  L i Ef 036cient mining of emer ging patterns discovering trends and differences In Proceedings ACM SIGKDDÕ99  pages 4352 1999  F  Geerts B  G oethals and J  V  d en Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans on Database Systems  30\(2 2005  U  K eich and P  A  P e vzner  S ubtle motifs de\036ning the limits of motif 036nding algorithms Bioinformatics  18\(10 2002  S  K ramer  L De Raedt and C  Helma M olecular f eature mining in HIV data In Proceedings KDDÕ01  pages 136 143 2001  L  L hote F  Rioult and A  S oulet A v e rage number of frequent closed patterns in bernouilli and markovian databases In Proceedings IEEE ICDMÕ05  pages 713716 2005  I  M itasiunaite a nd J.-F  B oulicaut Looking for monotonicity properties of a similarity constraint on sequences In Proceedings of ACM SACÕ06 Data Mining  pages 546552 2006  I Mitasiunaite and J F  Boulicaut Introducing s oftness i nto inductive queries on string databases In Databases and Information Systems IV  pages 117132 IOS Press 2007  I Mitasiunaite C Rigotti S Schicklin L  M e yniel J F  Boulicaut and O Gandrillon Extracting signature motifs from promoter sets of differentially expressed genes Technical report LIRIS CNRS UMR 5205 INSA Lyon France 2008 23 pages Submitted  G Ramesh W  M aniatty  a nd M J Zaki F easible itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proceedings ACM PODSÕ03  pages 284295 2003  F  Zelezn  y Ef\036cient sampling in relational feature spaces In Proceedings ILPÕ05  volume 3625 of LNCS  pages 397 413 Springer 2005
