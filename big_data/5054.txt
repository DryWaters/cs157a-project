Results show that: combined with the adaptive genetic algorithm, the precision and efficiency of mining association rules is improved Keywords- Multi-dimension Association Rule; Adaptive Genetic Algorithm; Crossover Matrix; Mutation Matrix I  I NTRODUCTION  Since its introduction, Association Rule Mining \(R Agrawal, H. Mannila, R. Srikant, H. Toivonen, and A Inkeri Verkamo. 1996\, has become one of the core data mining tasks, and has attracted tremendous interest among data mining researchers and practitioners. It is widely recognized that the set of association rules can rapidly grow to be unwieldy, especially as we lower the frequency requirements. The larger the set of frequent itemsets the more the number of rules presented to the user, many of which are redundant. This is true even for sparse datasets but for dense datasets it is simply not feasible to mine all possible frequent itemsets, let alone to generate rules between itemsets. In such datasets one typically nds an exponential number of frequent itemsets Being the factor mention above, many researchers study association rule mining by using computation intelligence algorithms. Cattral R., Oppacher F. and Deugo D. \(1999 describes the implementation and the functioning of RAGA rule acquisition with a genetic algorithm\a geneticalgorithm-based data mining system suitable for both supervised and certain types of unsupervised knowledge extraction from large and possibly noisy databases. Zhu Yu Zhang Hong, and Kong Lingdong \(2009\ proposed a method of mining multi-dimensional association rules based on artificial immune algorithm, and the algorithm has faster speed of mining multi-dimensional association rules  Wu Zhao-hui, Zhang Gui-juan, and Liu Xi-yu \(2005\ presented A new association rule mining algorithm based on improved simulated  annealing genetic algorithm, This algorithm used adaptive crossover probability and mutation probability, and restrained premature convergence effectively Itês well know that the selection of optimal parameter values for the genetic algorithm is tedious. Thus an adaptive system, where the parameter values are automatically adapted on the basis of the problem instance, would be highly desired. In this paper we propose an adaptive genetic algorithm \(AGA\ with mutation matrix and crossover matrix for the multi-dimension association rule problem The aim is to give an effective and straight-forward algorithm which obtains good solutions for mining multidimension association rule. Selection, mutation, and crossover are all parameter-free in the sense that the problem at a particular stage of evolution will choose the parameters automatically The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We begin in section 2 by giving a formal denition of the association rule mining. The adaptive genetic algorithm is described in section 3. In section 4 we show how to make use of the adaptive genetic algorithm in order to mine association rule The performance of the algorithm is studied experimentally in section 5. Conclusions are drawn in section 6 II M ULTI DIMENSION A SSOCIATION R ULE  Let I={I 1 I 2 I m  be a set of items.

Szeto and Zhang 2005\ propose mutation only genetic algorithm \(MOGA firstly. MOGA is superior to many traditional methods \(Ma and Szeto,2004; Szeto and Zhang, 2005; Zhang and Szeto 2005\. The idea behind MOGA is that mutation probability is a function of time, tness ranking of the chromosome and locus For a population of Np chromosomes, each encoded by L locus, can be arranged into a population matrix A with N p  rows and L columns. In matrix A, The rows are listed in decreasing order of the tness f i  f j if i<j Each element of the matrix A has a probability p 0 p 1\ to undergo mutation. These mutation probabilities of A ij  i 1 N P  j  1, ..., L\ form a mutation matrix M.  MOGA makes use of the information of the tness ranking and loci statistics to determine M ij dynamically The mutation matrix can be viewed as an arrangement of genes based on the informative measures: the tness cumulative probability and the standard deviation for the allele distribution. So in each generation, rows in the mutation matrix were rst selected for mutation based on the tness cumulative probability. The probability i o choose the ith row for mutation is dened as    1   i f c i   012 1 where     f g p g N N i f c   1    2 N  g s the number of chromosomes with tness value g Note that C  f is a non-decreasing function of f where C  f max 1 and \( 1 N P  C  f 1 Therefore, a chromosome with higher tness has a lower probability to participate in mutation. As the chromosomes are kept in a decreasing order of the tness f i  f j if i  j in the matrix A i is a non-decreasing function of the row index i Thus i is higher for less t rows. The ttest chromosome, i.e. the rst row of the population matrix A  i 0. It is, hence, never selected for mutation. The worst chromosome, i.e. the last row of A, will mutate with a probability close to unity for large enough N P   N P 1 N P 1 Next, we employ the tness cumulative probability again to determine the number N mg of loci to undergo mutation for the selected chromosomes, each with L loci. Stating the formula for N mg  N mg  i L 3 It is obvious that N mg is also a function of the row index i. If a selected chromosome has a high tness, it has fewer loci to undergo mutation. If a selected chromosome has a low tness, it has more loci to mutate B AGA with crossover matrix Besides the chromosome tness ranking and the loci statistics, the Hamming distance can also be used to describe relationship of chromosomes in matrix A The distance matrix H is a square N P N P matrix with matrix element H ii dened by a distance measure between the i th chromosome, represented by R i which is the i th row vector of the population matrix A, and the i th chromosome R i   we have a measures for H called long Hamming distance crossover \(LHDC\ \(Lam and Szeto 2007\ in which H ii H iíi D ii where D ii is equal to the number of different alleles in these two rows Next, we have to select two chromosomes for crossover The probabilities to choose the two chromosomes are different, but they are both related to H. One probability is just the tness cumulative probability, and we call it the rst crossover probability P CI  i  P CI  i  C  f  i 4 A chromosome, which we call the rst chromosome, is rst chosen with this rst crossover probability. As the row index in H is also the row index in A, chromosome represented by smaller H row index has higher probability to be selected for crossover. Then, the second chromosome is selected with another probability called the second crossover probability. The second crossover probability depends on the chromosome already chosen. If chromosome i is the rst chromosome, then the second crossover probability P CII  i to choose chromosome i' as the second chromosome is    p N k ik ii CII H H i p 1      5 If the rst and the second chromosome are the same, the second one is chosen again until they are both different Finally, we use single-point crossover to deal the two selected chromosome with the crossing points chosen randomly once in a generation. In each generation, a total of N P chromosomes are selected to participate in the crossover Later, the ttest N P chromosomes are selected to form a new generation from the pool of N P original chromosomes and the N P children chromosomes produced by crossover IV M ULTI DIMENSION A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING B ASED ON AGA In  order to apply the Genetic Algorithm \(AGA\ to the  task of association rule  mining  we  found  it  desirable  to modify  the AGA mentioned above in  a  number  of respects.  Detail as following 


 152 A Encode Being Database include quantitative attributes, so we have to preprocess the data before mining. Firstly, we dene a discretization of the attribute for given numerical attributes then replacing numerous values by a small number of interval labels. For instance, a concept hierarchy for age be used to replace the original numeric values of this attribute by interval labels, such as ç0-29é, ç30-39é, ç40-49é, ç5059é, é60-éand so on. Finally, the chromosomes encoded by an array of integers in our paper. This approach allows for greater precision and complexity than the comparatively restricted method of using binary numbers B initial population The initial population is generated randomly, and its preset size is 200 C Definition of fitness function The fitness function is f\(x\=s\(x\/s_min here s\(x is the support number of chromosome x in population s_min is a minimum support threshold user given D Crossover Firstly, system generate a random number p 1 get ith row in matrix A by comparing p 1 and result of formula \(4\ Then system generates another number p 2 which unequal p 1 we get i'th row by using formula \(5\nd p 2 We were using single-point crossovers with the crossing points chosen randomly in a generation E Mutation System generates a random number p, then we can get ith row in matrix A from formula \(3\. We mutate N mg loci located in the selected rows in the mutation matrix randomly For discretization of quantitative attribute, the loci replaced by a interval labels which generated randomly by system F Termination condition In this paper, Processing stops after a specified number of generations, e.g. 200 G Description of algorithm The detail mining process is consists of a sequence of the following steps step1: data preprocess, especially discretize quantitative attributes step2: initialize parameters, set s_min and c_min from user and set value of population size and termination condition step3: after initial population generated randomly, we get population matrix A step4: calculate fitness for each individual step5: ranking rows of matrix A by fitness, and calculate tness cumulative probability of each individual step6: update matrix M and H setp7: crossover and mutation setp8: update next generation, if system meet the termination condition then end, else go to setp4 setp9: rules extract using c_min   V E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  This paper use common Synthetic standards database generated by IBM QUEST\(Agrawal R, I mielinski T, and Swami A. 1993\ as test dataset. The dataset tested uses 20 attributes, and contains 1000 records. We run separately AGA algorithm and GA algorithm by using the dataset 10 times. Figure 1 shows the comparison of algorithm performance between AGA and GA, it states that the convergence of AGA algorithm better than GA. In figure 2 it shows the number of rule acquisition of two association rule mining methods for the test dataset  Fig.1: Comparison of Algorithm performance between AGA and GA  Fig.2: Comparison of number of rules between AGA and GA VI C ONCLUSIONS  We have described a flexible new data mining system based on  a self-adaptive Genetic Algorithm with crossover matrix and mutation matrix.

Take a industrial boiler as an example, there are 52 attributes in the process history database. In the test we will take 10 attribute which are stand for temperature of main vapor, pressure of main vapor, water level, steam drum pressure, steam drum temperature, etc. The fault is category attribute, A-heating pipe blasting, B-priming, C excessive pressure, D-Iess water in boiler, E-more filled water in boiler.

Interval partition by competitive agglomeration algorithm We will use competitive agglomeration algorithm to divide the quantity attribute in the industrial boiler history database. First discretize the quantitative attributes into several optimize intervals, take the main vapor pressure as an example, collect all the data to form a data set X, apply the competitive agglomeration algorithm to cluster X, then we can get partition matrix U and the center of classes vi the row element of U is the degree of membership of the element in X. according to the maximum degree of membership principle, the element in X will be clustered into c classes, take the minimum element as the left end point and the maximum element as the right end point, in this way, the quantitative attributes are discretized into c optimize partitions. Inlikemanner we can discretize the other 9 quantitative attributes, the number of optimize partition are 5 ,  4 ,  4 ,5 ,5 ,6,4 ,5 ,4 respectively.

Analysis of experiment Result From Table 3 ,  we can conclude: most of the rules mined by fuzzy association rules algorithm can reflect the relevance between the attributes and faults in the industrial boiler system. The result of experiment shows that the algorithm is of high preciseness for mining rules 67 IV.

V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables
