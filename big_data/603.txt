Dutta\nInstitute for Intelligent Systems, and Dept. of Electrical Computer Engineering\nThe University of Memphis\nMemphis, TN 38152, USA\n{bbnerjee jkdutta}@memphis.edu\nAbstract—Surveillance sensors are a major source of un-\nstructured Big Data. Discovering and recognizing spatiotem-\nporal objects \(e.g., events security and safety of facilities and indi-\nviduals. Hierarchical feature learning is at the crux to the\nproblems of discovery and recognition. We present a multi-\nlayered convergent neural architecture for storing repeating\nspatially and temporally coincident patterns in data at multiple\nlevels of abstraction. The bottom-up weights in each layer\nare learned to encode a hierarchy of overcomplete and sparse\nfeature dictionaries from space- and time-varying sensory data\nby recursive layer-by-layer spherical clustering. This density-\nbased clustering algorithm ignores outliers by the use of a\nunique adaptive threshold in each neuron’s transfer function.\nThe model scales to full-sized high-dimensional input data and\nalso to an arbitrary number of layers, thereby possessing the\ncapability to capture features at any level of abstraction It is\nfully-learnable with only two manually tunable parameters.\nThe model was deployed to learn meaningful feature hier-\narchies from audio, images and videos which can then be\nused for recognition and reconstruction Besides being online,\noperations in each layer of the model can be implemented in\nparallelized hardware making it very ef?cient for real world\nBig Data applications.\nKeywords-outlier; spherical clustering; Hebbian rule\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSurveillance sensors \(e.g., audio/video surveillance cam-\neras e.g., airport e.g., as in assisted living residences and nursing homes for\ndementia patients recognizing\nspatiotemporal objects \(e.g., visual objects, actions, events,\nspeech objects such as phonemes such data is of\nparamount importance to the security and safety of the\nfacility or individual. Determining appropriate features is\nthe crux to the problems of discovery and recognition. In\nrecent years, there has been a surge of interest in learning\nfeature hierarchies from data using multilayered or deep\nlearning models largely motivated by the layered organi-\nzation of the neocortex. From an application standpoint, a\ngood feature learning algorithm, if developed, would save\na signi?cant amount of human effort usually invested in\nmanually studying the data and coming up with appropriate\nfeatures for detection, recognition or prediction in each\ndomain or application.\nThe contribution of this article is a brain-inspired multi-\nlayered neural model where each layer selectively clusters its\ninput which is the output of the lower layer. The clustering\nalgorithm is density-based, capable of discovering clusters\nof irregular shapes [1], in conjunction with outlier elimi-\nnation to learn robust features in each layer with the same\ncomputational ef?ciency as traditional clustering algorithms\n\(e.g., k-means a challenging problem which is handled by the\nuse of an adaptive threshold unique for each cluster center\nencoded by a neuron. The algorithm operates in an online\nmanner. It scales to full-sized high-dimensional data and to\nan arbitrary number of layers, hence capable of capturing\nfeatures at any level of abstraction. The model is fully-\nlearnable with only two manually tunable parameters.\nIn the next section we review a few important issues\nin learning feature hierarchies from sensory data followed\nby the model description in Section III. In Section IV,\nwe present results by deploying the model for learning\nhierarchies of rich meaningful features from sensory data\nin multiple modalities – images, videos and audio. Results\nfrom this brain-inspired model that support ?ndings in neu-\nroscience are highlighted. Finally, we end with conclusions.\nII. ISSUES IN HIERARCHICAL FEATURE LEARNING\nA. Objective function\nFormulating an objective function helps to understand a\nmodel’s global behavior. Two approaches to feature learn-\ning using deep models are prevalent. In one approach, an\nobjective or energy function is minimized by iteratively\nupdating connection weights with respect to an error signal\nthat is propagated backwards. In case of supervised learning,\nthis signal is often the gradient of the classi?cation error\nwhich results in learning discriminative features while in\nthe unsupervised case, it is the gradient of the reconstruction\nerror which results in learning generative features. An appro-\npriate regularization term is often used to avoid over?tting\nand induce sparsity. Variants of deep belief networks [2],\n2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops\n978-0-7695-5109-8/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/ICDMW.2013.135\n505\nconvolutional neural networks [3], [4], and sparse/denoising\nautoencoders [5] are trained using this approach.\nIn the other approach, unsupervised learning can be\nconceptualized as capturing the distribution of recurring co-\nincident patterns in the data. Clustering is an example of this\napproach though not the only one. Variants of Neocognitron\n[6], HMAX [7] and Hierarchical Temporal Memory [8] are\ntrained using this approach. While a systematic comparison\nbetween the two approaches is missing in the literature, it\nhas been shown that the deep 


belief network is outperformed\nby very simple mixture models at capturing the statistics of\nnatural images adding layers does not effect its performance\nif the ?rst layer is trained well enough [9]. Our model\nlearns feature hierarchies from recurring coincidences in the\ndata in an unsupervised and online manner, minimizing the\nfollowing objective function on convergence at each level of\nthe hierarchy:\n\(X ,W i 1 and features respec-\ntively, N \(i i denotes the cardinality of a set.\nEach data point and feature is normalized to have unit norm.\nIn that case, ?xj?wi?2 = 2?2×\(xj ·wi 1\nis equivalent to maximizing:\n\(X ,W i xj · wi 2 direction of a data\nvector is more important than its magnitude [10] which\nis captured by the normalized dot product \(a.k.a. cosine\nsimilarity soft-partitions a subset of the nor-\nmalized input space; this subset, given by\n?n\ni=1N \(i outliers. Such a formulation may be construed as\na special case of clustering on the surface of a hypersphere\nof unit radius \(a.k.a. spherical clustering [11], [12], [13 allowed to in?uence the\ncluster centers.\nB. Scaling to full-size high-dimensional data\nAlgorithms have been proposed that learn useful features\nfrom small patches of data \(e.g., 10×10 pixel image patch  example. Scaling them to realistic-sized data\n\(e.g., 1024×1024 pixel image is a non-trivial problem [4]. An ensemble of neurons,\ncalled a node, is the canonical computational unit in our\narchitecture. Each node learns from a small patch of data\nwhile each neuron in a node learns to respond to a unique\nfeature. After seeing a large number of patches, all nodes in\na layer will have learned the same set of features. Hence,\ninstead of learning at each node independently, we share\nthe learning in a node throughout a layer. This has three\nbene?ts. First, learning occurs much faster in all nodes as\neach gets the opportunity to learn from all the patches in\neach data. Second, the object properties \(e.g., translation\ninvariance learned in one node is shared throughout the\nlayer. Third, all nodes behave uniformly thereby making the\nmodel’s behavior tractable. See section III and Fig. 1.\nC. Scaling to arbitrary number of layers\nWhen designing multilayered architectures, a pertinent\nquestion to ask is: how many layers are necessary or suf?-\ncient for hierarchical feature learning? No clear answer could\nbe found in the literature. We present an architecture where\nthe process of feature learning at any layer from its lower\nlayer activations may be continued in an arbitrary number\nof layers thereby learning arbitrarily large and complex\nfeatures. However features will be learned in a layer only if\na subset of neurons in the lower layer are repeatedly active\ntogether. If such a subset does not exist, features in a higher\nlayer will neither be stable nor meaningful. Thus, the number\nof layers necessary and suf?cient for hierarchical feature\nlearning is driven by the data [15]. Indeed, we will show\nin section IV-B1 that three layers of features can be learned\nfrom one set of data but only two layers can be learned from\nanother. Being able to scale a model to arbitrary number of\nlayers is crucial for discovering the largest possible features\nwhich are the most abstract representations of the data.\nIII. NETWORK MODEL\nA. Architecture\nOur network architecture consists of a hierarchy of layers\nof nodes \(see Fig. 1 neurons.\nIn the general case, neurons in a node are sparsely connected\nto the neurons in the neighboring nodes in the same layer,\none layer above and one layer below by lateral, bottom-up\n\(or feedforward connections respectively. The\n?rst \(or lowest spatiotemporal data \(e.g., images, videos, audio a\nlayer report to one neuron in the immediate higher layer. The\nreceptive ?eld \(RF region in which\nthe presence of a stimulus may in?uence its activation. In our\nhierarchical model, the RF for a neuron is determined by the\nnumber of nodes in the immediate lower layer reporting to it\nand the RF of the neurons in each node. The RF size is the\nsame for all neurons in a layer and increases as we ascend up\nthe hierarchy. In this paper, we will concentrate on learning\nfeature hierarchies using the feedforward connections only.\n506\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Architecture used in our model is shown. The circles in each\nlayer denote nodes each of which contains an ensemble of neurons See\nsection III for details.\nB. Operation\nThe goal of feedforward processing in the perceptual\ncortices is hypothesized to be rapid categorization [7]. At\neach sampling instant, our model accepts spatial data as\ninput through the ?rst layer which is passed on to higher\nlayers in the form of activations. The goal of computations in\neach node is to selectively cluster the data into groups. Over\ntime, each neuron in a node gets tuned to a unique feature\nwhich represents a cluster center. Functionally, a node is a\nbag of ?lters all of which are applied to each patch of the\ninput data.\nThe output \(or state, see section III-C 


the\ninput to the next higher layer. The same operation is executed\nin each node in any layer. Thus, the feedforward weights in\nthis hierarchical model are learned by recursive layer-by-\nlayer spherical clustering Fig. 2 depicts the operation of\nthis model.\nNotation.

A receptive ?eld obtained by wiring the\nsimple cells is shown in \(vi secondary visual cortex.\nrespect to the feature encoded in each neuron’s RF. This\nallows a neuron to act as a suspicious coincidence detector\n[17], responding with high activation if the input pattern\nmatches the feature encoded in its RF.\nFor a given input, all neurons in a node receive activations.\nThe maximally activated neuron in a node is the “winner”.\nThe state of a neuron is binary and is given by\nS\n\(l t A\(l t l t l t l t 4 and unique for each neuron. It\nregulates the neighborhood N of a neuron by allowing the\nneuron to learn only from inputs very similar to the feature\nencoded in its RF. Only the winner in a node is assigned\nthe state 1 if its threshold is crossed. This is how our model\nimplements the winner-take-all mechanism which allows\nonly the neuron of highest activity to learn. Choosing the\nwinner based on maximum normalized dot product allows\nmaximization of the objective in equ. 2 in a greedy manner.\nWe say a neuron has ?red if its state reaches 1. Thus, it\nis a McCulloch-Pitts neuron model [18] with a threshold\ntransfer function and the state as its output. However, the\nunique threshold, that adapts to the data, allows it to manifest\nproperties more interesting than a McCulloch-Pitts neuron.\nD. Learning: Updating weights and thresholds\nFeedforward weights to neuron i in layer l with S\(l t gradient descent on the objective function in equ.\n1 in an online setting. The gradient descent learning rule is:\n507\nwi\(t+ 1 t 5 decreases with iterations for ?ner convergence, 0 < ? <\n1.

N \(i layer\nneurons, xj is the input, i.e. activations of input layer\nneurons, A\(0 feedforward weights\nleading to each neuron in the ?rst layer get tuned to a unique\nfeature which represents a cluster center. Learning rule for\neach feedforward weight to a ?rst layer neuron is obtained\nby replacing wi by W \(0,1 0,1 t+ 1 1 0,1 t 0 t 7 i.e. l > 1 l?1 l?1 If the activations are propagated up the\nlayers, they continue to get weaker thereby diminishing\nthe difference in outputs of strongly and weakly activated\nneurons. This leads to learning indistinguishable features at\nhigher layers. Using states instead of activations allows the\noutput of neurons to be binary thereby getting rid of the\ndiminishing activation problem at any layer of the hierarchy.\nLearning rule for each feedforward weight to a higher layer\nneuron is:\nW\n\(l?1,l t+1 1 l?1,l t l?1 t 8 normalized to have unit\nnorm, which allows all neurons in a layer to compete on an\nequal footing. A new neuron is not recruited unless the in-\ncoming pattern is more similar to the initialized feature than\nto any of the learned features. After each update, weights\nto each neuron are normalized to have unit norm Thus,\nfeedforward connection from a presynaptic neuron \(j i strengthened while\nthe rest \(to i helps to remove infrequent\ncoincident patterns from memory which are probably noise.\nThe threshold is updated as follows:\n?\n\(l t+ 1 l t l t 1 l t 9 is the threshold decay parameter, a constant, 0 <\n? < 1. Due to the threshold, only a subset of stimuli can\ntrigger learning while the rest of the stimuli, i.e. the outliers,\nare ignored. ? are initialized to ones so that neurons are max-\nimally selective initially. The threshold decay mechanism\ngradually enlarges a 


neuron’s neighborhood until an input\nin the neighborhood is detected that renders the neuron’s\nstate to be unity. The threshold decay ensures that the size\nof the subset that triggers learning remains ?xed throughout\nthe learning process, thereby maintaining the plasticity of\nthe network. The winner-take-all mechanism along with the\nthreshold favor neurons with sparsely distributed activity.\nClustering is a NP-hard problem [19], [20], [21], hence\na variety of heuristic algorithms are in vogue. One of the\nmost widely used is the k-means clustering algorithm which\nruns in O\(Ndk points, d is the dimension of each data point,\nN  d, and k is the number of clusters. The underlying\nprobability distribution of the algorithm is Gaussian [22],\n[23]. In contrast, the underlying distribution in spherical\nclustering is arbitrary and not necessarily Gaussian [13].\nWhen ? = 1, i.e. all data points including outliers are\nbeing learned from, the computational complexity of our\nalgorithm is the same as k-means. As the value of ?\ndecreases, the algorithm learns from less data and performs\nmore ef?ciently. For example, when ? = 10?4, which is\ntypical in case of natural data, less than 10% of the input is\nlearned from The computational bottleneck of our algorithm\nis the normalization step which requires O\(d input. Zhong [13] has proposed several implementation\ntricks to speed up the normalization computation most of\nwhich are applicable only in specialized circumstances.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nIn this section performance of our clustering algorithm on\nbenchmark datasets will be compared to that of a few well-\nknown algorithms. Then, experimental results from using\nour algorithm recursively to learn feature hierarchies from\nimages, videos and audio will be discussed.\nA. Clustering performance\nAs stated in section II-A, our learning algorithm for each\nlayer may be construed as a special case of clustering.\nWe compared its clustering performance to that of three\nalgorithms with interesting properties. First, the k-means\nis one of the most widely used clustering algorithms and\nits performance will serve as a benchmark. Second is the\nalgorithm proposed by Einha¨user et al. [14] for learning\nfeatures from natural videos. It has two distinct properties:\ndivision by past trace for achieving translation or viewpoint\ninvariance, proposed by Fo¨ldia´k 17], and lateral inhibition\nfor determining the winner. This algorithm has been im-\npressive in capturing simple and complex-cell like RFs from\nnatural videos.

It belongs to the class of algorithms known as\ngrowing neural gas [25] which start with a very few neurons\nand strategically add neurons and connections with learning\nuntil a stopping criterion is met. Hence, the ?nal result is\nimmune to bad initializations.\nFive datasets from the UCI machine learning repository\n[26] were used in our experiments \(see Table I mean std. dev advantage of TASONN and our\nmodel over k-means for initialization is revealed by the ?.\nOn average over all datasets, the classi?cation accuracies\nof Einha¨user et al.’s model and TASONN were 45%, k-\nmeans and our model were 64%, and the two supervised\nalgorithms were 74%.

Fig.\n3 shows the variation in performance of our model for\ndifferent values of ? for each dataset. The best performance\nis achieved at ? = 10?2; however, for natural data with more\noutliers, ? = 10?4 performs better as will be shown next.\nB. Hierarchical feature learning from images, videos, audio\nThe proposed model was deployed for learning feature\nhierarchies from data in different modalities in an unsuper-\nvised and online manner with no alteration to the learning\nalgorithm. The feedforward weights were learned layer by\nlayer with ?\(t t?1 1+t/106 0 second layers respectively. The top layer had only\none node. The number of nodes in each layer is a function\nof the percent overlaps and the RF sizes of neurons in the\ndifferent layers. The default value of was 10?2; a more\nappropriate value could be empirically determined for each\ndata set.\nFeatures for the second and third layers were recon-\nstructed as follows. For a neuron in the second layer, a\nneuron in each ?rst layer node that most strongly connected\nto it was chosen. The features represented by these neurons\nwere weighed by the connection strengths and spatially orga-\nnized taking into consideration the percent overlaps among\nnodes. Once the second layer features were constructed,\nthe same procedure was carried out for each third layer\nneuron to construct their features. To reconstruct unknown\ndata, a winner neuron was computed in each node in the\nhighest layer. A neuron in each node in the lower layers\nwas chosen based on strongest connection to the winner. The\nchosen lowest layer features, each multiplied by the norm of\nthe corresponding 


input data patch and spatially organized\nbased on the percent overlaps among nodes, reconstructed\nthe input.\n1 downloaded from Google Images highlight\nedges \(performed by center-surround cells before the signal\nreaches V1 [27 from 108 patches,\neach of size 10×10 pixels, in the ?rst layer. When ? = 10?4,\nthese features were edges/bars in different orientations and\nphases \(see Fig. 4\(a  the absence of a threshold to ignore\noutliers \(i.e. ? = 1 see Fig. 4\(b to RFs found in V2 [29], [30] \(see Fig. 4\(c show\nany coherent pattern.\nOur model also learned three layers of features from\n60,000 images of ten handwritten numerals {0, 1, ...9} from\nthe MNIST dataset [3]. As shown in Fig. 5, parts of numerals\nwere learned in ?rst layer, larger parts in the second layer,\nand whole numerals in the third layer. ? was chosen as 10?1\nfor MNIST. Each feature is the centroid of a cluster and\ncaptures the distribution of pixel intensities in its cluster. For\nnatural images, this distribution is Gabor-like \(see Fig. 4\(a natural images, desired results were produced for\na lower value of ? than that for MNIST as there were many\nmore outliers in the former dataset compared to the latter.\nThe same model could learn three layers of features from\nthe MNIST data but only two layers from natural images\ndue to the absence of recurring coincidences among second\nlayer features in the latter case.\n2 learned\nin our model from 3D voxels where time is the third\ndimension.

CONCLUSIONS\nManually studying and encoding features for discovery,\nrecognition or prediction is not always feasible given stream-\ning sensory data. In the past decade, a number of relatively\ncomplex models that require long training time to tune a\nlarge number of hyperparameters, have been proposed for\nlearning feature hierarchies. We have shown that a fully-\nlearnable model, with only two manually tunable parameters,\ncan learn rich meaningful feature hierarchies from repeating\ncoincidences in spatiotemporal data in different modalities\nin an online and unsupervised manner. The key feature was\nthe use of McCulloch-Pitts neuron model with a variable\nthreshold that is unique for each neuron and adaptive to\nthe data. A constant parameter was used to decay this\nthreshold such that the in?uence of outliers on learning\nmay be controlled. This is crucial for using the same model\nfor learning from data with different proportion of outliers,\nsuch as, natural images with a large number of outliers\nand clean handwritten numerals, as in MNIST dataset, with\nvery few outliers Learning was facilitated by the Hebbian\nrule and winner-take-all mechanism. Sparse coding offers\nmore explanatory power but is computationally less ef?cient\nthan the winner-take-all mechanism which is of primary\nimportance when dealing with Big Data at the lower levels\nof abstraction.\nOur network architecture consisted of a hierarchy of layers\nof nodes, a node being a canonical computational unit\nconsisting of an ensemble of neurons. We showed how our\nalgorithm, without any alteration, could learn the feedfor-\nward weights in this architecture which embody the features,\nfrom images, videos, and audio.

Operations in each layer of the\nmodel can be implemented in parallelized hardware, making\nit very ef?cient for real world Big Data applications. We\nconclude that the proposed model is an advisable solution\nfor the problem of discovering spatiotemporal objects in real\nworld Big Data in an unsupervised and online manner.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nResearch reported in this paper was partially supported\nby NSF CISE Grant No. 1231620 We thank Juan Gu and\nRavi P.

FROM\nTHE BEST \(p < 0.05 comparisons\nbegin to occur with same frequency and hence the advantages\nof ICE become less pronounced.\nFor our synthetic random-walk dataset ICE again generally\nprovided the best performance - but this time the results could\nnot be con?rmed to a statistically signi?cant level, even for\nlarger symbol sets. Note that in general the synthetic data\nprovided an easier task, with almost all methods performing\nbetter than for the real world energy data when quantizing\nto the same number of symbols. A potential explanation is\nthat the nature of the random walk means that the time series\nare more spread out in the space11, and hence it is easier to\ndiscriminate between time series in general. This results in\nless re?ned symbolizations \(with respect to comparisons closing the gap on the ICE quantizer\nas shown in the results. Finally, note that in this dataset the\nsymbol distributions for the time series are Gaussian, and this\nhelps promote the effectiveness of qSax.\nIt is worth also noting that aMSE \(which used the same core\nsimulated annealing algorithm as ICE, varying only the cost\nfunction chosen value of 900 for\nthe approximation of the continuous space in the GPU methods\nwas of an appropriate granularity. A ?nal observation is with\nregard to the poor performance of the MOE and Uniform\nquantizers Their consistent losses, and general inability to\nidentify the majority of nearest neighbours correctly, serve to\nhighlight that the consideration of quantization approach can\nbe vital to the effectiveness of data mining algorithms.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nMany quantization techniques which are thought of as\noptimal, are in fact only optimal within the context of a speci?c\nproblem domain such as signal reconstruction. In this work we\nhave shown that in the extremely prevalent case where quan-\ntized input is used as the basis for time-series comparisons,\nstandard approaches can lead to potential performance loss. To\naddress this issue we have presented a novel quantizer \(ICE computationally tractable implementation\neffective to large data. Our empirical results based upon three\ndifferent datasets \(and using various time-series lengths and\nsymbol-set cardinalities initial evidence for the\nsuperiority of ICE for comparison-based data mining tasks.\nEven though one might expect the assumptions that underpins\nICE to be violated by many real-world datasets, our results\nhave indicated that even when such violations occur our\nquantizer can still provide superior performance to current\nstate-of-the-art quantization approaches.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was funded by the RCUK Horizon Digital\nEconomy Research Hub grant, EP/G065802/1.\n11The variance in the pairwise distances between the original time series\nin the random walk dataset was over double that of the electricity dataset.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
