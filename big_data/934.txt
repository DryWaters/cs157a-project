   Figure 1: Conceptual model of virtual community life cycle  As shown in the life cycle model, the life of a virtual community is influenced by four elements  namely socially shaped aspects, individually demonstrated characteristics, technologically facilitated features, and the external media. However this is a dynamic cycle. While prior literature emphasizes the impact of various factors on participation in a predominantly positivist approach we argue that the existence of the virtual community in turn influences the various elements that affect it  thus begging a process oriented, emergent approach Hence, as the life of a virtual community changes there are changes in socially shaped aspects such as the size of the community, its critical mass, scope and culture. As the life of a virtual community changes individually demonstrated characteristics such as tangible and intangible returns and utility may change. For example, a community with high participation could be more valuable and helpful to a member than a community with low participation. As the life of a virtual community changes, technologies may evolve to support the changing needs of the members. For example Facebook allows third-party lightweight applications to be plugged in to members profiles if desired. Finally, as the life of a virtual community changes, external factors such as the interest of media in the virtual community may change This model has implications for research in virtual communities. While there is little attention paid to dead communities, i.e. communities that have low active participation, the conceptual model proposes that such communities have the potential to be revived based on the four elements. We next discuss specific implications and avenues for future research  4. Discussion and Future Research  In this paper, we focus on an important but underresearched topic the life cycle of virtual communities. We draw on the plethora of existing literature on virtual communities that adopt different approaches to studying factors affecting membership and participation. In arriving at a holistic conceptual model, we suggest that the phenomenon be looked at from an emergent, constructivist perspective, rather than a positivist one. We identify the elements Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


associated with the life cycle of a virtual community The conceptual model has implications for research and practice in virtual communities The conceptual model can be used as a sensitizing lens for specific virtual communities and make sense of their nature. Future research can delve into each element and shed light to specific characteristics, or trace their evolution over time. A longitudinal study of a virtual community would help in further understanding the dynamics of the life cycle model  C o m p arin g  v i rt u al co m m u n i t i es t h at are alive  with those that are dead and conducting a crosscase analysis would help contrast the elements in both contexts. The conceptual model can be enhanced by future research that adds more elements or further refines each. One of the limitations of this study is that we have not identified specific stages within the life cycle of a virtual community Empirically investigating various types of virtual communities or different contexts in which virtual communities may exist would help identify specific stages within the life of those virtual communities  o r ex a m ple, [33] d e lv es i n to dis e ng a g e m e n t \(i.e the stage when members leave\rom a virtual community. Our study is intended to be a starting point for a discussion of the phenomenon of the life cycle of virtual communities  5.

clarification concerning the best practices within this topic seems necessary, as mishandling of secondary storage media is likely to result in lost or inadmissible data In addition to the two topics discussed above, it is also interesting to note that of the ten tasks identified as having the highest level of conflict between the panels, scores indicating high conflict within one panel occurred in six of them. Additionally, three tasks were identified as having high conflict within the panel of technical experts and within the panel of legal experts. Of those three tasks, tasks 22 and 56 were discussed above; however, task 64, regarding filtering data based on attorney-client privilege prior to imaging, does not fit into the two topics discussed above. For task 64, one member of the technical panel indicated that it is absolutely essential, one member of the legal panel indicated that the task is desired, three members of the technical panel and two members of the legal panel indicated that it is undesired, and one member of the technical panel and two members of the legal panel indicated that is absolutely prohibited. This high value of conflict within both panels illustrates confusion in an area concerning e-discovery matters, and this is an area that is thought will experience high growth rates within the next several years. Computer forensics examiners will be well-served by additional clarification concerning best practices in e-discovery matters too  4. Conclusions  Our analysis of the data resulted in several interesting findings involving agreement and conflict among experts of computer forensics. Although the observations are interesting, our findings are bound by several limitations, and we see the need for more work to be done on this topic. We will summarize our observations, discuss limitations of our study, and present a call for additional research below  4.1. Summary of observations  It is interesting to note the differences in the levels of agreement observed from the various experts that participated in this study. While it is relatively easy to understand that some of the differences are due to the different perspectives from which the legal experts and the technical experts were asked to evaluate the tasks, there were many differences among each group, as well as differences between the groups. Also, from the complete set of 103 tasks evaluated, only 26 tasks achieved a level of high agreement among all of the experts, representing only 25% of the tasks Tasks where general agreement occurred within each group of experts, yet conflicting ratings occurred between the groups were observed however, this condition accounted for just under 10 of the total tasks evaluated. For example, only 10 tasks from the set of 103 tasks represent conditions where agreement occurred among the members of each panel, and the two panels reached conflicting results.  Although the differences in ratings between panels can be explained through the specific conditions from which each panel evaluates tasks differences between members within a panel of experts is more difficult to rationalize, and it occurred more frequently than did the instances where agreement occurred within panels yet conflict occurred between panels. In 16.5% of the tasks evaluated, members of the panel of legal experts reached conflicting ratings whereby at least one member felt very strongly that the task should be performed while at least one other member of the panel strongly felt that the task should not be performed. Even more conflicting was the level of disagreement among the members of the panel of technical experts, as they reached conflicting ratings in 17.5% of the tasks The level of conflict identified in this study cannot be attributed to one panel member providing outlying responses, as only one task among the subset of tasks that highly aligned \(i.e., those shown in Table 3. Top rated tasks\ was included in the subset of tasks with largest conflicts \(i.e., Table 4. Largest technical and legal conflicts\This task, task 10 concerned testing forensic software tools Overall, the large extent of conflict among forensic computer experts raises concern regarding reaching predictable outcomes when used in legal matters.  Forensic science is based upon using a measureable, scientific process to reach an unbiased conclusion, yet as this study illustrates, different forensic computer experts frequently do not reach the same conclusion concerning the importance to forensic task performance  4.2. Limitations  Although we attempted to be thorough in our analysis, it is important to note that numerous limitations exist, especially concerning the data collected. This study limited its survey population to the HTCIA; therefore, bias from the study population may impact th  How e v e r, it is  thought that opinions of experts within an organization, such as the HTCIA, are more likely to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


align than would opinions from a more diverse group of experts, thus measures of conflict are thought to be conservative in this report Also, concerning respondent bias, this study generated its output from a limited number of responses.  Non-respondents expressed reasons for not participating that included distrust, being too busy, vacation, and difficulty authenticating themselves on the survey s Website.  Invalid e-mail addresses and spam blocking filters also contributed to the reduction of responses [8  The set of 103 tasks presented within this report are not implied to represent a comprehensive set of tasks forensic examiners perform pertaining to the forensic data acquisition of personal computer workstations.  This set of tasks is limited to those that were identified by respondents of this study.  No conditional logic regarding the performance of tasks is suggested nor is the sequence of the performance of tasks  4.3. Call for additional research  Given the importance of expert testimony in legal proceedings and the level of conflict among forensic computer experts revealed within this study, more study is needed to develop a better understanding of the causes of conflict and solutions to reduce conflict For example, future studies may identify beneficial solutions from licensing organizations, industry standards, mandatory training, or legislation regarding the credentials of forensic computer examiners. Clearly, the inconsistency among forensic computer examiners opinions identified within this study illustrates a weakness within our legal system that has the potential to alter trail outcomes, thus allowing the guilty to be acquitted and the not-guilty to be wrongly convicted  5.

Scenario 7 Figure 3 Plots for the frame size distributions for the various scenarios along with the as the SCaN simulator based was available 11 I Frames P Frames B Frames T  I-1 a-2--a 0 0 0 0 0 m on Qualnet 4 TELEMETRY TRAFFIC MODEL Telemetry transmissions from the spacecraft to the command center generally take as follows First some are aperiodic These traffic may represent various instrumentation measurements sensory outputs file downloads etc On the right side of the picture was not partitioned into sub-channels but rather data was transmitted only when it we come to the following conclusions about the packet size distribution for this type of encoding scheme  In the we present we determine the statistical distribution of the type of video which we are interested in transmitting As we note from the above picture the telemetry transmission wastes one can use the traffic synthesizing tool to generate random traffic whose frame statistical distribution approximates the distribution of the traffic which a lot of bandwidth when a lot or blue sky the size of the I frames is relatively small see scenarios 1 4  In the are much smaller than those of I frames see scenarios 1,2,5,6,7  If the main object in the picture is moving quite are multiplexed together Some of these traffics are constant bit rate are described by on the above data a large evenly painted surface a file in a large amount of bandwidth The type of traffic that generally is being transmitted via a telemetry channel is formed by multiple types of traffic which so that each telemetry data has its a particular sub-channel For this reason cases the telemetry transmission will look something like in Figure 5 Contrary to Figure 4 right side in Figure 5 the channel own designated sub-channel see Figure 4 For example in the left side of Figure 4 can be used by network simulation tools such we are interested in analyzing This synthesized traffic generated by we designate each telemetry type to we have seen one can model the frame sizes of the different type of frames by gamma approximations Based or there is very little detail in the pictures i.e the pictures are of even if the picture has many objects with rich detail the sizes of P and B frames even if the background is rather stationary the distribution of the frame sizes is much thicker i.e having higher variance see scenarios 3,4,7 Video synthesis In this section a video synthesizer for MPEG v4 encoded video which has been developed in order to generate sample traffic for live video transmissions The synthesizing of the video traffic is done a gamma distribution Using the tools developed above on preexisting traffic of the type we are interested to transmit one can find the parameters of the gamma distribution which best fit this type of traffic Given the parameters determined by those tools our tool is outputted to a format which some are periodic in nature while others may be event based non-periodic The classical approach to telemetry is to schedule the transmission we see multiple types of traffic some of which a constant bit rate some are periodic and we see the traffic being fit through a channel which has been partitioned into sub-channels Figure 4 Traffic allocated to dedicated channels As a more desirable approach would be to multiplex together all of the transmissions In such case in which the background for the video is dark case in which there is little movement in the background 


Figure 5 Statistically multiplexed traffic We note that in this case we would be able to utilize some of the free channel space for other types of transmissions which may be more delay tolerant see Figure 6 For example in this figure the bottom blue transmission can be thought to be a file which is packetized and needs to be transmitted down from the spacecraft We consider this file to be delay tolerant i.e the data is not needed right away down on the ground and it has a lower priority then the other traffics needed to be transmitted The delay tolerant packets will be transmitted only when the channel is not being fully utilized as to fill in the gaps available in the channel bandwidth This technique will delay the arrival of the delay tolerant traffic but will enable us to more fully utilize our channel bandwidth m T]T m Figure 6 Telemetry traffic along with delay tolerant traffic being sent via a channel We note in above scenario that although the delay tolerant traffic was transmitted at time 0 none of it was able to be transmitted until time 1 Also we note that the final delay tolerant traffic packet was transmitted 9 time instances later then it was received For this reason a buffering scheme must be devised such that all the delay tolerant traffic may be buffered until enough bandwidth for transmission exists Since no specific data was available on the dynamics of the various telemetry type traffics we developed a generic telemetry model which is formed by two types of traffic one constant bit rate which represents the sensory information which is constantly being transmitted down to the ground and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents file download and periodic data updates We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to telemetry constant bit rate  peak of intermittent transmission We will also assume that the intermittent transmission file transfer will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new files are ready to be transferred Using the above model we created a Matlab based tool for synthesizing traffic for simulation purposes The traffic generated by this tool is output to a file in a format which can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 5 COMMAND TRAFFIC MODEL The model for the command will be similar in spirit to the model which we have proposed for telemetry We see the data transmitted for command to be formed by two different types of transmission One constant bit rate which represents calls to various preloaded spacecraft subroutines and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents subroutine uploads to the spacecraft We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to command and we also assume that the intermittent transmission subroutine upload will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new subroutines are ready to be transferred Using this model we have developed a Matlab based traffic synthesizing tool The traffic provided by this tool can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 6 CONCLUSIONS This work has resulted in the development of a suite of traffic models that captures the fundamental types that will be in the space communications environment and in particular These models provide the capability to investigate the new IP-based communications functions and resulting performance that are required by the human exploration missions of NASA's Constellation Program and the Space Communications and Navigation SCaN network's ability to support them Four prototypical traffic models have been developed from which any number of streams may be generated 1 audio/voice 2 real-time motion imager live video 3 telemetry including both regular periodic data as well as intermittent file downloads and 4 command including periodic data as well as intermittent subroutine uploads The voice traffic model stochastically parameterizes calls talk times and talk spurts Multiple audio analysis tools were developed to assist in the derivation of parameters from data samples taken from relevant space missions Using these tools parameters of probability distributions were fit to data taken from Shuttle/ISS archives 12     n 


The characterization of motion imagery video traffic involved the stochastic characterization of I P B-frames of MPEG-4 sequences Several Matlab tools were developed to support video analyses wherein ISS and Shuttle specific mission video sequences were used to derive parameters for the associated model A general stochastic model was derived for data telemetry enabling broad parametric applicability ranging among constant bit stream periodic or bursty patterns This same general model through proper selection of parameters may also be used to model command data flow traffic Matlab programs were developed to enable each of the traffic types above to be synthesized and saved into a file for use by SCaN simulation for performance analyses Example flows were generated for a LEO case and an Ascent case and results illustrated using the SCaN Simulator These analyses show the need for such traffic models to determine packet loss including speech intelligibility and latency arising from both statistical multiplexing and potential use of DiffServ prioritization techniques when peak offered loads may undergo transient overload conditions 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration REFERENCES 1 Esther Jennings and David Heckman Architecture Modeling and Performance Characterization of Space Communications and Navigation SCaN Network using MACHETE submitted to 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 1-8 2008 2 Michael Hammer and James Champy Reengineering the Corporation New York Harper Business 1993 3 G Edward Bryan Not All Programmers Are Created Equal 1994 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings February 5-12 1994 4 Voice Activity Detection Using Generalized Gamma Distribution in Advances in Artificial Intelligence part of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3955 2006 5 Athina Markopoulou Fouad Tobagi and Mansour Karam Assessment of VoIP quality over Internet backbones In Proceedings of INFOCOM 2002 6 John Daigle and Joseph Langford Models for Analysis of Packet Voice Communications Systems IEEE JSAC SAC-4 6 1986 7 Harold Stem and Kim-Kwok Wong Modeling the on-off patterns in conversational speech including short silence gaps and the effects of interaction between speaking parties Vehicular Technology Conference 1994 8 0 Rose Statistical Properties of MPEG video traffic and their impact on traffic modeling in ATM systems Institute of Computer Science Report 101 University of Wurzburg 1995 BIOGRAPHY Tudor Stoenescu received a BS in Electrical Engineering  and an MS in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 1999 and a MSE and PhD in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2001 and 2004 respectively After receiving his PhD Dr Stoenescu accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position in Information Science and Technology at California Institute of Technology In 2006 Dr Stoenescu joined the Telecommunications Architecture Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dr Stoenescu's current research interests lie 13
