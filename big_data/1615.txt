Storage Mining: Where IT Management Meets Big\nData Analytics\nYang Song, Gabriel Alatorre, Nagapramod Mandagere, and Aameek Singh\nIBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA 95120\nEmail:{yangsong, galatorr, pramod aameek.singh}@us.ibm.com\nAbstract—The emerging paradigm shift to cloud based data\ncenter infrastructures imposes remarkable challenges to IT\nmanagement operations, e.g., due to virtulization techniques and\nmore stringent requirements for cost and efficiency. On one hand,\nthe voluminous data generated by daily IT operations such as logs\nand performance measurements contain abundant information\nand insights which can be leveraged to assist the IT management.\nOn the other hand, traditional IT management solutions cannot\nconsume and exploit the rich information contained in the data\ndue to the daunting volume, velocity, variety, as well as the lack of\nscalable data mining and machine learning frameworks to extract\ninsights from such raw data. In this paper, we present our on-\ngoing research thrust of designing novel IT management solutions\nby leveraging big data analytics frameworks. As an example,\nwe introduce our project of Storage Mining, which exploits big\ndata analytics techniques to facilitate storage cloud management.\nThe challenges are discussed and our proof-of-concept big data\nanalytics framework is presented.\nI. IT MANAGEMENT AS A BIG DATA PROBLEM STORAGE\nMINING EXAMPLE\nEach minute, approximately 48 hours of video will be\nuploaded to Youtube. The overwhelming surge of newly gen-\nerated data skyrockets the demand for storage. Nevertheless,\nthe storage budget for IT administrations remains flat, if not\ndecreasing, and hence it is strongly desirable and imperative\nto design storage management solutions that are both efficient\nand cost-effective. In this paper we introduce our Storage\nMining project, as an example of our on-going research on\ndesigning next generation IT management solutions that are\nsuitable for big data systems and can also benefit from big\ndata techniques Due to the space limit, we use one case\nstudy, namely, proactive tiering, to demonstrate how big\ndata analytics techniques can be utilized to facilitate storage\noptimization and IT management in general.\nA Proactive Tiering: A Case Study\nStorage Information Lifecycle Management \(ILM that focuses on moving less accessed storage\nvolumes \(e.g., virtual disks in storage virtualization [1 to\nlow-end storage devices in order to free up space on high-\nend devices with superb performance, e.g better response\ntime and throughput. The categorization of storage volumes\nis termed as tiering. For example the admin can measure\nthe average \(or peak IOPS past month, denoted by Ik,\nand calculates its I/O density as dk = IkSk , where Sk is the\nvolume size. If dk falls in a range determined by predetermined\nthresholds, storage volume k is labeled as the tier associated\nwith that range. After tier labeling, the admin will check\nwhether the volume resides on a storage device with an\nappropriate tier. For example, if a high tier volume \(frequently\naccessed low-end storage device, an up-\ntiering operation will be executed, i.e., the storage volume\nwill be migrated to a high-end \(tier access\npattern of each volume is time varying and thus the above\nprocess is performed periodically to capture the storage load\nvariations. Note that the aforementioned tiering operations are\nreactive, i.e., the tiering decisions are made based on past\nIOPS observations.\nFig. 1. Information Lifecycle Management \(ILM Storage Tiering.\nIn Storage Mining, we are investigating a new ILM solution\nbased on proactive tiering, i.e using predictive analytics to\nforecast the IOPS values in the next L hours \(we focus on\nIOPS since the size of storage volume usually changes in a\nmuch slower time scale observed recent IOPS values as vector I¯\(t e.g., last\nweek I˜\(L L nI¯\(t predicted I˜\(L storage load, in a proactive fashion.\nB. Predictive Analytics\nWe now provide a brief summary of our predictive analytics\nsolution. We collect the historical IOPS data \(e.g., two months utilize this time series as the\ntraining data set for our predictive analytics. We utilize ensem-\nble methods to improve the prediction accuracy. In specific, we\nuse bagging \(bootstrap aggregating  aggregate\nmultiple predictive models, including\n1 favor models that capture high IOPS accurately1.\nIn addition, we apply LASSO regulation to alleviate\noverfitting, and the optimal penalty weight \(the weight\nof LASSO term cross-validation.\n2 Poisson Poisson link function.\n1From a storage admin’s standpoint, accurate prediction of high IOPS is\nmore desirable compared to predictions of low IOPS.\n2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data\n978-0-7695-5006-0/13 $26.00 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.66\n421\n3 SVM\nmethod applied for regression instead of classification.\n4 network.\n5 


contains inherent\nensemble principles when combining multiple trees [3].\nFor each storage volume, we collect the historical perfor-\nmance data and apply aforementioned predictive analytics to\ncreate the forecasting model. In a typical data center, however,\nthe number of storage volumes can be tens of thousands and\nbeyond The following challenges must be addressed by our\nframework before practical deployments.\nC. Big Data Challenges\n1 provides 20\nperformance metrics such as IOPS, response time, and\ncache hit ratio, an hourly sampling strategy will yield 33\nmillion data points per week, which will keep increasing\nas the data center operates. The voluminous performance\ndata need to be stored reliably and made available to the\npredictive analytics engine on demand.\n2 predictive model\ntraining process for all 10k storage volumes, which\nis computationally prohibitive for traditional machine\nlearning toolkits, since the prediction models should be\nupdated as quickly as possible for effective predictions.\nIn this work, we exploit NoSQL database and Hadoop-based\nmachine learning frameworks to address these challenges.\nII. OUR PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PLATFORM\nA. Hadoop & Cassandra Cluster\nFor our project, we utilize Hadoop as the back-end compu-\ntation platform to facilitate the computational-intensive model\ntraining process in predictive analytics. Our proof-of-concept\nplatform consists of a 7 node Hadoop cluster \(1 master and\n6 slaves we install Cassandra [4] on the same set of nodes in\nthe Hadoop cluster to achieve data locality. Compared to other\nNoSQL alternatives, Cassandra is fully distributed and has no\ncentral point of failure, i.e., it favors availability and partition\ntolerance in the CAP Theorem [5], rather than consistency,\nwhich fits well in our scenario. For a detailed comparison of\nCassandra and other NoSQL solutions, refer to [6].\nB. Scalable Machine Learning Framework\nFor the scalable machine learning platform, we deploy the\nRHadoop framework [7] on top of our Hadoop & Cassandra\ncluster. First, we install R and related packages on all nodes\nin the cluster. Second we implement the predictive analytics\ndescribed in previous section in the RHadoop framework, i.e.,\nin MapReduce format, where each mapper can handle the pre-\ndictive model building process for one single storage volume.\nIn other words, the computationally intensive predictive model\ntraining process \(for all storage volumes in the data center, e.g.,\n10k fashion, using Hadoop streaming functionality.\nThe overall architecture of our big data analytics platform is\nillustrated in Figure 2. A back-end script periodically collects\nthe measured performance data of all storage volumes in the\ndata center, e.g., once a week. The collected data will be\nstored in Cassandra for query and processing, and a separate\ncopy of IOPS time series data will be loaded to HDFS for\nthe scalable machine learning framework to consume. Our\npredictive model training script, written in R and RHadoop\nframework, will train/update predictive models based on the\ncollected historical data, e.g., last two months, and the trained\nmodel will be saved in HDFS as an R object. A web-based UI\nis hosted on the web server for user interactions, where a user\ncan input the recent IOPS observations \(e.g., last week future IOPS based on the trained model available\nin HDFS.\nAs a simple example, we collect hourly IOPS data of 20k\nstorage volumes for two months and use these data as training\nsets for our predictive analytics in Section I-B. We first write a\nsingle-threaded R script, running on a single node, to train the\nmodels for all volumes exhaustively, and the overall training\nprocess finishes in around 80 minutes in order to obtain models\nfor all volumes. In contrast, we implement the same algorithms\nin our RHadoop platform, and the training process completes\nin less than 10 minutes. The job completion time reduction\nbecomes more significant as the number of storage volumes\nor the length of training time series data increases.\nFig. 2. Overview of Our PoC Big Data Analytics Platform.\nIII. ON-GOING RESEARCH\nWe are implementing other use cases of the Storage Mining\nframework such as storage consolidation planning using corre-\nlation information among storage volumes. In addition, we are\ninvestigating other big data machine learning platforms such\nas Apache Mahout [8], RHIPE [9], Ricardo 10], IBM Big-\nInsight with SystemML [11], and leveraging such platforms\nin other IT management aspects such as server and network\nmanagement.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y.

fixed. Using this relationship between \nthe conscious and subconscious, mental illness can be \nunderstood as the \(slow inability to meet the needs of the \nsubconscious . The subconscious does this slowly by \nchanging the chemical interactions that occur throughout the \nbrain as the brain and the brain stem are exposed to the \nharsh chemicals released while the FOFR is activated . .  \nThe conscious mind developed from the subconscious and nthe subconscious relies on the conscious mind for many \nthings .  The subconscious does not duplicate the abilities that \nthe conscious provides a person. It does maintain mastery \nover the conscious mind and will disable" the conscious \nmind when it determines its self-preservation is in j eopardy \nand at other times too When the subconscious replaces the \nconscious mind, the behavior of the person ranges from the \ninane to the arcane, which includes the insane . \nMental illness is initiated with depression and if the person \nwith depression does not make changes it their life that the \nsubconscious demands be made, the person will slowly step \nthrough several more serious changes in brain chemistry \nthat often overlap with symptoms \(please see sections VIII \nthrough XII eluded the mental health \ncommunity, but the treatment of the symptoms from mental \nillness has greatly improved over the past 50 years with the \nuse of powerful brain-chemistry altering drugs developed by \nthe pharmaceutical industry. \nJust as the subconscious may take a long time \(several \nyears the person's  conscious mind, the \nconscious mind will require even more time to reestablish \nitself as a partner with the subconscious by convincing the \nsubconscious that the conscious mind will meet the needs of nthe subconscious in the future . This is usually accomplished \nin mental health rehabilitation facilities nThe diagnoses and treatments for mental illness lag other \nmedical practices of injuries and disease of the rest of the \nbody. The delay originates from a decision made the by the \nRoman Catholic church over three hundreds of years ago \nwhen the church held great influence over what people did \nand did not do . This decision forced physicians to treat \ninjuries and disease of the physical body and to ignore the \nbrain because the church believed that a person' s brain was \nthe source a person ' s  spiritual connection. This belief was \nbased on the work by a French physiologist, Renee \nDescartes, resulting in the belief that the physical body \ncould be treated separately from the brain and a person's \nnervous system. \n?Severe? \nEmotional nDIstress \(SED nMentally .11 I Balanced \n\\ \n+ &w?? \nDistressed \nEmotionally Heall n 9 sell·management """"-- ?

THE CAUSE OF MENTAL ILLNESS \nUnlike the physical body, the brain cannot be removed from \nthe skull bone, treated and allowed to heal. [1I]The brain is \nessential to all our daily functions in whatever condition it is \noperating. When faced with a threatening situation, the \nhuman body has a built-in behavior we call the fight-or­\nflight response \(FOFR center \nof the brain where it is well protected. The FOFR is the \nsingle most powerful part of the brain. The FOFR .",:as \ndeveloped for extremely brief durations due to the toxIcIty \nof the chemicals released and created in the FOFR's \nresponse to threats. \nThe brain does provide some early warning signs to a \nperson that the messages from the FOFR are being ignored; \nthese early signs of insensitivity to the FOFR messages are noften misdiagnosed as allergies or ignored altogether. The \nvery early warning signs that are usually misunderstood and \noverlooked and ignored and includes conditions in or on the \nsurface of the body that appear suddenly, disappear just as \nquickly and so are extremely difficult to associate with any \none action These include such conditions as chapped lips, \npsoriasis, acid indigestion/heartburn, hemorrhoids, mouth nlips, cheek and/or tongue sores. These occur when the \nFOFR decides to reduce the effectiveness of the immune nsystem allowing what foreign bodies that have inhabited the \nbody to go unchecked to some minor degree. \nThe key hormone elicited when the FOFR is activated \nincludes adrenaline, also known as epinephrine and nneurotransmitters like noradrenalin and norepinephrine. The \nhormones trigger several systems to prepare the body to face \nwhatever the perceived threats are. The result is increased \n5 \nheart and breathing rate. This serves to ready the body for \nincreased oxygen consumption on the case of flight. Blood \nis also diverted from the non-essential systems, such as the \nlymphatic system, stomach and intestines. Blood ves:els \ndirect flow to the muscles required for the fight-or-fllght \nresponse. The body also releases nutrients required ?o nsustain muscular activity. The result is a human body that IS \nset for intense muscular effort. The response continues until \nthe threat is resolved. \nFigure 5. The Brains FOFR System \nIf a person is placed in a chronically threatening \nenvironment, the person's fight-or-flight response \nmechanism stays activated. This constant activation can \ncause a weakened immune system, an over worked heart, a \nvariety of stomach problems and depression. This evidence \nloosely links stress and depression. Once the threatening \nsituation passes 


the brain triggers an adrenaline crash, \nwhich triggers the relaxation response. An increase in \nadrenaline levels leads to an increase in cortisol. Cortisol is \nanother fight-or-flight response hormone that is linked to the \ndeath of all cells that it comes in contact. [9] Brain cells are \ndestroyed quicker than other cells and are not replaced once \ndamaged. However, parts of the brain neural seem to be \nrepaired or replaced Cortisol can also lower sensitivity to \npain, help you to surviv,e grief, or pull you through a short-. [b term pressure proJect. \nUnlike adrenaline levels, which decrease rapidly after the \nstressful situation has passed, cortisol levels increase slowly \nand decrease slowly. Cortisol stays in the system longer \nthan adrenaline, continually exerting its effect. Cortisol \nincreases blood pressure and blood sugar levels to aid in the \nfight or flight response. \nFigure 6 and Figure 7 illustrate the changes to the brain and \nbrain stem tissue from long-term exposure to the chemicals \nreleased by the brains FOFR. Degradation and degeneration \nof the central serotonergic neurotransmission, particularly \nchanges in the presynaptically located serotonin transporter \n\(SERT ntechniques such as single-photon emission computed \ntomography and positron emission tomography employ \nradio labeled tracers, which bind to SERT, and thus, allow \nidentification of the decrease in cerebral SERT availability. \nFigure 6. An Image of a Area of the Brain where the \nFOFR Resides with Atrophy after being Subjected to \nLong Term Exposure to Adrenaline and Cortisol \ncausing Mental Illness \nFigure 7. Magnetic Resonance Images \(left column SPECT middle column right side upper row Midbrain \nRegion \(middle row bottom row Brain and \nBrain Stem Tissue as a Result of Chemical Damage from \nthe FOFR. 6 \n6 \nThe SERT images from patients with depression, anxiety \ndisorders, eating disorders and patients with neurological \ndiseases illustrated damaged tissue from the FOFR. SERT \nimaging techniques identified the degradation of selective nserotonin reuptake-inhibitors from the FOFR. [6] For a body \nwith the FOFR activated continuously, adrenaline and \ncortisol are secreted constantly at variable levels. This leads, \nto among other conditions, the increased levels of fatty acids \nin the blood vessels \(cortisol signals the metabolism of fatty \nacids to produce and emergency supply of energy cause depression. The data is still inconclusive. \nHowever, data shows that people who have high levels of ncortisol are sometimes but not always exhibit symptoms of \ndepression. Mental illness occurs when the hypothalamus or \nthalamus is degraded or damaged from the continuous \npresence of the chemicals it releases when the FOFR is \nactivated causing accelerated aging. Normally, the brain \nmaintains the correct chemistry managing the three most \ninfluential chemicals associated with normal behavior. \nThese chemicals include serotonin, dopamine and \nnorepinephrine. \nThe FOFR is activated by the thalamus and hypothalamus \nbecause the thalamus is the main relay through which all \nincoming sensory information passes before being sent to \nthe cerebral cortex and distributed to other areas of the \nbrain. It is the thalamus and hypothalamus and the region \nnearby that is believed to be the source of the FOFR that \nidentifies a threat from all the sensory information that is \ncentralized there. It is the thalamus and surrounding region \nthat filters all the incoming sensory information and decides \nwhich information is sent to the conscious. \nThe FOFR can remain activated but at very low level, \ncontinuously releasing the chemicals used by the FOFR to \nescape danger Almost all illness and disease can be caused \nfrom the long-term presence of the harmful chemicals in the nbody created by the FOFR. These include: heart disease, \nchronic fatigue, anxiety attacks, mood swings npsychological distress, depression, sleep problems, high \nblood pressure, eating disorders, peptic ulcers depressed \nimmune function, over reactive immune system functioning, \nchronic pain, colds, flu, viruses headaches, migraines, \nalcoholism, respiratory disease, allergies, cancer, MS, \nParkinson's, digestive track diseases and heart attack. \nSome believe that there is a mental illness gene or that \nmental illness in inherited. This common occurrence can be \nexplained using the FOFR An explanation for when family \nmembers contract mental illness is that we cannot be aware \nof the criteria that our FOFR's use to decide how much nthreat is too much and how long is too long. It is more likely \nthat parents that suffer mental illness will create a similar \nenvironment that they experienced developing mental \nillness for their offspring and so parents are more likely to \nrecreate a similar or even more threatening environment for \ntheir children, which may exceed their children's FOFR \nthreshold for developing mental illness. \nv. THE FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT RESPONSE nWith the redundant sections of the brain used for a variety \nof functions on a full time or part time basis the \ndevelopment for self-preservation received the highest \npriority. Self-preservation is raised to the highest of all \nfunctions the brain does. The brains ability for self­\npreservation is named the fight-or-flight response" \(FOFR 


a threat either exists or is going to \nexist soon. \nThe FOFR developed to be invoked in early-man for nextremely short durations, on the order a 300 milliseconds. \nThis was usually sufficient time for the body to take action \nthe hypothalamus decided was necessary. The hypothalamus \nis what is referred to as a ruled-based system. When the \nthalamus identifies a threat, then the body is ordered to take \naction, often running away from the threat. To produce the \nFOFR, the hypothalamus is allowed to take control all \nsystems of the brain and body to any degree it determines \nnecessary for safety. The FOFR is the most powerful section \nof brain for brief durations and is the only section of the \nbrain given such power. When the FOFR identifies danger nit activates at least two systems: the sympathetic nervous \nsystem and the adrenal-cortical system. The FOFR releases \nthe most powerful and destructive chemicals in the body \nthat are intended to be used for a very brief time to escape \ndanger. The sympathetic nervous system uses nerve \npathways to initiate reactions in the body, and the adrenal­\ncortical system uses the bloodstream. The combined effects \nof these two systems implement the desired actions of the \nFOFR. \nFigure 8. Three Examples of U.S. Presidents that Aged nPrematurely after taking Office. 1121 \nAt the same time, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin­\nreleasing factor \(CRF the \n7 \nhormone ACTH \(adreno-corticotropic hormone cortex, where it \nactivates the release of approximately 30  different hormones \nthat prepares the body to react to a threat. The sudden flood \nof epinephrine, norepinephrine and dozens of other \nhormones causes changes in the body that include: \n• Heart rate and blood pressure rise excessively \n• Pupils dilate to take in as much light as possible \n• Veins in skin constrict to send more blood to major \nmuscle groups responsible for the "chill" sometimes \nassociated with fear -- less blood in the skin to keep it \nwarm Blood-glucose level increases \n• Muscles tense up, energized by adrenaline and glucose \n\(responsible for goose bumps -- when tiny muscles \nattached to each hair on surface of skin tense up, the \nhairs are forced upright pulling skin with them systems \(like digestion and immune \nsystem focusing on small tasks \(brain is directed to \nfocus only on big picture in order to determine where \nthreat is coming from to the hypothalamus, \nwhich secretes "releasing hormones", as they stimulate the \npituitary gland to secrete hormones \( a chemical messenger \nfrom one cell [or a group of cells] to another. The anterior \nlobe of the pituitary gland secretes a wide variety of \nhormones, including "tropic hormones" which stimulate \nother endocrine glands. The adrenal gland releases \ncorticosteroids and catecholamines. The adrenal medulla nreleases the catecholamine adrenal in. The adrenal cortex \nzona glomerulos secretes mineralocorticoids mainly \naldosterone. The zona fasciculata secretes corticosteroids, \namong them cortisol, a hormone that regulates every organ \nand tissue function. The zona reticularis: secretes androgens \nsuch as testosterone The hypothalamus secretes \ncorticotropin releasing hormone and arginine vasopressin, \nwhich stimulate the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland to \nrelease adrenocorticotropic hormone or ACTH. \nFigure 9.

A Theorized Fight-or-Flight Response \nTriggered by the FOFRIHypothalamus. \nACTH causes the adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids, \nprimarily cortisol which enhances metabolism in a number \nof ways. It stimulates the release of amino acids from the \nbody and stimulates lipolysis or the breakdown of fat. It \nstimulates the release of gluconeogenesis from the newly \nreleased amino acids and fatty acids that conserve glucose \nby inhibiting its uptake into muscle and fat cells. It releases \ncortisol increasing blood sugar. It forces a rise in blood \npressure and suppresses the immune system and suppressing ninflammation. In summary, the overall effect is a person that \ncan run and react faster with more endurance see better due \nto the dilation of the pupils, hear more acutely and think \nfaster than it could before the cascade of reactions. Excess \nwaste may be voided and food present in the stomach may \nbe vomited to be lighter. However, all bodily functions not \nneeded for the immediate survival are shut down such as ndigestion, reproduction and immunity. This is where \nchronic FOFR or stress of long duration begins to have a ndeleterious effect leading to high blood pressure and type 2 \ndiabetes. Both of these may result in arteriosclerosis leading \nin turn to heart disease, stroke and premature death. \nInflammation is suppressed by preventing phospholipid \nrelease, decreasing eosinophil action and various other \nmechanisms. \nQi \nco > \n150 n.?? g> ? 100 \n«> 0 \nTIE \nc/i!? 50 \n2030 0430 1230 2 30 \nTime of day \nFigure 1 1 .

THE BIOLOGY OF THE FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT \nRESPONSE nNormally, when a person is in a serene, relaxed state, the \n"fIring" of neurons in the locus ceruleus is minimal. A novel \nstimulus \(which could include just a perception of danger or \nan environmental threat signal such as elevated sound levels \nor over-illumination, once perceived by the thalamus, is \nrelayed from the sensory cortex of the brain directly to the \nbrain stem without going through the conscious part of the nbrain. That route increases the rate of noradrenergic activity \nin the locus ceruleus, and the person becomes alert and \nattentive to the environment. Similarly, an abundance of \ncatecholamines at neuroreceptor sites facilitates reliance on \nspontaneous or intuitive behaviors often related to combat \nor escape. \nWhen a threat is identifIed by the person's hypothalamus, a \nprolong discharge of the locus ceruleus activates the nsympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. This \nactivation is associated with specifIc physiological actions \nin the system, both directly and indirectly through the \nrelease of epinephrine adrenaline triggered by acetylcholine released from \npreganglionic sympathetic nerves. \nton 110 \nFigure 14. The Locations of the Hypothalamus and \nThalamus in the Human Brain. \nThe other major player in the acute FOFR is the nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. When the threat is not \nremoved, the FOFR response continues to be active \nreleasing aggressive chemicals into the blood stream for \nlong durations. These chemicals are cancer causing and \ndisease causing to the body when exposed to for long \ndurations. \nThe Locus ceruleus \(Latin for the blue spot panic. The locus ceruleus is studied in \nrelation to clinical depression, panic disorder and anxiety. \nSome antidepressant medications including Reboxetine, \nVenlafaxine and Bupropion as well as ADHD medication nAtomoxetine are believed to act on neurons in this area. \nThis area of the brain is also intimately involved in REM \nsleep [14] Psychological illnesses are in response to a \nchemical imbalance caused by the long-term exposure to the \nchemicals released by the body as part of the FOFR \nchemicals used to protect ourselves on the thalamus and \nhypothalamus. \nFigure 15.

Illnesses \n• Suffer from Many Allergies \nThe following are the negative effects on a body from \nhaving cortisol present for too long: \n• Impaired cognitive performance \n• Suppressed thyroid function \n• Blood sugar imbalances such as hyperglycemia \n• Decreased bone density \n• Decrease in muscle tissue \n• Higher blood pressure \n• Lowered inununity and inflammatory responses in the \nbody, slowed wound healing, and other health nconsequences \n• Increased abdominal fat, which is associated with a \ngreater amount of health problems than fat deposited in \nother areas of the body. \n• Heart attacks \n• Strokes \n• The development of metabolic syndrome, higher levels \nof "bad" cholesterol \(LDL HDL lead to death. \nVIII. DEPRESSION \nDepression occurs when a person ignores the many \nmessages from the FOFR for a prolong time and the \nbrains thalamus/hypothalamus area releases chemicals \nat levels different than it would if the person was \nresponding properly to the FOFR. Depression is the \nfirst of many survival mechanisms the brain's pseudo \nconsciousness resorts to as it is forced to continuously \nwork to communicate with the conscious using limited \ncommunications methods that are often ignored by the \nconscious. It is all too common for people to become \ninsensitive to their feelings and emotions as a survival \nmechanism. \nFigure 20. The Balanced Lifestyle Necessary for \nTreating and Curing Mental Illness Includes making the \nChanges for Creating and Living a Balanced Lifestyle. \nAgain, depression is the fIrst attempt by the \nhypothalamus/subconscious portion of the brain to \ncommunicate with our conscious mind and inform us \nthat the conscious mind is ignoring the messages from \nour FOFR. These messages include hunches, feelings \nand emotions. These messages can number in the \nhundreds and range from the obvious to the subtle. \nThe time it takes the subconscious its messages are \nbeing ignored is in the years, before the symptoms \nfrom depression become serious enough to seek \nmedical treatment. Feelings often can ignored include \nanger, fear, love, happiness, sadness, guilt shame, \nloneliness. Emotions include pride, jealousy, anxiety, \nresentment, envy, frustration, joy, regret nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, \nsymptoms of depression include the following: \n Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, and \nmaking decisions \n• Fatigue and decreased energy \n Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, and/or helplessness \n• Feelings of hopelessness and/or pessimism \n Insomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or excessive \nsleeping \n• Irritability, restlessness \n• Loss of interest in activities or hobbies once \npleasurable, including physical intimacy \n• Overeating or appetite loss \n Persistent aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or \ndigestive problems that do not ease even with treatment \n Persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" feelings \n• Thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts \nThe following information is included in the rehabilitation \nprogram for treating and curing depression based on the \nFOFR being the cause of mental illness: \na the symptoms \n• Talk therapy to improve awareness of and reconnect \nwith feelings and emotions \nb depression: Ignoring messages from the \nsubconscious including hunches, feelings, emotions and \nother messages which causes the brain to change the brains \nchemistry causes many unpredictable behavior conditions. \nc Duration of time to acquire depression: Several years \nd Cure: Rehabilitation: Removal from existing lifestyle for \nat least 3 years. Changes to lifestyle that eliminates the \nthreats that the hypothalamus/thalamus determines to be a \nthreat \nt Good \ng depression prior to arrival in space: \n• Insensitivity to feelings and emotions \n• Unawareness for what feelings and emotions are for \n• The unawareness that the subconscious uses feeling, \nemotions, thoughts and hunches to communicate with \nthe conscious mind. \nIX. ANXIETY \nAnxiety is a serious medical illness, which affects a large \nnumber of people. It occurs often and is related to the \nmodern lifestyle that requires people to be exposed \ncontinuously to threatening people, places and activities \nsimultaneously on a long term, continuous basis. Anxiety is \none of many messages from the subconscious mind to the \nconscious mind that people describe as experiencing a \nfeeing or an emotion. Anxiety may be accompanied with \nfeelings or beliefs that their life is in immediate danger, out­\nof-control or are helpless or powerless to make changes in a \nsituation. \nAs a survival mechanism by the subconscious, anxiety \ndisorders are a result of the subconscious' independent \ndetermination that immediate danger or death exists from \npeople, places and activities simultaneously that greatly \nthreatens the person's life and the person has ignored other \nmessages with the same information in the past regularly. \nThe subconscious mind wants the conscious mind to know \nthat danger and the potential for death has been identified by \nthe subconscious. The subconscious does this by causing \nanxiety to be experienced by a person and wanting the \nperson to take action and run away from the danger. \nUnfortunately, it is extremely difficult for people to take the \nright action. \nThere are several recognized types of anxiety disorders \nincluding panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder \n\(COD post-traumatic stress disorder \(PTSD 


ndisorder . \nThe following information is based on the FOFR as the \ncause and cure of anxiety disorders: \na Common treatments of the symptoms: \n• Pharmacology for symptoms \n• Talk therapy to become aware of and reconnect \nwith feelings and emotions from the subconscious.3 \nb emotions and \nother messages from FOFRlhypothalamus and subconscious \ncausing chemical brain imbalance and unpredictable \nbehavior changes. \nc recover from depression: Twice the duration \nto acquire it. \ne lifestyle for \nat least 3 years. Changes to lifestyle that eliminates the \nthreats that the hypothalamus/thalamus determines to be a \nthreat \nt nimproving the long-term relationship between the \nsubconscious and conscious mind and understanding how \nthey communicate. \ng thalamus/hypothalamus to \nits pre-damaged condition, must rely on the natural healing \nby the body. \nh Required work to recover: High. The many years of \ndamage to the thalamus and hypothalamus because of nexposure to the harmful chemicals released by the FOFR \nrequires some changes in lifestyle that are often severe for \nmost people to make. Thus, most people will live with \nanxiety and use the medications to relieve relief from the \nsymptoms rather than adopt the right lifestyle their FOFR \ndemands to stop the progression of the mental illness to \neven more severe behavior changes including suicide. \nX. THE SENSORY INPUT TO THE FOFR nThe sources of the known sensory inputs into the fight-or­\nfight response/thalamus are the ears \(sound light pressure/pain odor temperature, \npressure equivalent to a \nchannel of analog information. This means that if the \nanalog input data were converted to digital telemetry, the \nFOFRlthalamus is receiving about 1 00 GB/S of input data \nfrom each channel of information continuously during \nwaking hours. \nThe sensory input to the subconscious and conscious is far nless during sleep and so data processing decreases allowing \nthe brain to slow down and recover from the day's work \nduring sleep. The FOFR and thalamus and hypothalamus \narea of the brain continues to monitor all the data inputs for \nthreats and remains ready to initiate any action necessary for \nself-preservation. \n12 nXI. THE COMMUNICATIONS BANDWIDTH \nBETWEEN THE SUBCONSCIOUS AND THE \nCONSCIOUS \nUsing feelings, hunches and emotions to communicate from \nthe subconscious to the conscious mind, the information \ninput to the conscious mind from the subconscious mind is \nsignificantly less than the sensory input into the FOFR \nsubsystem. The conscious mind would be easily overloaded \nif it received all the information that the FOFR subsystem nreceived from a person's eyes, ears, nervous system and \nskin and nose. \nThe communications capability between the conscious and \nsubconscious mind is close to zero and this is the reason that \nthe external sensory inputs such as ears, eyes and nose, to \nthe subconscious mind must be used to communicate with \nthe subconscious mind by the conscious mind even though \nboth reside in the same brain. It is confusing to understand \nthat the conscious thoughts are not accessible to the \nsubconscious mind, but they are not. Data exists that the \ncommunications between the subconscious and conscious \nmind is one way thus forcing the conscious mind to use the \nsame communication channels that are used by the \nsubconscious for receiving all other information. \nXII. How PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS PROCESS \nINFORMATION FOR PREDICTING MENTAL ILLNESS \nFigure 21 is the prognostic analysis that was completed on \nthree NASA EUVE satellite rate-gyros used for attitude ncontrol, pointing and reorienting of the NASA Extreme \nUltra-Violet Explorer \(EUVE orbiting \nspace science satellite. The behavior in the data in Figure 2 1  \nfor Gyro B was missed by the engineering analysis that was \ncompleted by the gyro vendor's manufacturing engineers. \nThe duration of time that the equipment telemetry spanned \nin the prognostic analysis in Figure 2 1  is equivalent to that \nof a prelaunch readiness, launch and 30  days of on-orbit \nhistory for a human space flight program. The prognostic nanalysis used the NASA EUVE gyro motor current. All \nthree rate-gyros were operating simultaneously for nredundancy purposes, only two gyros were needed \nfunctionally. The NRTE \(accelerated aging nGyro B telemetry motor current was processed using \nproprietary predictive algorithms. [ 16] \nPredictive algorithms demodulate telemetry behavior from \nthe measurements in time, amplitude, frequency and phase. \nThe demodulation process illustrates the presence of non­\nrepeatable changes that are usually overlooked and nmisdiagnosed as systemic noise from completely normal \nappearing and normal behaving people or systems nFigure 2 1 .

The three NASA Hubble Rate Gyros from \nFigure 21 where Gyro B Telemetry Included the nPresence of Accelerated Aging. \n1 3  \nXIII. WHAT IS A THREAT, STRESS, STRESSORS \nAND TRIGGERS \nThese terms need to be defined because they often used \nincorrectly. A threat to the FOFRIhypothalamus/thalamus is ndefined only by the a person's thalamus/hypothalamus and \nis believed to include such events as a dangerous animal \nready to strike, a person attempting to strike someone, a \nperson with a gun that may fire the gun to cause harm. \nStress is the response of the body when the FOFR is \nactivated when the thalamus/hypothalamus recognizes that a \nthreat as defined by the FOFR is present. Early indicators \nthat the FOFR has been activated include: hay \nfever/allergies, canker sores in and around the mouth and \ntongue, chapped lips heartburn, hemorrhoids \(inflamed \nrectum fellow employees, a bully at school, a failing grade \non a test, an angry fried, deadlines, homework, tests nmidterms and finals. \nTriggers are events, places, people, behavior or items that \nevoke a psychological behavior or reaction. Triggers are \nunique and identified only by a person's \nFOFRIthalamus/hypothalamus as a threat. The body \nresponds with a faster heartbeat, faster breathing, \nperspiration and increased blood pressure as well as \npsychological and/or emotional responses. \nXIV.

The Different Rates of Degradation for the \nBrains Subsystems caused by the Chemicals Released by \nthe FOFR Eventually Resulting in Mental Illness. \nThis different rate of degradation for the brain's subsystems \n\(see Figure 23 released by the FOFR long-term is the basis for \nthe application and usability of the prognostic and health nmanagement program to predict and prevent mental illness. \nAs the brain's subsystems degrade in perfonnance their \nfunctionality changes and this change in functionality is \nillustrated in telemetry, using predictive algorithms in a \nPHM \(see Figure 2 1 detennining if an offset \nor non-repeatable transient event \(a.k.a. accelerated aging personnel on board space exploration missions \nby comparing a person's baseline circadian and ultradian nrhythms behavior and real-time circadian and ultradian \nrhythms. If either or both exists, it means that the nFOFRIthalamus is degraded by the harsh chemicals of the \nFOFR and the thalamus will continue to degrade in nperformance enough to cause mental illness in the near \nfuture. \nPredictive algorithms require information from the inside of \nthe active part of a system. Fortunately, the part of the brain \nthat controls circadian rhythms resides next to the thalamus \nand hypothalamus and the behavior that is controlled by the \ncircadian rhythm proved the information to be processed \nusing predictive algorithms. So when the thalamus and nhypothalamus are damaged from the harsh chemicals from \nthe FOFR, the part of the brain that controls the circadian \nrhythms is also damaged due to its location near the \nthalamus and hypothalamus \(see Figure 25 the damage \nis identifiable by using predictive algorithms to process the \n14  \nmeasurements from the body that experience circadian \nrhythm. \nFigure 25. The Location in the Brain where Circadian \nand Ultranian Rhythms Originate Near the Thalamus \nand Hypothalamus that Create the FOFR that are \nDamaged from Long Term Exposure to Cortisol and \nAdrenaline. \n[191Almost every function in the human body exhibits a \ncircadian rhythm and major changes to these rhythms can be \nused to predict mental illness. In ambulatory conditions nenvironmental factors and physical exertion can obscure or \nenhance the expressed rhythms. The three most commonly \nmonitored vital signs are blood pressure \(systolic and \ndiastolic Because these \nvariables exhibit daily rhythms, their normal values vary \nwith the time of day. \nTable 3 shows the normative ranges for these variables. \nCircadian rhythms are produced by natural factors within \nthe body 


but they are also affected by signals from the \nenvironment. Light is the main cue that triggers circadian nrhythms, and turning light on or turning light off trigger the \ngenes that control an organism's internal clocks. Circadian \nrhythms are physical, mental and behavioral changes that \nfollow an approximate 24-hour cycle, responding primarily \nto the light and darkness in a person's immediate \nenvironment. They are found in people, most living things, \nincluding animals, plants and many tiny microbes. \nCircadian rhythms change sleep-wake cycles, hormone \nrelease, body temperature and other important bodily \nfunctions. Researchers have already identified the genes that \ndirect circadian rhythms in people, fruit flies, mice, fungi \nand several other model organisms. \nCircadian rhythms determine many human behavioral \npatterns.[201 The body's master clock controls the production \nof melatonin, a honnone for sleep. The area of the brain that \ncreates circadian rhythms is located just above the optic \nnerves, which relay infonnation about the incoming light to nthe eyes. When there is less light-like at night-the area \ntells the brain to make more melatonin so a person gets \ndrowsy. Ultradian rhythms are events in the body that are \nrepeated throughout a 24-hour circadian day In contrast, \ninfradian rhythms, are events such as the human menstrual \ncycle, have period longer than a day nTable 3.

A continuum exists from the \nmolecular genetics, through the cellular and neuroendocrine \nto the behavioral and psychosocial levels. The ultradian \nrhythms have far-reaching consequences for our \nunderstanding of human physiological and mental health \nand disease. Some ultradian cycling of the body include \nhormonal release, heart rate, thermoregulation, urination, \nbowel activity nostril dilation and appetite. The last \ninvolves rhythmic release of Neuropeptide Y \(NPY nCorticotropin-releasing hormone \(CRR by recognizing the presence \nof changes to the circadian rhythms that are caused by the \nlack of the following items in a person's  life. Mental illness \ncan be cured by having the same factors prominent in a \nperson's life. The healing of the brain can be increased by \nthinking of the brain as a part of the physical body.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
