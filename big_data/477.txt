O VERALL S YSTEM D ESIGN  Usually, electromagnetic data acquisition system is used in the wild, so the technical requirements for equipment are low power consumption, small size, large amount of data storage, high precision, multi-machine synchronization acquisition. The energy of signal accepted by electromagnetic sensor is very weak, and the amplitude is very small. Its magnitude is generally 002\035 V ~ mV, so the signal is easily disturbed by noise. Based on the above factors, this paper proposes the following design, and the hardware includes the analog signal conditioning circuit and data acquisition circuit. The single acquisition block is shown in Figure.1  
   
Figure. 1 Single acquisition block  Since the signal that front-end sensor outputs is differential signal, the pre-amplifier function converts differential signal into single-ended signal, and provides the variable gain with high CMRR for entire system. The role of the main amplifier is giving variable gain so that the range of signal passes through the main amplifier is in the dynamic range of ADC. In order to achieve programmable gain control, the pre-amplifier and main amplifier are designed by means of the programmable gain instrumentation amplifier In the outdoor environment, the interference of 50Hz is inevitable, which is a serious impact on the accuracy of the system. When the power frequency interference signal exceeds a lot by contrast with measured signal, the interference signal will dominate the amplifier gain, so that

the amplifier can not effectively amplify measured signal In order to exclude the power frequency interference signal the notch filters of the 50Hz, 150Hz and 250Hz are designed. The high-pass filter is needed too, which suppresses 1/f noise Using the analog switch achieves the option of the notch filter and the high pass filter access to circuit Based on 16-bit digital-to-analog converter, the DAC circuit is designed, which can achieve the self-test function of the system In the data acquisition circuit, 24-bit 002\010 001 ADC AD7763, FPGA and ARM9 constitute a high-resolution A/D measurement system. The AD7763 combines wide input bandwidth and high speed with the benefits of 002\010 001  conversion, as well as performance of 107 dB SNR at 625kSPS. An integrated buffer to drive the reference, a differential ampli-fier for signal buffering and level shifting, an overrange flag, internal gain and offset registers, and a low-pass, digital FIR filter make the AD7763 a compact, highly integrated data acquisition device requiring minimal peripheral component selection w h ic h can e ffectiv el y redu ce t h e s i ze of system. The AD7763 also provides synchronization function, four AD7763 devices can be used to perform synchronized measurement, and the synchronous clock is from the GPS Field-Programmable Gate Array is an interface converter between SPI interface of the AD7763 and parallel interface of the ARM9, the ARM9 sets user-programmable registers and read conversion results through FPGA Because the speeds of ARM9 and FPGA do not match, the data will be collected in the internal FIFO in temporary to ensure data is not lost, and the ARM9 read data from FIFO store in the SD card. The ARM9 processor S3C2440 is used as the embedded Linux operating system transplantation platform, which has many excellences that are unmatchable for industrial personal computer \(IPC\ in power consumption and size  and greatly facilitates the application development and follow-up system upgrade The operating system controls the data acquisition and uploads conversion results via Ethernet interface III  S YSTEM S OFTWARE D ESIGN  Since this system is involved in the FPGA and embedded Linux operating system, so the software includes FPGA software and data acquisition software under Linux operating system A  FPGA Software Design Based on the top-down design method and VHDL language, FPGA software includes mainly the control program of the AD7763 and the LTC1650, and the followings are the detailed analysis of the control program of the AD7763 1  Reading Data form the AD7763 In the first, CDIV pin of the AD7763 stays logic low and SCR pin stays logic high continuously. When the AD7763 complete a conversion process every time, the conversion result output on the SDO line is framed by the frame synchronization output, FSO, which is sent logic low for 32 SCO cycles following the rising edge of the signal DR h e  FPGA can read each bit of the new conversion result on the falling SCO edge  According to the reading timing diagram in the datasheet, the top-level reading operation procedure is designed, as shown in Figure 2. Firstly, the ARM9 must control rdreq pin to make FPGA generate a reading enable signal. Secondly, the ARM9 controls MUX32_16_SEL pin and then reads 31-bit actual data. So completing an integrated reading process only needs rdreq pin and MUX32_16_SEL. The followings are the analysis of each functional module  READ FIFO MUX32_16 RESET_GEN RESET DATAOUT_SIR MUX32_16_SEL SDO FSO SCO RESET_CON 16-bit data DRDY FIFO write and read enable rdreq Figure. 2 The reading operation top-level diagram  a  RESET_GEN This module generates a signal of resetting AD7763 under the control of RESET_CON pin which must take RESET pin low for a minimum of 1 MCLK cycle  b\ READ It is a 32-bit serial-parallel converter, in which SDO, SCO, FSO, DRDY, SDL line are respectively connected with corresponding pins of the AD7763. This module makes the input 32-bit serial data on SDO line converted into a 32-bit parallel data when FSO pin is in the state of logic low  c\ FIFO writing and reading enable This module is make up of two D flip-flops, a NOT gate, a AND gate Writing enable module outputs a write enable pulse that is taken for a SCO cycle under the control of the signal DATAOUT_SIR from READ module, to make FIFO module store a new conversion data. Reading enable module outputs a SCO cycle width read allow pulse under the control of rdreq pin, thereby, and then the system can accomplish an operation of reading data from FIFO  d\ FIFO The 32-bit, 2k depth FIFO is build by the pm-fifo module, which is used to store A/D conversion result in the temporary. The lpm-fifo module is inner in the Quartus software  e  MUX32_16 Under the control of the signal MUX32_16_SEL, the MUX32_16 module delivers 32-bit data from the FIFO to the ARM9 in twice \(16 bits each time  The simulation result of reading operation timing is shown in Figure.3. It can be seen that the simulation timing is the same as timing in the datasheet, which meet the design requirement

 Figure. 3 Reading timing simulation   2  Writing to the AD7763 When the system writes a command to the AD7763, a signal FSI is needed, which informs the AD7763 that a writing operation is coming, and then 32-bit command word is written to the registers in the AD7763 on the SCO falling edge. The first 16 bits select the device and register address for which the data written is intended. The second 16 bits contain the data for the selected register. Obviously, in the FPGA, the control software is easy to achieve  According to the writing timing diagram in the datasheet, the writing operation top-level procedure is designed and shown in Figure.4. Firstly, the ARM9 must control MUX16_32_SEL pin and deliver 32 bits word to the FPGA   in twice \(16 bits each time\dly, the ARM9 controls WRITE_CON pin to initiate a writing operation. The followings are the analysis of each functional module  Figure. 4 The top-level writing operation diagram  a\ WRITE It is a 32-bit parallel-serial converter, which loads 32-bit data that MUX16_32 module outputs when signal LOAD is taken logic low, furthermore, writes 32-bit serial data to the AD7763 during taking LOAD  signal logic high  b\ WRITE_CON It is responsible for generating the signal two control signals under the control of pin WRITE_CON. One is signal FSI, which start writing userprogrammable registers operation, another is signal LOAD which control the loading and transmitting data of WRITE module c  MUX16_32  Under the control of the signal MUX16_32_SEL, the MUX16_32 module transforms two 16-bit words that the ARM9 outputs into 32-bit, and then deliver 32-bit word to the WRITE module The simulation result of writing operation timing is shown in Figure.5. It can be seen that the simulation timing is the same as timing in the datasheet, which meet the design requirement   Figure. 5   Writing timing simulation   B  Embedded Software In order to achieve modular software design under Linux operating system, the software is divided into three layers: GPIO driver, control function under Linux, QT interface program, and the relationship of program call is shown in Figure.6   Figure. 6 The relationship of program call under Linux  GPIO driver is responsible for interface conversion between FPGA and ARM9. Control functions under Linux control hardware devices by calling the functions in GPIO driver. Through making use of bottom C program, QT interface program achieve mainly human-machine interface operation. So the 3-layer software is called layer by layer   1  GPIO Driver Generally, in embedded Linux operating system, device driver is divided into three categories: character device, block device, network interface. Because output ports of the GPIO are directly connected with FPGA, the system adopts character device driver. The driver mainly achieves system calling of some functions, such as open  e    rite \(\d ioctl  d so on  a  Open In the device driver, open  sed to initialize device, which is prepare for the equipment operation. Its main task is to confirm whether the hardware is in a state of readiness, verify the legitimacy of minor device number, control the number of equipment processes return status code according to the function implementation\(0 indicates success, a negative number indicates there is an error b\ Read   In the device driver, read  to read data from the device. For include/asm-arm /arch-s3c2440 regs-gpio.h already complete the hardware port mapping in Linux kernel, this function mainly call kernel function named __raw_readl  n order to sent data from GPIO port c\  Write In the device driver, write  charge of to write data to the hardware device.

firstly, and then write data to GPIO port through kernel function __raw_writel   d\ Ioctl In the device driver, ioctl  responsible for reading data directly or set the state of GPIO port, yet in the interface driver, ioctl  ainly call s3c2410_gpio_setpin and s3c2410_gpio_getpin\(\n the /arch/arm  mach-s3c2410 gpio.c in order to set and read the status value of single GPIO port 2  Control Function in Linux In order to achieve modular programming, control program of each hardware device is needed, which is written by C language, and is compiled into an executable f  T h e con t rol prog ram  could set user-programmable registers of the AD7763 through   ioctl 001 read 002 write\(\  the  interface driver and read data from the AD7763 through ioctl 001 read  3  QT Interface Program QT is a cross-platform C graphical user interface library, which is produced by the TrollTech in Norwegian, and provides all the tools that are necessary for the development of user interface application It primarily achieves this function in the form of the collecting of C++ classes [8  Because QT is based on C++, but Linux is based on C, mixed programming with C++ and C is needed  Here, the interface program is divided into two parts setting interface and data acquisition interface, so two C classes are needed. The operating system start and display interface by menu calling. In each interface, the system call control compiled program making use of the fork   and exec  d then sent parameters to control program, so that the operating system completes setting the registers and reading data from the AD7763. The data acquisition interface is showed in Figure  7   IV  C ONCLUSION  This paper has discussed hardware and software design of the electromagnetic data acquisition system, based on 24bit 002\010 001 analog to digital converter AD7763, field programmable gate array, ARM9 processor S3C2440 and embedded Linux operating system.

Virtual Web Service framework pre-conditions and post-condition parameters of service to calculate the similarities between the requester service and the provider service, then make sorting based on Similarity Function Matching algorithm. According to the knowledge and rules base, VWS sorts the provider services by the similarity VWS also provides a unified interface above the VWS server. Therefore, requesters do not have to concern the service address and the transfer protocol, and do not have to do any changes in case the service provider changes, since the VWS will re-adopt another service which is most similar to the requester service All of these VWS mechanisms shall overcome the problems mentioned above C.

To support this effort the OCFO created a series of measures 1 costing pattern for each funded project in 2008. This gave the resource analysts a baseline to work against 2  exception reports  These reports were used by the OCFO and the Mission Directorates to review the initial plan submissions. The exception reports highlighted any deltas between the 2008 spending pattern and the 2009 plans. In addition the reports also flagged any other errors and rule violations 3 to assist program offices and Centers in estimating the lead times for various types of procurements The second area of improvement was the communication between the functional organizations \(Centers product organizations \(Mission Directorates ownership of the final approved agency phasing plans. A highly interactive process with weekly teleconferences and three video-conferences, supported by enhanced phasing plan tools, was implemented to further open the missioncenter communication during the phasing plan development, review, and approval cycles 6 Finally, commitments \(see footnote 3  in addition to obligations and cost  were added to the set of performance indicators. Since the budget execution process starts with committing funds, the level of commitments could serve as an early warning indicator for obligations. In practice, the actual commitments of 2009 were compared to the historic spending pattern of 2008 6. DISCUSSION How many large-scale projects were canceled before their implementation even started? Project managers are only too familiar with the traditional model, which starts off with an extensive process of requirements collection. After years of producing large documents, the political situation has changed, the key executives have moved on and the project gets  re-scoped   If there was only one lesson learned for the development of management systems, then it is: define a clear goal and keep the requirements collection process as short as possible Start with the  low-hanging fruit  and use what is at hand and has proven its usefulness \(bricolage None of the other enablers was particularly new. However it was the consequent pursuit of a fast and results-oriented implementation that guided project management \(executive sponsor vs. expert facilitator stakeholder involvement, and a flexible software engineering approach \(agile programming Finally, a sustainable success can only be accomplished if the system actually gets used in  every-day  management decisions. In this case, the ABED became the single source of reference for a wide range of budget execution decisions within NASA REFERENCES 1] A.

the evaluation of the designed methodology according to the design research paradigm  4. Evaluation of RPBBs  The evaluation described in this paper focuses on RPBBs which are the results of applying the methodology \(not the designed artifact itself Findings about quality and applicability of RPBBs allow conclusions regarding the quality and applicability of the underlying methodology. In this contribution, a formal and a contentual evaluation are differentiated. While the formal part contains theoretical analyses of RPBBs regarding predefined requirements \(cp. Section 3.1 documents the practical \(content-related applicability of RPBBs  4.1. Formal Evaluation  As part of the research project, twelve workshops and several interviews in European municipalities have been conducted which involved domain experts and modeling specialists who had to benchmark each RPBB with regards to fulfillment of the defined design goals \(cp. section 3.1 completely fulfilled, +/- partially fulfilled, - not fulfilled  not evaluated yet municipalities provided process models that were used to identify process activities and to design the RPBB. However they were not involved in the design process thus ensuring validity of the evaluation results through separation of data used to develop the method from evaluation data. As already mentioned in Section 3.1, the requirement of a minimal number Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 of RPBBs is replaced by relevancy/necessity. If all RPBBs are considered relevant and necessary, the number of RPBBs can be assumed minimal. Three RPBBs have not been evaluated, as they have just been identified during the prior evaluation period Table 6 provides an overview of the results  Table 6: Evaluation of RPBBs Requirements No. of evaluated RPBBs    Modularity 24 10 0 3 Reusability 33 1 0 3 Comprehensibility 31 3 0 3 Unambiguity 20 14 0 3 Documentation 33 1 0 3 Relevancy/Necessity 27 7 0 3 Multilingualism 34 0 0 3 Level of Generality 33 1 0 3 Level of Detail 22 12 0 3  Altogether, the degree of accomplishment can be considered as high. There is no RPBB that does not meet the demands. However, deficiencies can be identified regarding modularity, unambiguity and level of detail. Examples for deficits concerning the level of detail are the RPBBs ?send? and ?archive Especially archiving can be understood as a modular activity or separate process fragment. Weaknesses regarding modularity and unambiguity are closely related to the demand that only minimal overlapping should occur. Although overlapping could not be prevented completely, the evaluators? feedback initiated extensive revisions on names, synonyms examples and explanations of RPBBs. A list of the most deficient RPBBs is presented in Table 7. These 


most deficient RPBBs is presented in Table 7. These RPBBs have to be carefully analyzed during further modeling activities in order to be improved or rejected  Table 7: List of most deficient RPBBs RPBB No. of Deficiencies Coordinate 10 Assign 3 Take from 3 Change/Update/Complete 3  Summarizing, suitability of RPBBs for distributed modeling of collaborative processes can be confirmed on the basis of the formal evaluation However, evaluation from a content-based perspective provides more experience-driven and thus, practice-related feedback 4.2. Contentual Evaluation  For contentual, practice-oriented evaluation, a number of 200 processes have been modeled with five municipalities that are involved in the project to prove practical applicability. Using a prototypical web-based tool implementation, the modeling was carried out in a distributed manner by public administration officials. The procedure for distributed collaborative modeling required each official to depict the present status of their process fragments as well as the information flow with other process participants \(whom themselves modeled their activities points out the basic principle of differentiating RPBBs and information objects is presented in Figure 3 using the Business Process Modeling Notation [30 This fragment depicts the involvement of another collaborating unit within a municipal approval process which the building authority is basically responsible for. This unit participates in the service production by providing a statement. Although specific attributes have been annotated for RPBBs and information objects, they are not visible in the presented view. Examples are the number of pages and medium of information objects as well as communication channel, number of copies, and template support \(cp. Table 5 Documenting 200 real processes of diverse public administrations proved to be very valuable because both, the various issues as well as the perceived advantages of the component-based modeling approach emerged. Most important advantages mentioned by evaluators from public administrations are the standardization and flexibility of process modeling \(consistent levels of detail and generality as well as terminological pre-definitions specifications that enable modeling also for inexperienced people, and the transparent modeling approach \(combination of RPBBs and information objects methodology meets the basic requirements for distributed modeling of collaborative processes discussed in Section 2.1 Perceived issues to be addressed are a lack of awareness about some self-evident activities uncertainties regarding overlapping \(which should have been eliminated to a large extent level of detail which causes relatively high modeling efforts. Issues and advantages have to be considered by further research as the discussed findings only represent perception in the public sector domain  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009

This contribution describes both the construction as well as the evaluation of the methodology in the public sector where the identified RPBBs have been used exemplarily for modeling of about 200 municipal processes Summarizing, the RPBB-based modeling is considered to be suitable to model collaborative processes in a distributed way. A number of advantages can be exploited from the described component based modeling approach such as the reduction of model heterogeneity and the diffusion of a common understanding \(through standardization of terminology, level of detail and level of abstraction the distributed modeling of process fragments by responsible domain experts as well as the consistent consolidation of the process fragments to complete process models based on their standardized components The actual methodology for RPBB identification provides a valuable basis for targeted users \(cp Section 1 individual domains and purposes. Although this contribution is limited to an analysis of the suitability for the public sector domain, the specified RPBBs can be evaluated for the use in other industries that focus on information management and collaborative service production \(e.g. finance or insurance sectors as well However, the claimed generality of the actual methodology for domain-independent identification of RPBBs has not been proven yet. For that purpose current research is concentrating on applying the methodology to other industries. Due to the collaborative character of medical treatment processes and the highly specialized and distributed knowledge of involved actors, the health care domain was selected for a follow-up project. The expected findings will provide valuable information to improve the methodology described in this paper Further challenges and potential fields for research arose during the evaluation. First, guidance rules should be developed in order to implement capable plausibility and consistency checks not only from a syntactic but especially from a semantic point of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 view [31]. Additional evaluation of the methodology itself \(which is the actual artifact by using the methodology in other domains, in order to refine and complete the design activities. A potential disadvantage identified during evaluation is related to the high level of detail which has to be managed. Although the provided methodology is 


managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
