About 62.5% ASes are assigned more than 10  000 prefixes Even worse more than 11.6 of ASes own more than 1,000,000 prefixes and more than 85% of these ASes are stub ASes  Firstly h ow to manage so many prefixes and assign them to hosts and routers for ASe s is still an open issue  Secondly routers and ho sts may own a mass of addresses  which could result in s ome problems  such as  source and  destination address selection  egress router select ion and session survivability  Thirdly  it could cause knotty problems for  mapping system e.g Domain Name System DNS    S ince one name may be mapped to numerous addresse s t oo many addresses may stress DNS by increasing memory requirements delay ing  name resolution and con suming  more network capacity  For instance if a host has 1 0  00 0 IPv6 addresses it may need 1 0  00 0  AAAA resource records \(RR s in DNS which could cost at least 20 0 M memory in DNS, because one RR on ly records one IPv6 address 10    Moreover, since there is a practical limit of 512 bytes for DNS replies [11    o n e  DNS  r es o lu t i o n  m ay  in clu d e  4 0 0  DNS replies which may delay name resolution  and  consume at leas t 2 0 0M of network capacity approximately In addition a lthough HA  s global deployment solve s  the scalability of Default Free Zone   DFZ  it may  enlarge  some  ASes   routing table s For example  certain A S has ten customers or peers each of which  own s  10  00 0  prefixes This AS has to maintain at least 10 0 000 routing entries. It may be a challenge for smaller ISPs, which is shown and discussed in the following evaluation result   en-US Internet AS level topology could be  modeled as a hierarchical graph. We believe  th at the lower position  e.g. the leaf nodes HA deploy with  the less prefixes ASes may be assigned Although it is proved the mathematic derivation is not shown in this paper for lack of space. It is also verified in our evaluation results  Thus to addre ss the excessive prefix problem HA could be deployed starting with a lower level  But does this solution  have any adverse effect on the scalability of Internet routing system? If it does, is there a better deployment way to solve both the excessive prefi x problem and the routing scalability issue  These questions are addressed in this paper Besides the hierarchical  way some non topology based addressing and routing mechanisms [12 14   ar e a ls o  p r o p o s e d  recently  Quantifying the impact of different HA dep loyment

en-US ways on the prefix assignment  and the routing scalability   may answer some considerations  in designing addressing and routing architecture  for future Internet   en-US The main contributions of this paper include the following folds   en-US 1  We define the model of  prefix assignment and routing advertisement in different HA deployment methods and the calculation of the prefix amount and routing table size that arbitrary AS owns  en-US 2  We simulate the processes of prefix assignment and routing advertisement under scenarios  of different deployment ways based on the real Internet AS level topology  en-US 3  Moreover we also measure the actual distribution s  of prefix amount and routing table size in today  s Internet  en-US 4  Comparing with the actual Internet  s data, we analyze the impact of d ifferent deployment ways on the prefix amounts and routing table sizes and find suitable ways to deploy HA  en-US II  R ELATED WORKS  en-US HA is originated from John M  s research  15   The prefix aggregation enables contiguous IP addresses or prefixes to be aggr egated into one prefix. This could reduce the routing cost on both data plane \(e.g. the routing table size\ and control plane e.g BGP updates However the loss is the possible increase of the average path length for the message traffic 16   Leonard Kl einrock and Farouk Kamoun are the first to evaluate performance of the HA for large networks 17   They focus ed  on the tradeoff between the routing table size and network path length  Yinfang Zhuang et al provided an indication of the efficiency of hierar chical addressing at the inter domain level in today  s Internet  18   en-US The excessive prefix problem  in HA has been already discussed. Yang Song et al. pointed out that it was possible that some ASes would inherit a large number of prefixes and all these p refixes would show up in their own routing tables and routing tables of other ASes who were peer with these ASes [7   In order to solve this problem, Bruno Quoitin et al. limited  the number of prefixes delegated to the customer domains  to 2 or 5 In additi on  they also pr oposed  another solution for the problem each  of the transit domains was  allocated a globally advertised prefix e.g provider independent  PI  prefix and non transit networks were  delegated  prefixes from their providers  8   en-US In Internet  the routing scalability issue is not new either From 1988 to April 1994 the routing table size grew at an exponential rate This crisis was come through by the introduction of Classless InterDomain Routing  CIDR   However, from late 1998, CIDR has been  unable to keep pace with the growth of the Internet and the routing table size shows the sign of exponential growth again 19 This challenge raises great research interest on the growth of BGP routing table  size 1 20 21  and the solutions to the scal ability problem of Internet routing 22 In addition, some research efforts aim to characterize how much improvement these proposals could achieve Dong Ping et al  evaluate d  the performance of the isolation of core networks from edge networks on the achi evement in the reduction of the global routing table size  23  Yangyang Wang et al quantif ied  the impact of different core edge separation positions on the routing scalability  24   As far as we are aware, ours is the first attempt to quantify the impac t of different HA deployment ways on ASes' prefixes and routing table sizes  seeking for the solution s  to both the routing scalability issue and the excessive prefix problem  en-US III  H IERARCHICAL A DDRESSING AND I NTER DOMAIN ROUTING IN I NTERNET  en-US  In this section hie rarchical addressing and inter domain routing are introduced briefly Nowadays, Internet is composed of transit ASes and stub ASes There are mainly three commercial contractual relationships between ASes including provider customer P2C or C2P relations hip peer peer relationship \(P2P\, and sibling sibling \(S2S\ relationship Since S 2 S  relationship is few and its inference is incomplete i t is ignored in our analysis 24   en-US  In the global deployment of HA the top tier ASes which compose the Internet core are assigned prefixes from Regional Internet Registries \(RIRs\. Then, they assign a fraction of each of their prefixes to their customer ASes These customers excepting the stub ASes assign their customers one sub prefix from each of those prefixes they inherit This process recurs ending with the stub ASes because  they have no customers However in the stub network deployment only stub ASes  inherit prefixes from their providers  while other transit ASes are allocated one or several PI prefixes  en-US  Becau se advertisement policies determine which address blocks appear in the routing table, it is necessary to introduce these rules [25   en-US   Exporting to a provider  an AS can advertise to its providers its routes and routes of its customers but usually not route s of its providers or peers  en-US   Exporting to a customer an AS can export its routes and routes of its customers as well as routes of its providers and peers  en-US   Exporting to a peer an AS can advertise to its peers its routes and routes of its customers, but u sually not routes of its providers or peers  en-US IV  C OMPUTING PREFIX AMOU NT AND ROUTING TABLE  SIZE  en-US  For  the excessive prefix problem we believe that  the deployment  of HA  starting with a lower position of Internet's topology may be the solution   However whether it has any adverse effect on the routing scalability is worried. T he impact of these HA deployment ways on AS  s prefix amount and routing table size is  analyzed in the following  en-US  Based on the provider customer relationship Internet AS level topology coul d be characterized as a hierarchical graph which is decomposed into several levels Different HA deployment ways in this paper refer to the deployment s  starting with different level s   However Internet AS level topology is not strictly hierarchical practic ally 26   T h e r e  a r e  c r o s s layer P2C AS relationships For better understanding of the

In  C i ASes locating above the i th  level advertise to their providers at the adjacent higher level and peers at the same level their owned prefixes and the prefixes advertised by their customers, since these customer prefixes are PI prefixes which could not be performed aggregation. On the other side, ASes at i th  level and the levels below  could aggregate their customers   prefixes before advertising them to neighbors since these prefixes are sub prefixes of the ASes The amount of the prefixes advertised to AS  s peers after aggregation equals to the amount of AS  s own prefixes We assume that each provider advertises only one default route to each of its customers In fact it is usually the option of most providers  Thus, each doma in should maintain several default routes, the amount of which equals to  the amount of  its providers Customer advertises to each of its providers only the correspondent prefixes that the provider allocates to it Thus the amount of each AS  s routing tabl e in different en-US s is  computed by \(2  en-US Note that the routing table si ze in  our analysis refers to the  en-US Routing Information Base   RIB   size which is transformed to Forwarding Information Base FIB   size in Section V  in order to compar e with the global FIB size in today  s Internet  en-US   2  en-US V  E VALUATION  en-US   prefix amount and routing table size in different C i s by evaluation In order to make a comparison  first we do a statistics about the distributions of prefix amount and routing table size in today  s Internet.

About 1.3% of ASes are a ssigned more than 100 prefixes Considering some ASes  de aggregate  their prefixes and advertise the se specific prefixes into routing do mains, we make a pretreatment in which we aggregate  the aggregatable prefixes advertised by the same AS before investigating the distribution of prefix amount.

en-US  en-US Fig. 1  The distribution of prefix amount in Internet  en-US Internet  s global routing table growth could be obtained from BGP report [2  shown that the global RIB size in Internet increases from 8,550,000 to 10,840,000 and the global FIB size has a growth from 191 500 to 351,585  within the five  years between  2006 and  2011   en-US B  Decompositon of Internet AS level Topology  en-US  W e make a fine granularity decomposition on Internet hierarchy to examine the impact of C i s  on prefix  amount and routing table size  The Internet hiera rchy is mostly determined by the C2P/P2C relationships. The prefix assignment in HA is along the P2C hierarchy and the route advertisements in customers are propagated along the C2P hierarchy to providers Thus, we decompose the Internet topolog y in terms  of the P2C hierarchy  The  isolated AS nodes and nodes which only have P2P ed ges are not included in this  AS graph Thus, it  is a sub graph of the complete Internet topology  First we infer AS relationships using the algorithm proposed by Lixin Gao 25  w ith the BGP  data  in  January 1 st  2011   The AS nodes and the AS relationships constitute an AS graph. Then, the algorithm in Algorithm I ranks  each AS along the P2C hie rarchy  It  begins with the top tier ASe s which have no providers.

The ASes  without  providers locate at the 0 th  level In this section the cross layer P2C relationships are included In  C i   the prefix  assignment is composed of two parts In t he first  part AS e s above the i th  level including ASes locating at the i th  level are  assigned one PI  prefix In t he second part  firstly the ASes above the i th  level assign a fraction of its prefix to the ASes below the  i th  level if they are P2C. Then, in the zone of i th   50 th  level s ASes at a higher level  assign a fraction of each of its  prefixes to ASes at each lower level when they have P2C relationships  This prefix assignment algorithm is shown in  Algorithm II The route advertisement in  C i  is also composed of two par ts the HA zone and the non HA zone HA zone  refers  to the  ASes  below the i th  level which are deployed HA  while the non HA zone  refers to the ASes above the i th  level. In  the HA zone the route adverti sement starts from the ASes at 50 th  level. Each AS at a lower level ad vertises to its providers at  each higher level \(including all the higher levels in non HA zone\ the corresponding  prefixes that they assign Each AS also advertise s  its peers at the same level its prefixes. This process ends with the ASes a t the i th  level In the non HA zone the route advertisement starts from the ASes at the i th  level and ends with the 0 th  level. Each AS at a lower level advertises its prefixes and the  prefixes  exported from  its customers  in the non_HA zone to its provider s at the each higher level The  AS also advertise s  its peers at the same level its prefixes and the  prefixes  exported from  its customers  in the non_HA zone  The algorithm is shown in Algorithm III   en-US T he evaluation result s of different C i  scenarios are shown  in Fig 2 and Fig 3   A ll of the simulations from C 0  to C 50  have been performed  The curves in the Fig 2  only present the distributions of prefixes in C 0   C 10   C 20   C 30  and C 40   en-US ALGORITHM II  PREFIX  A SSIGNMENT  IN C i  en-US Input: AS graph  en-US Output: distribution of ASes   prefix  amount  en-US Phase 1: prefix assignment above i th  level  en-US 1  h 0  en-US 2  H 50  en-US 3  For each AS h,q  at h th  level, 0 h  i  en-US 4   PR h,q  1  en-US 5   h   en-US 6  h 0  en-US 7  p=i 1   en-US 8  For each AS h,q  at h th  level, 0 h  i  en-US 9   For each AS p,j  at each p th  level i  p  H  en-US 10   I f AS p,j  is a customer of AS h,q  en-US 11    PR p,j   PR p,j   PR h,q   en-US 12   p   en-US 13   h  en-US Phase 2: prefix assignment below  i th  level  en-US 14  h  i   en-US 15  s  h 1  en-US 16  For each AS h,j  at each  h th  level i  h  H  en-US 17   F or each AS s,k  at s th  level h  s  H  en-US 18   I f AS h,j  is a provider of AS s,k  en-US 19   PR s,k   PR s,k    PR h,j   en-US 20   s   en-US 21   h   en-US

A point x  y in the curves of Fig 2 repr esents the percentage of ASes which own more than x  prefixes is y  It is shown that w hen i  gets bigger the prefix amount of arbitrary AS in different C i  is monotonically decreasing The max prefix amount in each C i  is AS35052  owning 36,862,164  prefixes in  C 0  AS35052  owning  807,344 prefixes in C 10  AS35052  owing  39,615 prefixes in C 20  AS24298  owning 7,057 prefixes in C 30  AS37062  owing 272 prefixes in C 40   en-US  en-US Fig. 2  The distribution of prefix amount in  C i  en-US The curves in the Fig. 3  presen t the distributions of routing table  size in C 0   C 10   C 20   C 30   C 40  and  C 50   A point x  y in the curves of Fig. 3 represents the percentage of ASes which own more than x  routing table entries is y  The RIB/FIB ratio on January 2011 is 30.8445   2  In ord er to compare with today  s Internet, the RIB size will be transformed into FIB size in the following. The maximum RIB size of ASes locating at the 0 th  level is defined as the global routing table Hence the transform of the global RIB size is defined as t he global FIB size The global FIB  size in C 0 C 50  increase s  progressively from  8 5  to 463,700,156  entrie s   Thus, we conclude that while i  of C i  is getting bigger the prefix amount of each AS is decreasing while the global FIB size is increasing From the m easurement result we find C 18  and C 1 9  could solve the excessive prefix problem and reduce the global FIB size. The global FIB size in C 18  is 112,280 which is only one third of t he actual Internet  s global FIB size with 351,610 on January 2011 2    Althou gh the max prefix amount in C 18  is 112,990 the number of ASes which are assigned more than 10,000 prefixes is very small. Comparing  with the distribution of prefix amount in today  s Internet we think the prefix distribution in C 18  is acceptable for today  s DNS and network operators  In addition  the prefix amount in C 1 9  is smaller than the one in C 1 8 but the global FIB size increases to about 200,000. Therefore, we can conclude that C 1 8 and C 1 9  are suitable HA deployment ways in which the excessive prefi x problem is avoided and the global FIB size could be reduced into 56% or even 32% of the one in current Internet  en-US  The evaluation result also proves that the excessive prefix  problem of HA could make the smaller ISPs faced  with big  challenges  It is verified  in our evaluation  that some  deploy ment s  of HA could greatly reduce  the global FIB size in DFZ  The global  FIB size only increases from 85 to 37,663  from C 0  to  C 12   However, the FIB size s  of the ASes which may belong to smal ler ISPs could be  very large For example AS18302 is the AS  which owns the maximum routing table size from C 0  to C 1 2 Its FIB size is decreased from 22,955,176  to 356,826 AS18302  locates at the 44 th  level which is definitely not the top tier AS Therefor e it is shown that  although the global routing table is reduced significantly the  routing tables in the smaller ISPs could be large. Th e se smaller ISPs could not operate normally or at least have to face a big   en-US  en-US Fig. 3  T he distributi on of routing table \(RIB  size  in  C i  en-US  en-US

Firstly we define the model of the prefix assignment and the routing advertisement in different HA deployment ways C i  U sing  real Internet routing  data, we simulate the processes of prefix  assignment and routing advertisement in  different C i s  based on  en-US the decomposition of actual Internet topology  We found that w hen i  gets bigger, the prefix amou nt of arbitrary AS in C i  is  getting smaller  while t he global  FIB  size in C 0 C 50  increases monotonically   Comparing  with the actual Internet  data   it is concluded that C 1 8 and C 1 9  are suitable HA deployment ways in which the distribution of prefix amount is closer to the one of today  s Internet and the global FIB size could be reduced into 56 or even 32 of the one in current Internet Since the decision of the suitable HA deployment ways depends on the Internet topology our conclusion on the deployment ways of HA may be not suitabl e for the future Internet. But, we give an insight for the addressing  of the future Internet. In addition the evaluation result also proves that some HA deployment methods are not suitable to current Internet e.g the global deployment, since they may ma ke some small ISPs faced with a big increase of the operation cost by increasing sharply their routing table sizes In future work we hope to prove th e  evaluation result by the mathematics derivation  en-US A CKNOWLEDGMENT  en-US The research was supported in part by the National High tech Researchand Development Program 863 Program of China under Grant No  2011AA01A101 and No 2013AA013301  the National Basic Research Program 973 Program of  China under Grant No 2009CB320504  and National Science and Technology Ma jor Project under Gra n te No. 2012ZX03002008 002 03  en-US  en-US R EFERENCES  en-US 1  T  T.

15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
