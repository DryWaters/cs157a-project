One of the important challenges in\nprocessing big data in the Clouds is how to effectively partition\nthe big data to ensure ef?cient distributed processing of the data.\nIn this paper we present a Scalable and yet customizable data\nPArtitioning framework, called SPA for distributed processing\nof big RDF graph data. We choose big RDF datasets as our\nfocus of the investigation for two reasons. First, the Linking\nOpen Data cloud has put forwards a good number of big RDF\ndatasets with tens of billions of triples and hundreds of millions\nof links. Second, such huge RDF graphs can easily overwhelm\nany single server due to the limited memory and CPU capacity\nand exceed the processing capacity of many conventional data\nprocessing software systems. Our data partitioning framework\nhas two unique features First, we introduce a suite of vertex-\ncentric data partitioning building blocks to allow ef?cient and\nyet customizable partitioning of large heterogeneous RDF graph\ndata. By ef?cient, we mean that the SPA data partitions can\nsupport fast processing of big data of different sizes and com-\nplexity. By customizable, we mean that the SPA partitions are\nadaptive to different query types. Second, we propose a selection\nof scalable techniques to distribute the building block partitions\nacross a cluster of compute nodes in a manner that minimizes\ninter-node communication cost by localizing most of the queries\non distributed partitions. We evaluate our data partitioning\nframework and algorithms through extensive experiments using\nboth benchmark and real datasets. Our experimental results show\nthat the SPA data partitioning framework is not only ef?cient for\npartitioning and distributing big RDF datasets of diverse sizes\nand structures but also effective for processing big data queries\nof different types and complexity.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCloud computing infrastructures are widely recognized as\nan attractive computing platform for ef?cient big data pro-\ncessing because it minimizes the upfront ownership cost for\nthe large-scale computing infrastructure demanded by big\ndata analytics. With Linking Open Data community project\nand World Wide Web Consortium \(W3C RDF\n\(Resource Description Framework  steady growth\nof both big RDF datasets and large and growing number of\ndomains and applications capturing their data in RDF and\nperforming big data analytics over big RDF datasets. For\nexample, more than 52 billion RDF triples are published as of\nMarch 2012 on Linked Data [12] and about 6.46 billion triples\nare provided by the Data-gov Wiki [7] as of February 2013.\nRecently the UK \(United Kingdom its legislation [8] with a SPARQL \(a standard query\nlanguage for RDF 5].\nHadoop MapReduce programming model and Hadoop Dis-\ntributed File System \(HDFS popular\ndistributed computing technologies for distributing big data\nprocessing across a large cluster of compute nodes in the\nCloud. However, processing the huge RDF data using Hadoop\nMapReduce and HDFS poses a number of new technical\nchallenges. First, when viewing a big RDF dataset as an RDF\ngraph, it typically consists of millions of vertices \(subjects or\nobjects of RDF triples of\nedges \(predicates of RDF triples partitioning\nof big data into chunks through either horizontal \(by triples by subject, object or predicate simple partitioning method tend to have high\ncorrelation with one another. Thus, most of the RDF queries\nneed to be processed through multiple rounds of data shipping\nacross partitions hosted in multiple compute nodes in the\nCloud. Second, HDFS \(and its attached storage systems row objects\nare independent and thus big data can be simply divided into\nequal-sized chunks which can be stored in a distributed manner\nand processed in parallel ef?ciently and reliably. However,\nHDFS is not optimized for processing big RDF datasets\nof high correlation. Therefore, even simple retrieval queries\ncan be quite inef?cient to run on HDFS. Third but not the\nleast, Hadoop MapReduce programming model is optimized\nfor batch-oriented processing jobs over big data rather than\nreal-time request and respond types of jobs. Thus without\ncorrelation preserving data partitioning, Hadoop MapReduce\nalone is neither adequate for handling RDF queries nor suitable\nfor structure-based reasoning on RDF graphs.\nWith these challenges in mind, in this paper, we present a\nScalable and yet customizable data PArtitioning framework,\ncalled SPA, for distributed processing of big RDF graph data.\nOur data partitioning framework has two unique features. First,\nwe introduce a suite of vertex-centric data partitioning building\nblocks, called extended vertex blocks, to allow ef?cient and\nyet customizable data partitioning of large heterogeneous\nRDF graphs by preserving the basic vertex structure. By\nef?cient, we mean that the SPA data partitions can support fast\nprocessing of big data of 


different sizes and complexity. By\ncustomizable, we mean that one partitioning technique may\nnot ?t all. Thus the SPA partitions are by design adaptive\nto different data processing demands in terms of structural\ncorrelations. Second, we propose a selection of scalable par-\nallel processing techniques to distribute the structured vertex\nblock-based partitions across a cluster of compute nodes in\na manner that minimizes inter-node communication cost by\nlocalizing most of the queries to independent partitions and\nby maximizing intra-node processing.

OVERVIEW\nA. RDF and SPARQL\nAn RDF dataset consists of \(subject, predicate, object or so-called SPO triples represent-\ning a relationship between its subject and object. An RDF\ndataset can be depicted as an RDF graph with subjects and\nobjects as vertices and predicates as labeled edges connecting\na pair of subject and object Each edge is directed, emanating\nfrom its subject vertex to its object vertex. Fig. 1\(a graph based on the structure of SP2Bench\n\(SPARQL Performance Benchmark  query language for RDF\nrecommended by W3C. Most SPARQL queries consist of\nmultiple triple patterns, which are similar to RDF triples except\nthat in each triple pattern, the subject, predicate and object may\nbe a variable. We categorize SPARQL queries into two types:\nstar and complex, based on the join characteristics of triple\npatterns. Star queries consist of subject-subject joins and each\njoin variable is the subject of all the triple patterns involved.\nWe refer to the remaining queries as complex queries. Fig. 1\(b example SPARQL query graphs. The ?rst is a\nstar query requesting the year of publication of Journal\n1 and the second is a complex query requesting the names\nof all persons who are an author of at least one publication\nof inproceeding type. SPARQL query processing can be\nviewed as ?nding matching subgraphs in the RDF graph where\nRDF terms from those subgraphs may be substituted for the\nquery variables.\nB. System Architecture\nFig. 2 sketches the architecture of our RDF data partitioning\nframework SPA. The ?rst prototype of SPA is implemented\non top of Hadoop MapReduce and HDFS. The Hadoop SPA\nframework consists of one coordinator and a set of worker\nnodes \(VMs JobTracker of Hadoop\nMapReduce and each worker serves as the DataNode of HDFS\nSPA coordinator \nQuery nInterface & \nExecutor \nNameNode \nJobTracker \nBuilding \nBlock \nGenerator & \nDistributor \nVM Pool \nVM VM VM VM VM \nVM \nTaskTracker \nDataNode \nRDF Storage \nSystem \nFig. 2: SPA Architecture\nand the TaskTracker of Hadoop MapReduce. To ef?ciently\nstore the generated partitions, we utilize an RDF-speci?c\nstorage system on each worker node.\nThe core components of our RDF data partitioning frame-\nwork are the partition block generator and distributor. The\ngenerator uses a vertex-centric approach to construct partition\nblocks such that all triples of each partition block are residing\nin the same worker node. For a big RDF graph with a huge\nnumber of vertices, we need to carefully distribute all gener-\nated partition blocks across a cluster of worker nodes using\na partition distribution mechanism. We provide an ef?cient\ndistributed implementation of our data partitioning system on\ntop of Hadoop MapReduce and HDFS.\nIII. SPA: DATA PARTITIONING FRAMEWORK\nIn this section we describe the SPA data partitioning\nframework, focusing on the two core components constructing\nthe partition blocks and distributing them across multiple\nworker nodes. In order to provide partitioning models that are\ncustomizable to different processing needs, we devise three\ntypes of partition blocks based on the vertex structure and the\nvertex access pattern. The goal of constructing partition 


blocks\nis to assign all triples of each partition block to the same\nworker node in order to support ef?cient query processing.\nIn terms of ef?cient query processing, there are two different\ntypes of processing: intra-VM processing and inter-VM pro-\ncessing. By intra-VM processing, we mean that a query Q can\nbe fully executed in parallel on each VM by locally searching\nthe subgraphs matching the triple patterns of Q, without\nany coordination from one VM to another. The coordinator\nsimply sends Q to all worker nodes \(VMs using\nHadoop, and then merges the partial results received from\nall VMs to generate the ?nal results of Q. By inter-VM\nprocessing, we mean that a query Q as a whole cannot be\nexecuted on any VM, and it needs to be decomposed into a\nset of subqueries such that each subquery can be evaluated\nby intra-VM processing. Thus, the processing of Q requires\nmultiple rounds of coordination and data transfer across the\n328\ncluster of workers using Hadoop. In contrast to intra-VM\nprocessing, inter-VM communication cost can be extremely\nhigh especially when the number of subqueries is not small\nand the size of intermediate results to be transferred across the\nnetwork of worker nodes is large.\nA. Constructing Extended Vertex Blocks\nWe center our data partitioning on a vertex-centric approach.\nBy vertex-centric, it means that we construct a vertex block\nfor each vertex. By extending a vertex block to an extended\nvertex block we can assign more triples which are close to\na vertex in the same partition for ef?cient query processing.\nBefore we formally de?ne the concept of vertex block and the\nconcept of extended vertex block, we ?rst de?ne some basic\nconcepts of RDF graphs.\nDe?nition 1. \(RDF Graph V,E,?E , lE where V\nis a set of vertices and E is a multiset of directed edges \(i.e.,\nordered pairs of vertices directed edge \(u, v available labels \(i.e., predicates E ? ?E datasets, multiple triples may have the same subject\nand object. Thus E is a multiset instead of a set. We consider\nthat two triples in an RDF dataset are correlated if they share\nthe same subject, object or predicate. For simplicity, only\nvertex-based correlation is considered in this paper. Thus we\nonly consider three types of correlated triples as follows:\nDe?nition 2. \(Different types of correlated triples n\(V,E,?E , lE triples vertex is v as the\nout-triples of vertex v, denoted by Eoutv = {\(v, o v, o of edges \(triples s v s, v denoted\nby Ebiv = E\nout\nv ? Einv .\nNow we de?ne the concept of vertex block, the basic\nbuilding block for graph partitioning. A vertex block can\nbe represented by a vertex ID and its connected triples. An\nintuitive way to construct the vertex block of a vertex v is to\ninclude all connected triples \(i.e., bi-triples regardless\nof their direction. However, for some RDF datasets, all their\nqueries may request only triples in one direction from a\nvertex. For example, to evaluate the ?rst SPARQL query in\nFig. 1\(b needs only out-triples of a\nvertex which may be substituted for variable ?journal.\nSince one partitioning technique cannot ?t all, we need to\nprovide customizable options that can be ef?ciently used for\ndifferent RDF datasets and SPARQL query types. In addition\nto query ef?ciency, partition blocks should also minimize the\ntriple redundancy by considering only necessary triples and\nreducing the disk space of generated partitions. This motivates\nus to introduce three different ways of de?ning the concept of\nvertex blocks based on the edge direction of triples.\nDe?nition 3. \(Vertex block V,E,?E , lE Out-vertex block of a vertex v ? V is a subgraph\nof G which consists of v and its out-triples, denoted by\nV Boutv = \(V\nout\nv , E\nout\nv ,?Eoutv , lEoutv n“BBB” \nPerson \nPerson2 “title” \n“note” “110” “abstract” \n“4” \nJournal1 \n_:DD \nArticle \nProc1 \nInProceedings n“title” \n“47” \n“http” \n“1950” \n“InProc 1” \nFig. 3: 2-hop extended bi-vertex block of “Person1”\n{vout|vout V, \(v, vout V\nin\nv , E\nin\nv ,?Einv , lEinv  vin, v combination of both out-vertex\nblock and in-vertex block, namely the bi-vertex block, and is\nformally de?ned as V Bbiv = \(V\nbi\nv , E\nbi\nv ,?Ebiv , lEbiv v, vbi vbi v has an anchor vertex. We\nrefer to those vertices in a vertex block, which are not the\nanchor vertex, as the border vertices of this vertex block.\nIn the rest of the paper we will use vertex blocks to refer to\nall three types of vertex blocks and use bi-vertex block to refer\nto the combination of in-vertex block and out-vertex block.\nFig. 1\(c block in the\nsame partition, we can ef?ciently process all queries which\nrequest only triples directly connected to a vertex because\nthose queries can be processed using intra-VM processing.\nFor example, to 


process the star query in Fig. 1\(b because it is guaranteed that all triples connected to a\nvertex which can be substituted for the variable journal\nare located in the same VM.\nEven though the vertex blocks are bene?cial for star queries,\nwhich are common in practice, there are some RDF datasets\nin which chain queries or more complex queries may request\nmore triples that are beyond those directly connected triples.\nConsider the second query in Fig. 1\(b Clearly there is no\nguarantee that any triple connecting from ?person to ?name\nis located in the same partition where those connected triples\nof vertex ?inproc are located. Thus inter-VM processing\nmay be required. This motivates us to introduce the concept\nof k-hop extended vertex block \(k ? 1 V in an RDF graph G, k-hop extended\nvertex block of v includes not only directly connected triples\nbut also all nearby triples which are indirectly connected to\nthe vertex within k-hop radius in G. Thus, a vertex block of\nv is the same as the 1-hop extended vertex block of v.\nSimilar to the vertex block, we de?ne three different ways of\nde?ning the extended vertex block based on the edge direction\nof triples: k-hop extended out-vertex block, k-hop extended\nin-vertex block and k-hop extended bi-vertex block. Similarly,\ngiven a k-hop extended vertex block anchored at v, we refer\nto those vertices that are not the anchor vertex of the extended\nvertex block as the border vertices. For example, Fig. 3 shows\nthe 2-hop extended bi-vertex block of vertex Person1. Due\nto the space limitation, we omit the formal de?nitions of the\nthree types of the k-hop extended vertex block in this paper.\nWe below discuss brie?y how to set the system-de?ned\n329\nparameter k. For a given RDF dataset, we can de?ne k based\non the common types of queries we wish to provide fast\nevaluation If the radius of most of such queries is 3 hops\nor less, we can set k = 3. The higher k value is, the higher\ndegree of triple replication each data partition will have and\nthus more queries can be evaluated using intra-VM processing.\nIn fact, we ?nd that the most frequent queries have 1 hop or\n2 hops as their radius.\nOnce the system-de?ned k value is set, in order to determine\nif a given query can be evaluated using intra-VM processing\nor it has to pay inter-VM processing cost, all we need to do\nis to check whether every vertex in the corresponding query\ngraph can be covered by any k-hop extended vertex block.\nConcretely, if there is any vertex in the query graph whose k-\nhop extended vertex block includes all triple patterns \(edges graph, then we can say that the query can be\nevaluated using intra-VM processing under the current k-hop\ndata partitioning scheme.\nIn the ?rst prototype of SPA system, we implement our\nRDF data partitioning schemes using Hadoop MapReduce and\nHDFS. First, users can use the SPA con?guration to set some\nsystem-de?ned parameters including the number of worker\nnodes used for partitioning, say n, the type of extended vertex\nblocks out-vertex, in-vertex or bi-vertex the SPA\ndata partitioner will launch a set of Hadoop jobs to partition\nthe triples of the given dataset into n partitions based on the\ndirection and the k value of the extended vertex blocks.\nThe ?rst Hadoop job reads the input RDF dataset stored\nin HDFS chunks. For each chunk, it examines triples one by\none and groups triples by two partitioning parameters: \(i out-vertex, in-vertex or bi-\nvertex which de?nes the direction of the k-hop extension on\nthe input RDF graph; \(ii vertex\nblocks. If the parameters are set to generate 1-hop extended\nbi-vertex blocks, each triple is assigned to two extended vertex\nblocks \(or one block if the subject and object of the triple is\nthe same entity can be viewed as indexing this triple\nby both its subject and object. However, if the parameters are\nset to generate 1-hop extended out-vertex or in-vertex blocks,\neach triple will be assigned to one extended vertex block based\non its subject or object respectively. We below describe how\nthe SPA data partitioner takes the input RDF data and uses\na cluster of compute nodes to partition it into n partitions\nbased on the settings of 2-hop extended out-vertex blocks. In\nour ?rst prototype, the SPA data partitioner is implemented in\ntwo phases: Phase 1 generates vertex blocks or 1-hop extended\nvertex blocks, and Phase 2 generates k-hop extended vertex\nblocks for k > 1. If k = 1, only Phase 1 is needed.\nIn the following discussion, we assume that the RDF dataset\nto be partitioned has been loaded into HDFS. The ?rst Hadoop\njob is initialized with a set of map tasks in which each map\ntask reads a ?xed-size data chunk from HDFS \(the chunk size\nis initialized as a part of the HDFS con?guration key-value pair where the key is the subject vertex and the\nvalue is the remaining part \(predicate and object of the triple.\nThe local combine function of this Hadoop job groups all key-\nvalue pairs that have the same key into a local subject-based\ntriple group for each subject. The reduce function reads the\noutputs of all maps to further merge all local subject-based\ngroups to form a vertex block with the subject as the anchor\nvertex. Each vertex group will have one anchor vertex and\nbe stored in HDFS as a whole. Upon the completion of this\n?rst Hadoop job, we obtain the full set of 1-hop extended\nout-vertex blocks for the RDF dataset.\nIn the next Hadoop job, we examine each triple against\nthe set of 1-hop extended out-vertex blocks 


obtained in the\nprevious phase, to determine which extended vertex blocks\nshould include this triple in order to meet the k-hop guarantee.\nWe call this phase the controlled triple replication. Concretely,\nwe perform a full scan of the RDF dataset and examine in\nwhich 1-hop extended out-vertex blocks this triple should be\nadded in two steps. First, for each triple, one key-value pair\nis generated with the subject of the triple as the key and the\nremaining part \(predicate and object the same subject into a local\nsubject-based triple group. In the second step, for each 1-hop\nextended out-vertex block and each subject with its local triple\ngroup, we test if the subject vertex matches the extended out-\nvertex block. By matching, we mean that the subject vertex\nis the border vertex of the extended out-vertex block. If a\nmatch is found, then we create a key-value pair with the\nunique ID of the extended out-vertex block as the key and\nthe subject vertex of the given local subject-based triple group\nas the value This ensures that all out-triples of this subject\nvertex are added to the matching extended out-vertex block If\nthere is no matching extended out-vertex block for the subject\nvertex, the triple group of the subject vertex is discarded.\nThis process is repeated until all the subject-based local triple\ngroups are examined against the set of extended out-vertex\nblocks. Finally, we get a set of 2-hop extended out-vertex\nblocks by the reduce function, which merges all key-value\npairs with the same key together such that the subject-based\ntriple groups with the same extended out-vertex block ID \(key out-vertex block to obtain the\n2-hop extended out-vertex block and store it as a HDFS ?le.\nFor k > 2, we will repeat the above process until the k-\nhop extended vertex blocks are constructed. In our experiment\nsection we report the performance of the SPA partitioner in\nterms of both the time complexity and data characteristics of\ngenerated partitions to illustrate why partitions generated by\nthe SPA partitioner is much more ef?cient for RDF graph\nqueries than random partitioning by HDFS chunks.\nB. Distributing Extended Vertex Blocks\nAfter we construct the extended vertex block for each\nvertex, we need to distribute all the extended vertex blocks\nacross the cluster of worker nodes. Since there are usually a\nhuge number of vertices in RDF data, we need to carefully\nassign each extended vertex block to a worker node. We\nconsider three objectives for distribution of extended vertex\nblocks: \(i ii replication and \(iii nodes.\nFirst, balanced partitions are essential for ef?cient query\nprocessing because one big partition in the imbalanced par-\ntitions may be a bottleneck for query processing and so\nwill increase the overall query processing time. Second, by\n330\nthe de?nition of the extended vertex block, a triple may be\nreplicated in several extended vertex blocks. If vertex blocks\nhaving many common triples can be assigned to the same\npartition, the storage cost can be reduced considerably because\nduplicate triples are eliminated on each worker node. When\nmany triples are replicated on multiple partitions, the enlarged\npartition size will increase the query processing cost on each\nworker node. Therefore, reducing the number of replicated\ntriples is also an important factor critical to ef?cient query\nprocessing. Third, when selecting the distribution mechanism,\nwe need to consider the processing time for the distribution\nof extended vertex blocks. This criterion is also important for\nRDF datasets that require more frequent updates.\nIn the ?rst prototype of SPA partitioner, we implement\ntwo alternative techniques for distribution of extended vertex\nblocks to the set of worker nodes: hashing-based and graph\npartitioning-based. The hashing-based technique can achieve\nthe balanced partitions and take less time to complete the\ndistribution. It assigns the extended vertex block of vertex v\nto a partition using the hash value of v. We can also achieve\nthe second goal ? reducing replication by developing a smart\nhash function based on the semantics of the given dataset.\nFor example, if we know that vertices having the same URI\npre?x are closely connected in the RDF graph, then we can\nuse the URI pre?x to get the hash value, which will assign\nthose vertices to the same partition.\nThe graph partitioning-based distribution technique utilizes\nthe partitioning result of the minimum cut vertex partitioning\nalgorithm [15 The minimum cut vertex partitioning algorithm\ndivides the vertices of a graph into n smaller partitions by\nminimizing the number of edges between different partitions.\nWe generate a vertex-to-worker-node map based on the result\nof the minimum cut vertex partitioning algorithm. Then we\nassign the extended vertex block of each vertex to the worker\nnode using the vertex-to-node map. Since it is likely that close\nvertices are included in the same partition and thus placed\non the same worker node, this technique focuses on reducing\nreplication by assigning close vertices, which are more likely\nto have common triples in their extended vertex blocks, to the\nsame partition.\nC. Distributed Query Processing\nGiven that intra-VM processing and inter-VM processing\nare two types of distributed query processing in our frame-\nwork, for a SPARQL query Q, assuming that the partitions\nare generated based on the k-hop extended vertex block, we\nconstruct a k-hop extended vertex block for each vertex in\nthe query graph of Q. If any k-hop extended vertex block\nincludes all 


edges in the query graph of Q, we can process\nQ using intra-VM processing because it is guaranteed that\nall triples which are required to process Q are located in the\nsame partition. If there is no such k-hop extended vertex block,\nwe need to process Q using inter-VM processing by splitting\nQ into smaller subqueries. In this paper, we split the query\nwith an aim of minimizing the number of subqueries. We\nuse Hadoop MapReduce and HDFS to join the intermediate\nresults generated by the subqueries. Concretely, each subquery\nis executed on each VM and then the intermediate results of\nthe subquery are stored in HDFS. To join the intermediate\nresults of all subqueries, we use the join variable values as\nkey values of a Hadoop job.\nIV. EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we report the experimental evaluation of\nour RDF data partitioning framework. Our experiments are\nperformed using not only different benchmark datasets but\nalso various real datasets. We ?rst introduce basic character-\nistics of datasets used for our evaluation. We categorize the\nexperimental results into two sets 1 balanced partitions, replicated triples and\ndata partitioning and distribution time. \(2 the\nexperiments on query processing latency.\nA. Setup\nWe use a cluster of 21 machines \(one is the coordinator on\nEmulab [21]: each has 12 GB RAM, one 2.4 GHz 64-bit quad\ncore Xeon E5530 processor and two 250GB 7200 rpm SATA\ndisks. The network bandwidth is about 40 MB/s. When we\nmeasure the query processing time, we perform ?ve cold runs\nunder the same setting and show the fastest time to remove\nany possible bias posed by OS and/or network activity.\nTo store each generated partition on each machine, we\nuse RDF-3X [18] version 0.3.5 which is a RDF storage\nsystem. We also use Hadoop version 0.20.203 running on\nJava 1.6.0 to run various partitioning algorithms and join the\nintermediate results generated by subqueries. In addition to\nour RDF data partitioning framework, we have implemented\na random partitioning for comparison, which randomly assigns\neach triple to a partition. Random partitioning is often used as\nthe default data partitioner in Hadoop MapReduce and HDFS.\nTo show the bene?ts of different building blocks of our\npartitioning framework, we experiment with ?ve different\nextended vertex blocks: 1-hop extended out-vertex block \(1-\nout 1-in 1-bi 2-\nout in-vertex block \(2-in in terms of balanced partitions, triple replication and\nthe time to complete the distribution. We use the graph parti-\ntioner METIS [4] version 5.0.2 with its default con?guration\nto implement the graph partitioning-based distribution.\nB. Datasets\nWe use two different benchmark generators and three differ-\nent real datasets for our experiments. To generate benchmark\ndatasets, we utilize two famous RDF benchmarks LUBM\n\(Lehigh University Benchmark   We generate\ntwo datasets having different sizes from each benchmark:\n\(i 67M triples 267M triples ii and 200 million\ntriples respectively.

It is interesting to note that, even\nthough a huge number of objects have less than 100 incoming\nedges, there are still many objects having a signi?cant number\nof incoming edges \(e.g. more than 100,000 edges 4\(i j triples for different building blocks using the hashing-\nbased and graph partitioning-based distribution techniques.\nHereafter, we omit the results on LUBM500 and SP2B-100M\nwhich are almost the same with those on LUBM2000 and\nSP2B-200M respectively. The results show that we can get\nalmost perfectly balanced partitions if we extend only outgoing\ntriples when we construct the extended vertex blocks and\nuse the hashing-based distribution technique. These results are\nrelated to the outgoing edge distribution in Fig. 4\(d 4\(i outgoing triples,\nwe can generate balanced partitions by distributing triples\nbased on subjects. For example the maximum number of\noutgoing triples on LUBM2000 is just 14 and 99.99% of\nsubjects on Freebase have less than 200 outgoing triples.\nThe generated partitions using the graph partitioning-based\ndistribution technique are also well balanced when we extend\nonly outgoing edges because METIS has generated almost\nuniform vertex partitions, even though they are a little less\nbalanced than those using the hashing-based technique.\nHowever the results clearly show that it is hard to generate\nbalanced partitions if we include incoming triples for our\nextended vertex blocks, regardless of the distribution tech-\nnique. Since there are many objects having a huge number\nof incoming triples as shown in Fig. 4\(e j may be much bigger than\nthe other partitions. For example, each of two object vertices\non LUBM2000 has about 16 million incoming triples which is\nabout 6% of all triples.

Concretely, to run the graph\npartitioning using METIS, we ?rst need to convert the RDF\ndatasets into METIS input ?les. It is interesting to note that\nthe format conversion time to run METIS considerably varies\nfor different datasets Since each line in a METIS input ?le\nrepresents a vertex and its connected vertices, we need to\ngroup all connected vertices for each vertex in the RDF graph.\nWe have implemented this conversion step using Hadoop\nfor ef?cient processing. Our implementation consists of four\nHadoop MapReduce jobs: \(1 ID to\neach vertex, \(2 3 connected vertices of\n332\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n#T\nri\npl\nes\n \(m\nill\nio\nn a hashing m\nill\nio\nn b hashing 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n#T\nri\npl\nes\n \(m\nill\nio\nn 1-bi\n2-out 2-in\n\(c hashing 20\n#T\nri\npl\nes\n \(m\nill\nio\nn d hashing m\nill\nio\nn e hashing

Table III shows the conversion time and running\ntime of METIS. The conversion time of DBLP is about 7.5\nhours even though it has the smallest number of triples. It\ntook about 35 hours to convert the Freebase to a METIS\ninput ?le. We believe that this is because there are much more\nvertices which are connected to a huge number of vertices on\nFreebase and DBLP as shown in Fig. 4\(e existing\ngraph partitioning tools require similar input formats, this\nresult indicates that the graph partitioning-based distribution\ntechnique may be infeasible for some RDF datasets.\nTABLE III: Graph partitioning time \(sec 27218 130\nFreebase 91826 2610\nDBpedia 3055 504\nFig. 6 shows, for different building blocks, the ratio of the\ntotal number of triples of all generated partitions to that of\nthe original RDF data. A large ratio means that many triples\nare replicated across the cluster of machines through the data\npartitioning. Partitions using the 1-hop extended out-vertex or\nin-vertex blocks have 1 as the ratio because each triple is\nassigned to only one partition based on its subject or object\nrespectively. As we mentioned above, the results show that\nthe graph partitioning-based distribution technique can reduce\nthe number of replicated triples considerably, compared to the\nhashing-based technique. This is because the graph partitioner\ngenerates components in which close vertices, which have\nhigh probability to share some triples in their extended vertex\nblocks, are assigned to the same component. Especially, there\nare only a few replicated triples for the 2-hop extended out-\nvertex blocks. However, for the other extended vertex blocks,\nthe reduction is not so signi?cant if we consider the overhead\nof the graph partitioning-based distribution technique.\nD. Query Processing\nTo evaluate query processing performance on the generated\npartitions, we choose different queries from one benchmark\ndataset \(LUBM2000 DBpedia a set of benchmark queries,\nwe select three among them. Note that Q11 and Q13 are\nslightly changed because our focus is not RDF reasoning.\nWe create three queries for DBpedia because there is no\nrepresentative benchmark queries.\nFig. 7 shows the query processing time of the queries for\nTABLE IV: Queries\nLUBM Q11: SELECT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x <subOrganizationOf> ?y .\n?y <subOrganizationOf> <http://www.University0.edu>}\nLUBM Q13: SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x <rdf:type> <GraduateStudent> .\n?x <undergraduateDegreeFrom> <http://www.University0.edu> }\nLUBM Q14: SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x <rdf:type> <UndergraduateStudent>}\nDBpedia Q1: SELECT ?subject ?similar WHERE n<Barack Obama> <subject> ?subject. ?similar <subject> ?subject. }\nDBpedia Q2: SELECT ?person WHERE { ?person rdf:type> <Person>}\nDBpedia Q3: SELECT ?suc2 ?suc1 ?person WHERE {\n?suc2 <successor> ?suc1 . ?suc1 successor> ?person}\ndifferent building blocks and different distribution techniques.\nAll building blocks ensure intra-VM processing for LUBM\nQ14 and DBpedia Q2 because they are simple retrieval queries\nhaving only one triple pattern. For LUBM Q13, random, 1-in\nand 2-in needs inter-VM processing using Hadoop because\nQ13 is a star query and so all triples sharing the same\nsubject should be located in the same partition for intra-VM\nprocessing. On the other hand, for DBpedia Q1 which is a\nreverse star query where all triple patterns share the same\nobject, random, 1-out and 2-out needs inter-VM processing.\nFor LUBM Q11 and DBpedia Q3 where the object of one\ntriple pattern is linked to the subject of the other triple pattern,\ninter-VM processing is required for random, 1-out and 1-\nin. The results clearly show that using inter-VM processing\nis slower than using intra-VM processing because of the\ncommunication cost across the cluster of machines to join\nintermediate results generated from subqueries. Furthermore,\neach Hadoop job usually has about 10 seconds of initialization\noverhead regardless of its input data size. In terms of the intra-\nVM processing, the difference between the hashing-based\nand the graph partitioning-based distribution techniques is not\nsigni?cant for most cases even though they have different\nbalance and replication levels as shown in Table I and Fig. 6.\nWe think that this is because each partition is ef?ciently stored\nand indexed in the RDF-speci?c storage system, thus such\nlevel of difference on the balance and replication does not\nhave a great effect on query processing. The only notable\ndifference is when we use 2-out for partitioning because\nthe graph partitioning-based technique reduces the number of\nreplicated triples considerably. Especially, on DBpedia where\n2-out using the hashing-based distribution technique generates\nmany replicated triples, 2-out using the 


graph partitioning-\nbased distribution technique is three times faster than that\nusing the hashing-based technique for DBpedia Q3.\nIn summary, we conclude that the most important factor of\nRDF data partitioning is to ensure the intra-VM processing\n333\n01\n2\n3\n4\n1-out 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(a 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(b 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(c DBLP\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n1-out 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(d Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(e Replication\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nQ13\n\(hashing graph hashing graph hashing graph y\n P\nro\nce\nss\nin\ng \nTi\nm\ne \nin\n S\nec\n  \nrandom 1-out\n1-in 1-bi\n2-out 2-in\n\(a LUBM2000\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nQ1\n\(hashing graph hashing graph hashing graph P\nro\nce\nss\nin\ng \nTi\nm\ne \nin\n S\nec\n  \nrandom 1-out\n1-in 1-bi\n2-out 2-in\n\(b Time \(sec or most slower than intra-\nVM processing.

Also it should be noted\nthat running existing graph partitioner can be infeasible for\nsome RDF datasets due to their complex structure.\nV. RELATED WORK\nGraph partitioning has been extensively studied in several\ncommunities for several decades [13], [15]. Recently a number\nof techniques have been proposed to process RDF queries on\na cluster of machines. Most of them utilize existing distributed\n?le systems such as HDFS to store and distribute RDF data.\nSHARD [19] directly stores RDF triples in HDFS as ?at text\n?les and runs one Hadoop job for each clause \(triple pattern  store\nRDF triples and, given a query, iteratively evaluates each triple\npattern of the query on the two tables to generate ?nal results.\nBecause they use general distributed ?le systems which are not\noptimized for RDF data, their query processing is much less\nef?cient than the state-of-the-art RDF storage and indexing\ntechnology [18]. [14] generates partitions using existing graph\npartitioning algorithms and stores them on RDF-3X. As we\nreported in Sec. IV, running an existing graph partitioner for\nlarge RDF data has a huge amount of overhead and is not\nfeasible for some real RDF datasets.\nIn addition, two recent papers [17], [16 have proposed\ntwo different approaches to general processing of big graph\ndata. [17] promotes to store a vertex and all its outgoing\nedges together and implemented a distributed system to show\nthe parallel processing opportunity of their approach. [16]\nproposes to store a vertex and all its incoming edges together\nand shows that this can speed up some graph processing on a\nsingle server, such as PageRank. In comparison, [17] presents\na system built using out-vertex block for both subject and\nobject vertices, whereas 16] presents a single server solution\nusing the in-vertex block for both subject and object vertices.\nBoth are special cases of our SPA partitioner. We argue that\nour SPA framework presents a systematic approach to graph\npartitioning and is more general and easily con?gurable with\ncustomizable performance guarantee.\nVI CONCLUSION\nWe have presented SPA, an ef?cient and customizable\nRDF data partitioning model for distributed processing of\nbig RDF graph data in the Cloud. The main contribution is\nto develop a selection of scalable techniques to distribute the\npartition blocks across a cluster of compute nodes in a manner\nthat minimizes inter-node communication cost by localizing\nmost of the queries on distributed partitions. We show that\nthe SPA approach is not only ef?cient for partitioning and\ndistributing big RDF datasets of diverse sizes and structures\nbut also effective for processing RDF queries of different\ntypes and complexity.\nAcknowledgment This work is partially sponsored by grants\nfrom NSF CISE NetSE program, SaTC program, and Intel\nISTC on Cloud Computing.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “About FacetedDBLP,” http://dblp.l3s.de/dblp++.php.\n[2] “BTC 2012 Dataset http://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/btc-2012/.\n[3] “DBpedia 3.8 Downloads http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads38.\n[4] “METIS,” http://www.cs.umn.edu/˜metis.\n[5] “Opening up Government http://data.gov.uk/sparql.\n[6] “Resource Description Framework \(RDF  Data-gov Wiki,” http://data-gov.tw.rpi.edu/wiki.\n[8] “UK Legislation http://www.legislation.gov.uk/developer/formats/rdf.\n[9] S.

These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

Schiff \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Towards Model-Based Control in Neural Engineering \n \nAbstract: Since the 1950s, we have developed mature theories of modern control the-\nory and computational neuroscience with little interaction between these disciplines. \nWith the advent of computationally efficient nonlinear Kalman filtering techniques n\(developed in robotics and weather prediction increasingly accurate reconstruction of dynamics in a variety \nnormal and disease states in the brain, the prospects for synergistic interaction between these fields are \nnow strong. I will show recent examples of the use of nonlinear control theory for the assimilation and con-\ntrol of single neuron and network dynamics, a control framework for Parkinson’s disease, and the potential \nfor unification in control of spreading depression and seizures. Lastly, I will discuss why the subtle and \ndeep intersection of symmetry, in brains and models, is important to take into account in this transdisci-\nplinary fusion of computational models of the computational brain with real time control.  \n Biographical Sketch: Steven J.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
