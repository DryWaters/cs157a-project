Data Abstraction and Visualisation in Next Step:Experiences from a Government \nServices Delivery Trial \nSanat Kumar Bista, Surya Nepal, Cecile Paris \nCSIRO ICT Centre \nCanberra, Australia \nfirstname.lastname@csiro.au \n \n nAbstract— Online Communities offering support services from \na government body can attract a large number of participants \nand thus grow quickly in terms of interaction volume. This big \ndata can pose a challenge to the community members as well as \nmoderators in reviewing the development of discussions and in \nunderstanding the social behaviour of the community. For the \ndata to be useful, it is thus important to employ appropriate ndata abstraction and visualisation tools. We implemented a \ngamification based data abstraction and social behaviour based \nvisualisation method in the context of Next Step, a year long \ntrial conducted in partnership with the Australian \nGovernment Department of Human Services to deliver support \nservices to citizens in a transitioning phase. The trial has been \nuseful in drawing lessons that could be important for a scaled-\nup implementation of such government services. In this paper, \nwe present our experiences from the implementation and \ndiscuss future prospects.  \nKeywords- Data Abstraction; Data Visualisation; \nGamificaiton ;Online Community; Government Services \nDelivery; Social Behaviour  \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nUse of online communities e.g., online forums facilitate asynchronous large scale \ndiscussion amongst citizens as well as between citizens and \ngovernment agencies [1, 2]. Findings of the public \nconsultations [3] conducted by the Australian Government  \nDepartment of Finance and Deregulation shows support from \ncitizens for the establishment of a Government’s policy nconsultation blog and discussion forum. Citizen led online \nforums have also emerged following emergency situations \nsuch as hurricane, wildfire and flu pandemic, e.g.,  [4]. Due \nto its effectiveness in supporting behavioural change, online \ncommunities have been deployed in number of domains such \nas health [5-7 education [8] and government [2, 9].          \nDensity of interaction between members and moderators \ngauge the success of online communities as interaction data \nis the key determinant to use metrics [10], sociability and \nusability [11], and member loyalty [12]. Interactions could \nbe direct, a member commenting on a post by another \nmember, or indirect, two members commenting on the same \npost; it could be active, a member commenting on another \nmember’s post, or passive, a member reading another \nmember’s post.  The volume of the interaction data grows \nsignificantly with member activities over a period of time. \nInteraction data is not only a useful source of information to \nunderstand community happenings for members, but it also \nprovides a monitoring tool for  moderators, helping  to take \nnecessary steps to keep the community going. Therefore, a nsocio-behavioural analysis and visualisation of a large set of \ninteraction data is very important for online communities.  \nBut as data grows, both visualisation and appropriate \nabstraction of this data become important. Indeed, they can \nprovide three benefits to community members and \nmoderators: a member participation [13] and \nhelps to bootstrap the interactions in the community, b and members in reviewing the development \nof  discussions [14-16], particularly on taking necessary \nsteps for long term sustainability of the community and c ncommunity [17]. \nA common approach to visualisation of social network \ninteractions is through graph representation, for e.g. Vizster \n[18]. Graph representation offers a two dimensional \nrepresentation of interactions in terms of nodes and links, \nthus offering a visualisation of community happenings. \nOther techniques to interaction visualisation and navigation \nare: focus+context \(f+c and \nrelatives, linking and brushing, interaction dimensions, tree \nand network views, etc. to name a few [19 20].  Our \napproach to interaction abstraction is with an aim of \nunderstanding behaviour of the members in the community. \nThe purpose is to visualise the behavioural abstraction so \nthat it helps to address some fundamental issues related to \nonline communities, more specifically bootstrapping and \nsustainability Bootstrapping deals with the motivation of \npeople to be engaged in the community at the beginning, \nwhereas sustainability deals with the engagement of \nmembers in the community over a longer period of time \(i.e nproviding sustained motivations to members visualisation \nof interaction data based on Gamification [21] and Social \nTrust [22, 23]   to achieve the benefits mentioned above, in \nthe context of  the Next Step [9, 24] online community.  \nNext Step was a year long trial in partnership with the \nAustralian Government Department of Human Services \n\(referred hereafter as Human Services recipients. Our trial targeted parents transitioning \nfrom a parental payment to another income support benefit \nwith the requirement to find a job, a transition that occurs \nwhen their youngest child is reaching school age. \nMembership to community was by invitation only. The \ncommunity was designed to be a place for people to find \nsupport from others in similar situations, with the hypothesis \n2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data\n978-0-7695-5006-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.42\n263\nthat 


this would be helpful in their transition process.  \nIndividuals in the community were strangers to each other nbut they all shared the same circumstance: the transition \nfrom one payment to another.  The community was also a \nplace for Human Services to target its information and \nsupport services when dealing with this specific group of \nwelfare recipients. Components and features of the \ncommunity are shown in Figure 1.  \n \n \n nFigure 1. Next Step Components and Features \nThe home page provides members with tailored \ninformation about the community, while the community \npage informs an individual of events in the community.  As \nwith other online communities, members can participate in \ndiscussions, access a variety of resources, get advice and nshare their experiences.

We present the tools using the \nsample data from our trial and provide lessons learned in the \nform of discussions. We hope this will serve as useful \nguidelines for the design of similar communities.  \nThe remaining of this paper is structured as follows. In \nSection II, we present a review of related work. Data \nabstraction and visualisation methods together with the \nresults from the trial are presented in section III. In Section \nIV, we discuss experiences from the trial, and, finally, \nSection V concludes the paper.    \nII. RELATED WORK \nVisualisation of data from active online communities \nsuch as online forums, social networks, e-commerce \nnetwork, scientific collaboration networks, etc. is a big data \nproblem [25]. The volume and velocity at which such data \nare generated offer opportunities to capture interesting \npatterns for visualisation [26, 27]. Some of the interesting \nvisualisation projects in the recent include Rich Blocks Poor \nBlocks [28], Google Flu trends 29] and Facebook photo \nsharing explosion [30]. All of these projects have used good \nlarge sets of data and produced interesting visualisations for \nunderstanding by common people.  \nThe need for better visualisation of discussions in forums \nis felt across many application domains. Particularly, it has \ngathered interest in visualising student online discussions in \nLearning Management Systems and politically themed \nforums. Jyothi et al. [14] developed a tool to support teachers \nand moderators in reviewing the development of discussion ntopics in the context of virtual learning environments. The \ngraphical representation of forum discussion is believed to be \nuseful to moderators in identifying points for intervention. A \nsecondary objective of their deployment is to gather data \nfrom visualisation for analysis of the discussions in the \nforum.  Hemphill et al. [15] also developed a tool called \noverheard that reveals patterns of interactions in an online ndiscussion board, thus making it easy for the instructors to \nkeep track of student contributions. In [16 the authors \ndescribe the design of a discussion forum visualisation tool \nthat helps users in visualising the content and structure of \ndiscussions in politically themed forums. Features include \nusers being able to receive proactive notification on the \ntopics of interest. Fernanda et al. [31] examine their \nvisualisation method called history flow to do an exploratory \nanalysis of Wikipedia. They propose hypothesis based on npatterns of cooperation and conflict suggested by their \nvisualisation to reason about the success of collective \nauthoring models like that of Wikipedia. Iba et al. [32] talk \nabout a tool they developed to identify the few thousands \nmost creative Wikipedia editors from among the millions of \neditors who are active. Visualisation inspired by theory of \nsocial comparison and social psychology has been used in \n[13] to encourage user participation in online communities. \nThe authors believe that social visibility will encourage nresponsible and reciprocal behaviour in communities.  \nOur approach of badge and social behaviour based nvisualisation offers the complementing abilities to \n264\nunderstand high level as well as finer trends of community \ndevelopment. At a higher level the badge data offers the \noverall trend of member actions, whereas social behaviour \nbased interactions can provide insights at the level of \nindividual interactions between members. The features and \nchallenges are discussed in the subsequent sections.     \nIII.   DATA ABSTRACTION AND VISUALISATION BASED ON \nGAMIFICATION AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR \nData abstraction in Next Step was done by employing a \nbadge based gamification technique, whereas visualisation \nwas based on the social trust calculated on the basis of \nmember’s interactions in the community. The primary use \nof gamification was to reward members with badges for \ntheir contribution in the community, with an objective to \nstimulate community participation.  In this paper, we are \ndiscussing more the indirect benefit of gamification in \noffering an abstraction of user participation. For details of \nthe gamification design in Next Step, we refer the readers 


to \n[33].  \nOur social behaviour model is based on the social trust \nmodel, STrust [22, 23]. It distinguishes two types of \ncommunity members: trusted and trusting people. Trusted \npeople are the ones towards whom others in the community \nhave shown trust, e.g., by providing positive ratings to their \nposts or comments in forums We also refer to these as \npopular members. The interaction model of Strust is \npresented in Figure 2. Trusted popular popularity contrast, trusting people are the source of \nmany interactions towards others \(engagement nothers positive ratings or frequently viewing their forum or \nblog posts. We also refer to them as engaged. \n n \n \n \nFigure 2. STrust Interaction Model \nEngagement can be seen as exhibiting trusting behaviour \ntowards others.  All interactions come about from \nperforming an activity \(e.g., reading, login, viewing, rating ncommenting, etc e.g., forums, live chat, \netc environment in which \nan interaction takes place. Each component of Figure 1 is a \npossible context Interactions could be active or passive. \nActive interactions are visible in the community \(e.g., \nrating commenting, etc e.g., reading both \ntypes of behaviours to rightly assess user participation.  \nFurthermore, an interaction could be direct such as a \nmember sending a buddy invitation to another member, or \nindirect, such as two members reading the same post.  \n \nA. Badge Data  \nTo encourage members to contribute positively and \nfrequently, we rewarded them with a range of ‘badges’ that \ncorrespond to various achievements within the community \ncomponents \(refer to Figure 1 for component descriptions buddies and working on weekly activities attracted \nbadges, some of which were temporary and others npermanent. Temporary badges were refreshed in a \nfortnightly time interval, and members had to sustain a nparticular behaviour to retain a badge. There were also “plus \nversions” of the reader and commenter badges which were \noffered to members securing those badges twice in a row, \nthus highlighting their participation in the forum.  Figure 3 \nsummarises member interactions and the associated badges.   \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Member Interactions and Badges \nFigure 4 shows the badge conferral process. Member \ninteractions \(e.g., reading commenting e.g., forum, toolkit members. The accumulation of points over \na period of time results in the conferral of a badge \(e.g., \nreader badge or commenter badge 5 \nshows the home page with the badges scrolling under the \nrecent achievement section.   \n \nFigure 4. Badge Conferral Process \n265\n \n \nFigure 5. Badges Scrolling in the Member’s Home Page \nThe badges essentially provide a level of abstraction on \nthe interaction data, hiding the details of the underlying user \nbehaviour This offers the members an opportunity to get a \nreflection on their participation in the community. For nexample, if a member has been retaining a reader badge, it \nindicates an active participation through reading actions. \nSimilarly, not having a badge in some category indicates that \nthe member has been lagging behind in the related action. \nAbstract data like this is useful to members both for self \nevaluation and to gain an understanding of the community \n\(since some badges reflect the user’s behaviour comparing to \nothers in the community – e.g., the user is amongst the top \nten people who read the most in the community the knowledge of their own behaviour, they could also \ndiscover behaviour of other members, if they could see the \nbadges held by other members: they could get an overview \nof someone’s behaviour without having to understand the \nfiner details of their participation in the community. This \nexposes some information while still preserving some \nprivacy for other members. In Next Step, due to design \nconstraints such as the strict requirements of privacy, badges \nobtained by members were not made public.  So members \ncould only see their own badges. We discuss the effect of \nthis constraint later in the discussion section.  \nIn addition to the benefits badges provided to members, \nthis abstraction layer is of interest to community moderators \nand the data analysts. Figure 6 presents a sample trend of the \nconferral of four badges in our community, namely reader, \ncommenter, reader plus and commenter plus, over several \nweeks of community life in Next Step.  \n \n nFigure  6. A sample badge conferral trend from Next Step \nUnderstanding the trend from the graph, without having \nto understand low level interaction details, gives a quick \npicture of community happenings to moderators. For \nexample, an increase in commenter badge indicates that there \nwas some content of particular interest to community \nmembers around that time, or potentially an increase in \nparticipation. In our case the increase shown in the graph in \nFigure 6 on week 34 reflects the arrival of new members, \ndue to another round of invitations. Looking at the graphs, \nmoderators also gain insights as to when they need to inject nnew content in the community to boot the participation level.          \nDepending on the number of members and their \nfrequency of participation in a community, the interaction \ndata could easily increase in size. A community like Next \nStep could have many members, if participation is, for \nexample, open as opposed to by 


invitation only.  A large \ncommunity with a high number of members would result \nrich datasets of interest to data analysts. This data could \npossibly be used in analysing and forecasting behaviour \ntrends, beyond what is offered by network visualisation, for \nexample, the correlation between those who comment in the \nforum and those making new friends \(buddies interaction data set provides the following benefits: \na. A badge based leader board \(e.g., the most active nreader in the community, top 10 commentators in \nthe community community. \nb. Temporary badges can encourage members to \nremain active in the community so that they can nretain the badges. \nc. The overall badge trend represents the interests and \nbehaviours of the community helping moderators \nto take necessary steps such as initiating new posts \nor providing new resources, etc. \nB Visualisation Data \nBadge data offers a high level abstraction of community \nhappenings. For example, it can reveal the trend for reading \nand commenting actions, but details such as who reads what \nand how they rate it remains hidden. There was thus a need \nof a lower level visualisation of interactions in the \ncommunity. To fill that need, we deployed a visualisation \nservice framework, called TrustVis, to offer five main nfunctionalities. First, it had to allow one to visualise the \nnetwork’s interactions in different contexts e.g., discussion \nforum and live chat room: refer Figure 7 for the list of \nactions and contexts nFigure 7. Actions and Contexts in Next Step \n266\n  \n \n \nFigure 8.  Sample TrustVis layout and features \n nSecond, it had to allow one to visualise the network \nbased on different user activities, such as rating viewing or \ninviting others to be friends.  Third, it had to support \ntemporal filtering so that one could visualise the network at \ndifferent time intervals. Fourth, it had to support the \nexploration of the network so that one could find information \nabout nodes and edges, including social trust, by navigating \nthough the network without much difficulty. Finally, the \nvisualisation service needed to incorporate role based access nto information to preserve privacy and offer different views \nto different roles. In this way, members and administrators \ncould use the same service, but have different views of the \nnetwork.  Figure 8 presents the layout of TrustVis together \nwith its features. We refer the readers to [17] for design and \nimplementation details of the visualisation service.       \nWhile the community was starting up, with limited \ninteractions between members, visualisation for moderators \nwas not really an issue. With the visits of members and ndiscussions picking up, the density of interactions \nmultiplied, and soon it became impossible to derive any nmeaning out of it without filtering data in terms of actions, \ncontexts or time. Figure 9 presents the visualisation of the \nactions between members in the community at the \nbeginning and end of the trial.    \nA visualisation tool for a community has at least two \ndifferent categories of users, the general members and the \nmoderators. In Next Step, there were three categories of \nusers that could find the visualisation interesting:  the \ngeneral members, the moderators \(from Human Services the researcher involved like badges motivation to contribute more to the \ncommunity. \n \n \n \nFigure 9. Visualisation of Interactions in Next Step a b could help members be more \ninformed on their choice of interaction. For the moderators, \nkeeping track of the fast paced discussions was a real \nchallenge. This visualisation offered support to moderators \nby helping them keep track of the development of member \nactions in the community. Faceted browsing was provided by \nthe action, context and temporal filters, thus offering the \ncapability to visualise active, passive, trusted and trusting \nbehaviour. To both of these categories of users, the \nvisualisation needed to be real time. For analysts, the \nvisualisation was employed to do post analysis of the \ninteraction data to study interesting correlations and predict \nthe sustainability of the community.  \n267\nThe visualisation tool also lets moderators analyse the \ninteraction data by removing individual members and their \ninteractions. This helps identify members that are important \nto be kept engaged to sustain the community.  In our \ncommunity, the interaction graph becomes sparse and \nfragmented after removing the top 5 members \(in terms of \nnumber of posts the \ninterest of these members through data abstraction \(badges them engaged in \nthe community.    \n \n \nFigure 10. \(a a nremoving top 5 members \nIV. DISCUSSIONS \nPrivacy remains one of the important factors in data \nabstraction and visualisation. There are different types of \nonline communities and different privacy settings may apply nto different communities. These privacy settings are mainly \nspecified in terms and conditions of use. What level of \nabstraction and interaction data should be visible to members \nand moderators depends on privacy setting. Our Next Step \ncommunity was anonymous and closed \(by invitation only was considered private to \nmembers and thus not visible to the moderators \(who were \nstaff from Human 


Services privacy level. As far as interaction data is \nconcerned, there was no mechanism to set the privacy level nWhat to expose of interaction data is an interesting issue, for \ne.g., the interactions between members could be positive or \nnegative \(a member may rate a comment from another \nmember negatively member see this \nnegative rating? This may be counterproductive, if the \nintention was to increase the social trust among members. It \nmight be useful, however, to show the negative ratings to \nmoderators so that they can understand the likes or dislikes \nof community members. High negative ratings towards a \nmember may indicate his/her unacceptable behaviours in the \ncommunity. A moderator could use the visualisation tool to ndetect such behaviours without going through individual \nposts and comments \(the red links in Figure 8 and Figure 9 \nindicate negative ratings or spread in different \ncontexts, as it then becomes difficult to spot easily without a \ncareful reading of all the posts. Another question with \nrespect to the interaction data concerns the trade-off between ntransparency and privacy: How can members visualise their \ninteraction data without violating privacy of others? This is a \nchallenging issue and needs further research. One solution \ncould be to enable members to specify a privacy setting for \ninteraction data, like in popular social networking sites, so \nthat they can decide what types of interaction data is private \nto them.  However, designing usable privacy setting for a nvariety and large set of interaction data is a challenging \nproblem.  \nIn instantiating our models in Next Step, we came to \nrealise that our context applied constraints on the use of \ngamification and visualisation The strict privacy \nrequirement did not allow the badge and visualisation data of \nother members to be visible to the general community. Due \nto this constraint, badges were made visible only to the \nindividual members who had earned them, and the \nvisualisation tool was accessible to the moderators and \nanalysts only. This draws an important lesson for the \nimplementation of similar tools: privacy requirements can \nlimit the possibilities offered by visualisation.  \nThe scrolling of badges was visible to members in real \ntime However, the badge trend like the one presented in \nFigure 6 was obtained through post analysis of the data nAfter implementation, we realised that certain vital statistics \nlike the badge trend data would be best available in a \ncontinuous basis in real time, without the need of post \nanalysis. The advantage of having such continuous real time \ndata is in the ease of intervention identification by \nmoderators. For example if the badges associated with \ncertain actions are dropping, this might indicate a fading \ninterest of members in that action. \n As far as the visualisation is concerned, our specific \nvisualisation tool had some limitations.  Figure 9\(b of the graph, it was hard to extract any \nmeaningful information from it \(illustrating again the \npotential need for abstraction to \naction, context or temporal choice \(to get a graph like the one \nin Figure 8, for example solution for better \nvisualisation of big data could be to apply the principles of \ncartography such as adaptive zooming [34].  \nAlthough we have already identified some limitations, \nour visualisation tool supports the browsing of community \ninteractions at two levels: at the member level, as shown in \nFigure 8 and at the community level, as shown in Figure 9. \nOne can get to the member level by clicking a node at the ncommunity level. We observed that, at the member level, it \nis impossible to plot a reasonable graph when the number of \nmembers with whom the member interacts goes beyond 30. \nTherefore, the graph based representation is not good to \nobserve social behaviour of the community when the number \nof connections grows. Though the nodes in the graph are \nactive \(one can click on the node and go further Descriptions of the links \(e.g., the number of \ninteractions and their contexts nthe link, though. In our work, we observed that active links \nwould be desirable in order to go directly to the context. As \nthe links in our current graph represent the aggregation of \ninteractions between members such functionality could not \nbe provided. How to design an active link that represents \n268\naggregate interactions between members is another \nchallenging issue.  \nIn the current tool, it is difficult to identify the most \npopular and engaged member in the community. One has to \nclick on every node and examine its description, as displayed \nin the Network Information panel \(see Figure 8 intuitive.  One way to address this problem \nwould be to define the size of nodes according to their npopularity and engagement values \(similar to thickness of the \nedges to represent the density of interactions active, passive, direct, indirect nmoderators to identify the nature of the different members \nand target them accordingly.             \nV CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we presented our experiences from the \ndeployment of tools for data abstraction and 


visualisation in \nthe Next Step online community. Though the experiences we \npresented are from our specific situation, there are lessons \nwhich could be of importance to similar projects involving a \nlarge interaction data set. Privacy concerns posed by the \napplication context can limit the capabilities and benefits of nvisualisation. This should thus be resolved in the design \nstage itself. There could also be limitations imposed by the \nrepresentation techniques of visualisation. An early \nidentification of such limitations is necessary to get most out \nof data visualisation involving big data.    \n \nGamification based abstraction helps to understand the \ncommunity members’ interactions. For example, how many \nmembers are reading the posts, how many members are \nactively seeking the buddies, etc. We now also feel that we \nneed to provide different levels abstraction for the content in \nthe forum, such as topic and affect. How would such nabstractions be obtained in real time? One possible solution \nis to crowd-source the abstractions in real time, asking \nmembers not only to rate the comments but also label them \nfor topic and affect.  Other possibilities include the use of \nautomatic natural language tools, to classify a post into \npredefined topics and identify its affect. This needs further \ninvestigation.   \nVI.

ndisorder . \nThe following information is based on the FOFR as the \ncause and cure of anxiety disorders: \na Common treatments of the symptoms: \n• Pharmacology for symptoms \n• Talk therapy to become aware of and reconnect \nwith feelings and emotions from the subconscious.3 \nb emotions and \nother messages from FOFRlhypothalamus and subconscious \ncausing chemical brain imbalance and unpredictable \nbehavior changes. \nc recover from depression: Twice the duration \nto acquire it. \ne lifestyle for \nat least 3 years. Changes to lifestyle that eliminates the \nthreats that the hypothalamus/thalamus determines to be a \nthreat \nt nimproving the long-term relationship between the \nsubconscious and conscious mind and understanding how \nthey communicate. \ng thalamus/hypothalamus to \nits pre-damaged condition, must rely on the natural healing \nby the body. \nh Required work to recover: High. The many years of \ndamage to the thalamus and hypothalamus because of nexposure to the harmful chemicals released by the FOFR \nrequires some changes in lifestyle that are often severe for \nmost people to make. Thus, most people will live with \nanxiety and use the medications to relieve relief from the \nsymptoms rather than adopt the right lifestyle their FOFR \ndemands to stop the progression of the mental illness to \neven more severe behavior changes including suicide. \nX. THE SENSORY INPUT TO THE FOFR nThe sources of the known sensory inputs into the fight-or­\nfight response/thalamus are the ears \(sound light pressure/pain odor temperature, \npressure equivalent to a \nchannel of analog information. This means that if the \nanalog input data were converted to digital telemetry, the \nFOFRlthalamus is receiving about 1 00 GB/S of input data \nfrom each channel of information continuously during \nwaking hours. \nThe sensory input to the subconscious and conscious is far nless during sleep and so data processing decreases allowing \nthe brain to slow down and recover from the day's work \nduring sleep. The FOFR and thalamus and hypothalamus \narea of the brain continues to monitor all the data inputs for \nthreats and remains ready to initiate any action necessary for \nself-preservation. \n12 nXI. THE COMMUNICATIONS BANDWIDTH \nBETWEEN THE SUBCONSCIOUS AND THE \nCONSCIOUS \nUsing feelings, hunches and emotions to communicate from \nthe subconscious to the conscious mind, the information \ninput to the conscious mind from the subconscious mind is \nsignificantly less than the sensory input into the FOFR \nsubsystem. The conscious mind would be easily overloaded \nif it received all the information that the FOFR subsystem nreceived from a person's eyes, ears, nervous system and \nskin and nose. \nThe communications capability between the conscious and \nsubconscious mind is close to zero and this is the reason that \nthe external sensory inputs such as ears, eyes and nose, to \nthe subconscious mind must be used to communicate with \nthe subconscious mind by the conscious mind even though \nboth reside in the same brain. It is confusing to understand \nthat the conscious thoughts are not accessible to the \nsubconscious mind, but they are not. Data exists that the \ncommunications between the subconscious and conscious \nmind is one way thus forcing the conscious mind to use the \nsame communication channels that are used by the \nsubconscious for receiving all other information. \nXII. How PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS PROCESS \nINFORMATION FOR PREDICTING MENTAL ILLNESS \nFigure 21 is the prognostic analysis that was completed on \nthree NASA EUVE satellite rate-gyros used for attitude ncontrol, pointing and reorienting of the NASA Extreme \nUltra-Violet Explorer \(EUVE orbiting \nspace science satellite. The behavior in the data in Figure 2 1  \nfor Gyro B was missed by the engineering analysis that was \ncompleted by the gyro vendor's manufacturing engineers. \nThe duration of time that the equipment telemetry spanned \nin the prognostic analysis in Figure 2 1  is equivalent to that \nof a prelaunch readiness, launch and 30  days of on-orbit \nhistory for a human space flight program. The prognostic nanalysis used the NASA EUVE gyro motor current. All \nthree rate-gyros were operating simultaneously for nredundancy purposes, only two gyros were needed \nfunctionally. The NRTE \(accelerated aging nGyro B telemetry motor current was processed using \nproprietary predictive algorithms. [ 16] \nPredictive algorithms demodulate telemetry behavior from \nthe measurements in time, amplitude, frequency and phase. \nThe demodulation process illustrates the presence of non­\nrepeatable changes that are usually overlooked and nmisdiagnosed as systemic noise from completely normal \nappearing and normal behaving people or systems nFigure 2 1 .

The results of the \nprognostic analysis include the prediction of mental health \nwith certainty. \nFigure 22. The three NASA Hubble Rate Gyros from \nFigure 21 where Gyro B Telemetry Included the nPresence of Accelerated Aging. \n1 3  \nXIII. WHAT IS A THREAT, STRESS, STRESSORS \nAND TRIGGERS \nThese terms need to be defined because they often used \nincorrectly. A threat to the FOFRIhypothalamus/thalamus is ndefined only by the a person's thalamus/hypothalamus and \nis believed to include such events as a dangerous animal \nready to strike, a person attempting to strike someone, a \nperson with a gun that may fire the gun to cause harm. \nStress is the response of the body when the FOFR is \nactivated when the thalamus/hypothalamus recognizes that a \nthreat as defined by the FOFR is present. Early indicators \nthat the FOFR has been activated include: hay \nfever/allergies, canker sores in and around the mouth and \ntongue, chapped lips heartburn, hemorrhoids \(inflamed \nrectum fellow employees, a bully at school, a failing grade \non a test, an angry fried, deadlines, homework, tests nmidterms and finals. \nTriggers are events, places, people, behavior or items that \nevoke a psychological behavior or reaction. Triggers are \nunique and identified only by a person's \nFOFRIthalamus/hypothalamus as a threat. The body \nresponds with a faster heartbeat, faster breathing, \nperspiration and increased blood pressure as well as \npsychological and/or emotional responses. \nXIV.

The Different Rates of Degradation for the \nBrains Subsystems caused by the Chemicals Released by \nthe FOFR Eventually Resulting in Mental Illness. \nThis different rate of degradation for the brain's subsystems \n\(see Figure 23 released by the FOFR long-term is the basis for \nthe application and usability of the prognostic and health nmanagement program to predict and prevent mental illness. \nAs the brain's subsystems degrade in perfonnance their \nfunctionality changes and this change in functionality is \nillustrated in telemetry, using predictive algorithms in a \nPHM \(see Figure 2 1 detennining if an offset \nor non-repeatable transient event \(a.k.a. accelerated aging personnel on board space exploration missions \nby comparing a person's baseline circadian and ultradian nrhythms behavior and real-time circadian and ultradian \nrhythms. If either or both exists, it means that the nFOFRIthalamus is degraded by the harsh chemicals of the \nFOFR and the thalamus will continue to degrade in nperformance enough to cause mental illness in the near \nfuture. \nPredictive algorithms require information from the inside of \nthe active part of a system. Fortunately, the part of the brain \nthat controls circadian rhythms resides next to the thalamus \nand hypothalamus and the behavior that is controlled by the \ncircadian rhythm proved the information to be processed \nusing predictive algorithms. So when the thalamus and nhypothalamus are damaged from the harsh chemicals from \nthe FOFR, the part of the brain that controls the circadian \nrhythms is also damaged due to its location near the \nthalamus and hypothalamus \(see Figure 25 the damage \nis identifiable by using predictive algorithms to process the \n14  \nmeasurements from the body that experience circadian \nrhythm. \nFigure 25. The Location in the Brain where Circadian \nand Ultranian Rhythms Originate Near the Thalamus \nand Hypothalamus that Create the FOFR that are \nDamaged from Long Term Exposure to Cortisol and \nAdrenaline. \n[191Almost every function in the human body exhibits a \ncircadian rhythm and major changes to these rhythms can be \nused to predict mental illness. In ambulatory conditions nenvironmental factors and physical exertion can obscure or \nenhance the expressed rhythms. The three most commonly \nmonitored vital signs are blood pressure \(systolic and \ndiastolic Because these \nvariables exhibit daily rhythms, their normal values vary \nwith the time of day. \nTable 3 shows the normative ranges for these variables. \nCircadian rhythms are produced by natural factors within \nthe body 


but they are also affected by signals from the \nenvironment. Light is the main cue that triggers circadian nrhythms, and turning light on or turning light off trigger the \ngenes that control an organism's internal clocks. Circadian \nrhythms are physical, mental and behavioral changes that \nfollow an approximate 24-hour cycle, responding primarily \nto the light and darkness in a person's immediate \nenvironment. They are found in people, most living things, \nincluding animals, plants and many tiny microbes. \nCircadian rhythms change sleep-wake cycles, hormone \nrelease, body temperature and other important bodily \nfunctions. Researchers have already identified the genes that \ndirect circadian rhythms in people, fruit flies, mice, fungi \nand several other model organisms. \nCircadian rhythms determine many human behavioral \npatterns.[201 The body's master clock controls the production \nof melatonin, a honnone for sleep. The area of the brain that \ncreates circadian rhythms is located just above the optic \nnerves, which relay infonnation about the incoming light to nthe eyes. When there is less light-like at night-the area \ntells the brain to make more melatonin so a person gets \ndrowsy. Ultradian rhythms are events in the body that are \nrepeated throughout a 24-hour circadian day In contrast, \ninfradian rhythms, are events such as the human menstrual \ncycle, have period longer than a day nTable 3.

THE FACTORS FOR PREDICTING \nMENTALLY ILL AND FOR CURING MENTAL \nILLNESS \nUltradian rhythms also control hwnan movements sleep, \nattention span and alertness .  A continuum exists from the \nmolecular genetics, through the cellular and neuroendocrine \nto the behavioral and psychosocial levels. The ultradian \nrhythms have far-reaching consequences for our \nunderstanding of human physiological and mental health \nand disease. Some ultradian cycling of the body include \nhormonal release, heart rate, thermoregulation, urination, \nbowel activity nostril dilation and appetite. The last \ninvolves rhythmic release of Neuropeptide Y \(NPY nCorticotropin-releasing hormone \(CRR by recognizing the presence \nof changes to the circadian rhythms that are caused by the \nlack of the following items in a person's  life. Mental illness \ncan be cured by having the same factors prominent in a \nperson's life. The healing of the brain can be increased by \nthinking of the brain as a part of the physical body.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration. This infonnation will be \nused to create a baseline behavior for comparison with \nactual data to discriminate between nonnal and abnormal nbehavior. \nTable 3 is a list of biological diagnostic measurements to be \nincluded in CCSDS telemetry available for ground \npersonnel to complete a prognostic analysis used to predict \nmental illness would be occurring in the near future. In the \nevent that the presence of accelerated aging is identified, \nindicating that mental illness will occur, changes to the \nenvironment to the environment can be made to prevent \nmental illness from occurring. \nTable 3 includes 3 5  measurements are from the circadian \nand ultranian rhythms including the value for the least \nsignificant bit \(LSB into telemetry in the CCSDS format and the \nexpected extreme range that the measurement will need to \nmeasure across and not be exceeded.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
