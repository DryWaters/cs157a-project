    Due to data forwarding and path selection characteristics based on MAC address, WLAN mesh networks requires additional operations to achieve end-to-end data delivery using IPv6 address. IPv6 neighbor discovery operation in WLAN mesh networks needs repeated all-node broadcasting and this gives rise to a big burden in the entire mesh networks. In this paper, we propose the efficient IPv6 neighbor discovery method in multi-hop WLAN mesh networks. The proposed scheme utilizes the pre-configured proxy neighbor table. It has been shown from simulation experiments that the control overhead and communication setu p latency can be significantly reduced using the proposed proxy mechanism P-2 11  Efficient IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Scheme for Wireless LAN Mesh networks Jihoon Lee Samsung Electronics 9 7 8 1 4 2 4 4 2 5 5 9 4  0 9   2 5  0 0   2 0 0 9  I E E E   I INTRODUCTION Recently, the number of wireless-enabled devices such as laptops, PDAs, and mobile phones has been growing rapidly Together with that, WMN is regarded as a promising wireless technology for numerous applications, e.g., broadband home networking, community networks, and building automation etc. through its self-configuring and easy-to-setup capabilities Even though IEEE 802.11 WMN [1, 3  i s reg ar ded as t h e efficient solution for broadband wireless networks, there has been little consideration for IPv6 protocol interactions with WMN. That is, non-mesh devices in WMN need other node’s MAC address to initiate specific applications. At this time, the IPv6 neighbor discovery control messages  m a y  be  a  bi g burden in multi-hop WMN due to its flooding delivery feature The neighbor solicitation \(NS\ packet uses all-node broadcasting to obtain the destination’s MAC address Moreover, the destination node needs multi-hop path information towards the source node to transmit the neighbor advertisement message as a response of NS message. From this process, flooding-based delivery is repeatedly used and this results in the degradation of network throughput II P ROBLEMS   IP V 6 OVER WLAN  M ESH N ETWORKS  The basic IPv6 neighbor discovery operation over WLAN mesh networks is shown in Fig. 1. Suppose that the source node \(X\ust resolve the MAC address of the target node \(Y to send data packets. So, the node X initiates the address resolution \(IP to MAC\ for target node Y using IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol. The neighbor solicitation \(NS\ message is distributed within the entire WLAN mesh networks. After receiving the NS message, the target node Y sends back a neighbor advertisement \(NA\essage to the source node X At this time, if the target node Y does not know a path to the   source node X, this requires the target node Y to initiate the path discovery operation towards the node X for NA delivery The path request \(PREQ\ message [1   whi c h i s i ni t i a t e d f r om  the target node Y to look for the path to the node X, will be flooded again within the whole networks. On receiving the PREQ message initiated from the node Y, node X replies to the PREQ message by sending out a path reply \(PREP message [1  On ce t h e no d e Y receiv e s th e PREP it  b egin s  t o  forward the neighbor advertisement \(NA\the node X using the path obtained from the path discovery operation. After receiving the NA, the source node X can finally start to forward data packets towards the target node Y      Fig. 1.  Neighbor discovery over WLAN mesh networks  Due to twice flooding operations during path discovery and neighbor discovery phases \(i.e., NS and PREQ messages\he existing scheme brings large amount of control messages as well as long communication setup delay and also gives rise to high consumption of wireless links with bandwidth constraints III P ROPOSED P ROXY BASED NEIGHBOR DISCOVERY SCHEME  In the proposed proxy approach, a root portal \(RP\ node [1 is utilized to execute neighbor discovery mechanism. For this a RP node periodically announces itself with the portal announcement message that contains the distance metric and a sequence number. Any MPs hearing the portal announcement establish a path to the RP node by using PREQ and PREPbased path establishment primitives After constructing the path towards the RP, any MPs wishing to send data packets first ask the RP for MAC address of destination node through the pre-established path to the RP by using IPv6 neighbor solicitation \(NS\ message. The RP node hearing the IPv6 NS messa ge from any MP s sends back the response message \(i.e., neighbor advertisement\o the initiator node of the NS message. That is, the proposed proxy ND approach does not need any flooding delivery for neighbor discovery request and response messages in WLAN 1 000\003 Abstract

The existing schemes are assumed to adopt the basic neighbor discovery mechanism using multiple allnode broadcasting Fig. 2 shows the communication setup latency, i.e., the necessary time the first data packet was able to be transmitted successfully. In Fig. 2, thanks to the reduction of the number of flooding by using the pre-configured proxy neighbor table the proposed proxy ND scheme can achieve lower communication setup latency than the existing schemes. In the existing schemes, broadcasted PREQ packets contend with NS packets and therefore the broadcasted packets experience interference with each other. On the other hand, the proposed scheme mitigates mutual interference between neighbor discovery and path discovery as well as concurrent neighbor discoveries. Hence the network becomes more stable, and path discovery latency can be improved         Computer networks  mesh networks The operation of the proxy neighbor discovery approach is largely made of 3 steps. The detailed procedures are as follows Step 1. Path configuration towards RP: All MPs hearing the portal announcement message try to configure the path to the RP. For the path establishment towards the RP node, the ondemand path discovery method based on PREQ \(Path request and PREP \(Path reply\ primitives is utilized Step 2. Proxy registration: Each node in WLAN mesh networks sends a proxy registration message to the RP to announce its existence as well as its address binding information \(i.e., MAC address and IPv6 address\m the proxy registration, the RP configures the proxy neighbor table for the relation between MAC address and IPv6 address of each node. A non-mesh device first associates with MAP which is located within its service range, by using standard IEEE 802.11 procedures. Once associated, the MAP initiates a proxy registration procedure on behalf of the device towards the RP. The proxy registration utilizes the pre-established path towards the RP. To do so, it sends a proxy registration request PRReq\ message including MAC address and IPv6 address on behalf of the device, to the RP. The RP thereby learns that the device is being proxied by the MAP as well as MAC address and IPv6 address of the device. The RP may then create a proxy registration reply \(PRRep\ message which is sent towards the MAP. Once receiving PRRep, MAP configures a proxid address information for the device Step 3. Neighbor discovery request and response: When a device wants to send data packets to any other device, it first requests MAC address of the destination node to the RP using neighbor solicitation message if it has no information in its neighbor cache. On receiving the neighbor solicitation message, the RP looks up its proxy neighbor table and sends back the corresponding MAC address to the neighbor discovery initiator node using the neighbor advertisement message. After receiving NA message from the RP, the node can get the MAC address of the destination node and then starts to send data packets IV  Fig.2. Communication setup la tency as a function of the number of nodes   Fig. 3. Control message packets as a function of the number of nodes   In Fig. 3, as the number of nodes grows, the control overhead of existing schemes increases more sharply than that of the proposed scheme. This stems from the situation that the existing methods experience one or two times flooding due to NS delivery and PREQ delivery while the proposed method only utilizes unicast delivery for neighbor discovery request and response V C ONCLUSION This paper makes the following points. First, it shows that the difference between the application identifier \(i.e., IPv6 address\and routing identifier in WMN \(MAC address requires repeated flooding in the entire networks, and the multiple flooding may result in excessive redundancy contention, and collision. Second, it presents the proxy-based neighbor discovery method that minimizes network control overhead and reduces communication latency. Using the preconfigured proxy neighbor table, the proposed scheme can reduce the number of flooding delivery during the neighbor discovery process R EFERENCES  1 Standard for part 11, Wireless LAN medium access control \(MAC\ and physical layer \(PHY\specificatio ns, IEEE P802.11s/D1.08, IEEE, New York, NY 2 C.

Case 1: Healthy or Normal Condition and increasing Torque The motor is run under balanced three phase voltage and vibration data is collected for normal conditions, under noload and loaded conditions      Fig. 1. Vibration data obtained for healthy condition: no-load   Fig. 2. Variation of PSD’s for various scaling factors for Morlet CWT under no-load   The Bar graph shown in Fig. 2 indicates the PSD values for the no-load condition. There are slight variations in the value of PSD in one scale itself. So we are taking the average values, to take into account the variations that occur. We can see that, the wavelet has a good response to higher scales which was not there for the Debauchies family of wavelets This makes it a better choice for our analysis. The bar graphs obtained when DB10 was used is shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that, the PSD values at higher scales are very low, where changes do occur due to faults   Fig. 3. Variation of PSD’s for various scaling factors for DB10 under noload     Fig. 4  Variation of PSD’s for various scaling factors for Morlet CWT under heavy load  The bar graph in Fig. 4 shows the PSD values obtained under heavy load condition. It can be seen from Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 that the PSD at scaling level six increases with load From no-load to full load, this shows a linear rise in the value The average PSD values were found to rise from 4.933349 in no-load to 14.01358 for the full load condition. Even though other PSD values for other scaling factors do change, only the level six scaling and the corresponding PSD could act as the load indicator under healthy and faulty conditions Case 2: Single Phasing Condition and increasing Torque The electrical faults affect the lower order frequency ranges of the vibration data. Therefore, in the single phasing condition we expect a hike in the average PSD values in the higher scales. The fault was created by connecting a switch in one of the phases and opening it during motor running condition  Fig. 5  Variation of PSD’s for various scaling factors for Morlet CWT under single phasing no-load  From Fig. 5 and 7, it is clear that, a noticeable hike in PSD is there in the 50.78125-25.3906 Hz range. The average value was found to be 103.01 for the four sets of data, for no-load condition. For the loaded condition the values of PSD for scaling factors four and five were found to be excellent indicators of the fault. The average value of PSD at fourth scaling factor varied from 26.58916 to 44.89249 from no-load to higher loaded conditions. In normal condition it ranged from 18.66039 to 25.87709 only.  PSD at the fifth scaling was increasing with load, which is the reverse in case of healthy 


condition. Both of these with average PSD for ninth scaling factor \(for no-load\were found to be excellent indicators of the fault From Fig. 6, it is seen that the response of the DB10 wavelet to the vibration signal is not so pronounced at higher scales. Similar patterns were obtained for healthy condition and loose foundation bolts. No significant changes were noticed in the frequency bands were variations are expected for the faults considered here. The changes occurred in the 800-3200 Hz, which is not sufficient indicator for the fault   Fig. 6. Variation of PSD’s for various caling factors for DB10 under single phasing no-load  Fig. 7. Variation of PSD’s for various scaling factors for Morlet CWT under single phasing medium load  Case 3: Loose Foundation bolts and increasing Torque The machine was mounted on a strong foundation and directly loaded using dynamometers. The foundation bolts were loosened for the machine. The machine was run under unloaded and loaded conditions, and the vibrations were fetched. The vibration signal was logged and analyzed in the same way as it was done for all cases of healthy and single phasing condition. The supply voltage and the frequency were kept constant when the experiments were conducted The Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 indicate the value of PSD for different scales for light load and medium load condition. We can see that PSD for the fourth scaling factor has a high average value, which is a good indicator for the fault. Similar values were obtained for no-load to high load condition But, this classification may not be appropriate, since it causes an overlap with single phasing condition under light loads. Therefore, comparing with the normal case, we can say that it indicated a fault, but we can’t tell what the fault is exactly. Also the loose foundation bolts is a mechanical fault whose behavior will vary with the size or the moment of inertia of the machine. To improve the classification, we introduced the concept of selective weighting of PSD values using the spider web plots   Fig. 8.

Variation of PSD’s for various scaling factors for Morlet CWT under medium- load loose foundation   V  T HE SPIDER WEB PLOTS FOR THE PSD VALUES  A.

The resulting diagram looks much like a spider's web.

These lines are connected around the circle The angle between two such lines is 360/n, where n is the number of PSD values considered \(n=9 here\he plot looks much like a spider web. We are calculating the areas \(A1, A2 A3, A4 etc\ing one of the values as the common side of both the triangles. The two areas obtained are added to get the total area. This is done by keeping one of the PSD values as a common base of two triangles. Then area calculation is shifted clockwise to obtain other areas in similar manner. Depending on the magnitude of the PSD, there can be two types of triangles \(for eg. A1 and A2 or A3 and A4\For both categories of triangle, the formula for area calculation remains the same. The areas are calculated and tabulated     Fig. 10. Spider web plot construction  B. Analysis Results The areas obtained from the spider web plots had been compared. Eight areas from A1 to A8 were obtained for each case. The aim of doing this was to improve the classification of faults. The results show that, while comparing the healthy and the fault conditions, this method provides a better classification with minimum overlaps, under various torque values Table III shows the spider web areas obtained for single phasing and Table IV gives the areas obtained for loose foundation bolts for increasing loads. The A4 and A6 areas are consistently increasing and decreasing with load for healthy condition. For single phasing condition A4 is a very good indicator for its value rises very much with increase in load This value decreases in case of healthy condition\. In no load condition A4 has high values, as given in Table III In case of loose bolts \(Table IV\8 is a good indicator at no load and as load rises, value of A8 is found to be below the ranges seen elsewhere in any condition, except for one high load condition. It is seen that there is only a very small difference between indicators for no-load and heavy load in single phasing and loose foundation bolts. This overlap can be further minimized, if we use a higher HP motor for the mechanical fault. It is seen that the spider web method is much better than the PSD analysis for classification of faults  VI  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the methods for the online detection of Induction-motor faults based on wavelet based PSD analysis of the vibration data combined with spider web plots. The method is useful for effective online monitoring and diagnosis in industrial applications. The experiments performed and the results obtained show that wavelet based PSD analysis achieves better results in the field of fault diagnosis for every operating point of the induction motor. This, when combined with the selective weighting using spider web plots yields much better classification More investigation with no-load and variable load conditions may be done with different motors to make the results obtained more concrete. This method can be extended for monitoring cases of broken rotor bars, bearing damages etc. in the case of squirrel cage induction motors

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
