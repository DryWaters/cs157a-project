To overcome these limitations, we propose an\nalternative leveraging data locality through direct ?le transfers\nbetween the compute nodes. We rely on the observation that\nwork?ows generate a set of common data access patterns that\nour solution exploits in conjunction with context information\nto self-adapt, choose the most adequate transfer protocol and\nexpose the data layout within the virtual machines to the\nwork?ow engines. This ?le management system was integrated\nwithin the Microsoft Generic Worker work?ow engine and was\nvalidated using synthetic benchmarks and a real-life application\non the Azure cloud. The results show it can bring signi?cant\nperformance gains: up to 5x ?le transfer speedup compared\nto solutions based on standard cloud storage and over 25%\napplication timespan reduction compared to Hadoop on Azure.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA large class of scienti?c applications can be expressed\nas work?ows, which describe the relationship between indi-\nvidual computational tasks and their input and output data\nin a declarative way. To achieve rapid turnaround, work?ows\nrequire adequate infrastructures, like clouds, for a proper\nexecution. One missing link that limits a larger adoption of\nthese infrastructures is the data management, as clouds mainly\ntarget web and business applications, and lack speci?c support\nfor data-intensive scienti?c work?ows. Typically, a work?ow\nconsists of a set of loosely-coupled tasks linked via data- and\ncontrol-?ow dependencies. Unlike tightly-coupled applications\n\(e.g MPI-based large les.\nCurrently, the work?ow data handling in the clouds is\nachieved using either some application speci?c overlays that\nmap the output of one task to the input of another in a\npipeline fashion, or, more recently leveraging the MapReduce\nprogramming model \(e.g. Amazon Elastic MapReduce [1],\nHadoop on Azure - HDInsight 2 independent of any programming model.\nResearch into extensions of MapReduce attempt to bridge\nthese differences, taking inspiration from MPI, but they are\nlimited to iterative [3], [4] or distributed [5 versions that\ndon’t exploit the work?ow semantics. As each individual task\nruns on a separate virtual machine VM However, today’s reference\ncommercial clouds only provide object stores such as S3 or\nAzure Blobs accessed through high-latency HTTP interfaces,\nthat also require to change the way data is managed in order\nto adapt to the actual access method \(?les vs. objects  in\nthe cloud in order to exploit data locality. Nevertheless, most\n?le systems need special con?guration or handling to get them\nto work in a virtualized environment, while others cannot be\nexecuted at all, since they require kernel modi?cations not\nallowed by most cloud providers [7], [8].\nIn this paper, we speci?cally address these issues. We\nintroduce an approach for the ef?cient sharing and transfer\nof input/output ?les between the compute instances in the\ncloud. We advocate storing data on the compute nodes and\ntransferring les between them directly, in order to exploit data\nlocality and to avoid the overhead of interacting with a shared\n?le system. Under these circumstances, we propose a ?le man-\nagement service that enables high throughput through multiple\ntransfer strategies \(e.g. FTP-based, BitTorrent-based, etc implemented as dynamically loadable and\neasily extensible modules. Our proposal does not require any\nforeknowledge of the access pattern and dynamically adapts to\nthe work?ow context \(data size, format access, resource cost Generic Worker \(GW [9 follows:\n• We present an overview of the work?ow data man-\nagement issues on clouds \(Section II-C introduce an approach that optimizes the work?ow\ndata transfers on clouds by means of adaptive switch-\ning between several inter-VM ?le transfer protocols\nusing context information \(Sections III and IV an implementation of these design prin-\nciples in a ?le management system integrated within\nMicrosoft’s GW work?ow engine \(Section V the Windows Azure\ncloud in three different contexts: synthetic bench-\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 273\nFig. 1.

bio-informatics and a MapReduce\nprocessing \(Section VI the necessary background and elab-\norates on our observations that help motivate the cloud-based\nwork?ow data management research.\nA. The Need of Adaptive File Management for Work?ow\nProcessing on Clouds\nExecuting a scienti?c work?ow in the cloud involves\nmoving its tasks and ?les to the execution nodes [10], [11].\nThis data movement is critical for performance and costs\nsince when a task is assigned to an execution node, some of\nits required ?les may not be available locally. With the ?le\nsizes handled by scienti?c work?ows increasing to petabyte\nlevels, data handling becomes a bottleneck, impacting on the\nwork?ow’s makespan and costs. Thus properly scheduling the\ntasks according to the data layout within the compute VMs or\nplacing the data according to the computation pattern becomes\na necessity. In order to achieve this, a two-way communication\nbetween the work?ow engine and the data management system\nis required, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nB. Existing Data Management Solutions\nTraditional techniques commonly found in scienti?c com-\nputing \(e.g relying on parallel ?le systems architec-\ntures usually assume high-performance communication be-\ntween computation nodes and storage nodes e.g. PVFS [12],\nSector [13 much higher latencies between\ncompute resources and storage resources. Although a large\nnumber of network storage systems exist, few of them can\nbe deployed on clouds. Unlike our approach, most of them\nhandle data transfers statically and need special con?guration\nor handling to get them to work in a virtualized environment,\nwhile others cannot be executed at all, since they require kernel\nmodi?cations \(e.g. Lustre 14 leased resource are used.\nSeveral work?ow management systems were speci?cally\nproposed for scienti?c applications running on clouds. e-\nScience Central [10] enables non-programmer scientists to\nharness vast amounts of storage and compute power for\nrunning applications in batches without user interaction. Dryad\n[15 and Hadoop [16] allow for the distributed processing of\nlarge data sets across clusters of computers. However they\nall force scientists to adopt rigid programming models \(e.g.\nMapReduce, DAG based ?ows rely on high-\nlatency HTTP protocols, TCP pipes or shared memories for\nstatic data transfers. In contrast, our approach is independent\nof any programming interface and dynamically adapts to the\nexecution context. Pegasus 17] relies on a peer-to-peer ?le\nmanager similar to ours, when deployed on Amazon EC2.\nHowever, they use static transfers between the VMs and their\napproach is outperformed by a shared ?le-system.\nCloud based services, like Amazon’s CloudFront [18], use\nthe geographical distribution of data to reduce latencies of\ndata transfers. Similarly, [19] and [20] considered the problem\nof scheduling data-intensive work?ows in clouds assuming\nthat ?les are replicated in multiple execution sites. These ap-\nproaches can reduce the makespan of the work?ows but come\nat the cost and overhead of replication, which is considerable\nfor large datasets. In contrast, we don’t use multiple copies\nof data, but rather exploit the data access patterns to allow\nper ?le optimizations of transfers. Finally, several studies have\ninvestigated the performance of data management for real\nscience applications on clouds [21] [22], but with few excep-\ntions they have focused on tightly-coupled MPI applications or\nloosely-coupled MapReduce ones. Our work targets scienti?c\nwork?ows, with more general data interactions, non restricted\nto a speci?c programming model.\nC. File Transfer Support for Work?ow Management\nRequirements for cloud-based work?ows. In order to\nsupport data-intensive work?ows, a cloud-based solution needs\nto: 1 e.g. running in user’s virtualized space,\ncommodity compute nodes, ephemeral local storage to provide a reasonable time to solution; 3 accessed\nduring the execution.\nData management challenges. Data transfers are affected\nby the instability and the heterogeneity of the cloud net-\nwork. There are numerous options, some providing additional\nsecurity guarantees \(e.g. TLS e.g. BitTorrent minimize\nthe amount of data movement and to improve end-application\nperformance and scalability. Addressing data and computa-\ntional problems separately forces much data movement which\nwill not scale to tomorrow’s exascale datasets and millions\nof nodes, and will yield signi?cant underutilization of the\nresources. Metadata management plays an important role as,\ntypically, the data relevant for a certain task can be stored\nin multiple locations. Logical catalogs are one approach to\nproviding consistent information about the location of the data\nitems.\nProgramming challenges. So far, MapReduce has been\nthe ”de-facto” cloud computing model complemented by a\n274\nnumber of variations of languages for task speci?cation [23],\n[15]. They provide some data ?ow support, but all require\na shift of the application logic into the MapReduce model.\nWork?ow semantics go beyond the map-shuf?e-reduce-merge\noperations, and deal with data placement, sharing, inter-site\ndata transfers etc. Independently of the programming model\nof choice, be it MapReduce, scripting languages 


process\ndescriptions like BPEL or third party APIs, they all need to\naddress the following issues: support large-scale parallelism\nto maximize throughput under high concurrency, enable data\npartitioning to reduce latencies and handle the mapping from\ninput, intermediate and output data to cloud logical structures\nto ef?ciently exploit its resources.\nTargeted work?ow semantics. In order to address these\nchallenges we studied 27 real-life applications [24] from\nseveral domains \(bio-informatics, business logic, simulations\netc identi?ed a set of core-characteristics shared by a\nvast majority of them, which impact on the data management:\n• The common data patterns are: broadcast, pipeline,\ngather, reduce, scatter.\n• Work?ows are composed of batch jobs with well-\nde?ned data passing schemas. The work?ow engines\nexecute the batch jobs e.g. take the executable to a\nVM instance; bring the needed data ?les and libraries;\nrun the job and retrieve the ?nal result jobs are ?les,\nusually written once.\n• The batch jobs and their inputs and outputs can be\nuniquely identi?ed.\nOur focus is on how to ef?ciently handle and transfer\nwork?ow data between the VMs in a cloud deployment. We\nargue that keeping data in the local disks of the VMs is a\ngood option considering that for such work?ows, most of the\ndata ?les are usually temporary - they must exist only to be\npassed from the job that produced it to the one it will further\nprocess it. With our approach, the ?les from the virtual disk\nof each compute node are made available to all other nodes\nwithin the deployment. Caching the data where it is produced\nand transferring it directly where it is needed reduces the time\nfor data manipulation and minimizes the work?ow makespan.\nIII. OUR APPROACH: AN ADAPTIVE FILE MANAGEMENT\nSYSTEM\nA. Design overview\nOur proposal relies on four key design principles:\nExploiting the data locality. The cumulative storage\ncapacity of the VMs leased in one’s deployment easily reaches\nthe TBs order. Although batch jobs store their input and output\n?les on the local virtual disks, most of the storage capacity\nremains unused. Meanwhile, work?ows typically use remote\ncloud storage \(e.g. Amazon S3, Azure Blobs   This is costly\nand highly inef?cient, due to high latencies, especially for\ntemporary ?les that don’t require persistent storage. Instead,\nwe propose aggregating parts of the virtual disks in a shared\nFig. 2 Architecture of the File Management System. Operations for\ntransferring ?les between VMs: upload \(1 2,3,4 directly.\nStorage hierarchy. We advocate the use of a hierarchy for\nwork?ow data handling in the cloud comprising several layers:\nin-memory storage at the top, local disks, shared VM-based\nstorage and ?nally the remote cloud storage at the bottom. As\nmemory and storage devices move down the hierarchy they\nreduce in performance but tend to rise in capacity and costs. As\nopposed to a classical computer architecture, the costs tend to\nincrease towards the base of the hierarchy as the remote storage\ncomes at an extra-cost while the local resources are available\nfor free, from a storage perspective \(one has to pay only for\nthe compute cycles respectively,\nbased upon data access patterns, resource availability and user\nrequests.\nIntegrate multiple transfer methodologies. Adopting\nseveral ways to perform the ?le transfers, like peer-to-peer,\ndirect or parallel transfers, and dynamically choosing between\nthem at runtime based on context information allows to exploit\nwork?ow speci?c data access patterns. This also opens the\navenue for customization: users are able to easily add transfer\nmodules by implementing a simple API and by providing the\ntransfer method of their choice able to leverage the application\nsemantics.\nNo modi?cation of the cloud middleware. Data process-\ning in public clouds is done at user level, which restricts the\napplication permissions to the virtualized space. Our solution\nis suitable for both public and private clouds, as no additional\nprivileges are required.\nB Architecture\nThe simpli?ed schema of a distributed architecture that\nintegrates our approach is depicted in Figure 2. The input and\noutput ?les of the work?ow batch tasks are stored on the local\ndisks of the VMs. We introduce three components that enable\nsharing these ?les across the compute instances:\nThe Metadata Registry holds the ?le locations \(i.e. maps\n?les to VMs e.g name, user, sharing group etc the\ninformation required by the transfer module to retrieve the\n?le components within a Virtual Machine.\nthat holds a large number of small items \(the key-value pairs accessed by the VMs. In a general usage scenario,\na concurrency handling mechanism for writes/updates would\nbe needed for the Metadata Registry, usually provided at the\nexpense of performance. However, as discussed in Section\nII-C, in the context of ?le management for work?ow execution,\nthe ?les are produced and written by a single task and uniquely\nidenti?ed: there are no situations in which two tasks request\nthe Metadata Registry to publish the same new ?le. Therefore,\nthere is no need for strong veri?cation mechanisms \(e.g. global\nlocks global queries 


service on each\nVM. Applications \(e.g. work?ow engines simple API to perform ?le\nuploads and downloads. The upload operation is equivalent to\nsharing a ?le: the Transfer Manager will advertise it by creating\na record in the Metadata Registry. Hence, the cost of uploading\na ?le is O\(1 independent of the data size download operation has\ntwo phases: retrieving the ?le information from the Metadata\nRegistry and fetching the data from the VM holding it via the\nTransfer Manager on source VM. The main goal here is to\nminimize the number of read and write operations that need\nto be performed for passing a ?le from a task to another As\nseen in Figure 3, only one read and one write operation are\nneeded for such a direct transfer. Taking into consideration\nthat for transferring the ?les, multiple options are available,\nthis component is designed in a modular fashion such that\nit is easy to plug in different transfer back-ends \(i.e. libraries\ncorresponding to a data transfer technology selected.\nFigure 3 presents the components of the Transfer Manager\npresent in a VM. Essentially, the system is composed of\nuser deployed or default transfer modules and their service\ncounter parts, available on each compute instance. Clients\n\(e.g. work?ow engines les, via a cloud based API.\nThe Replication Agent is an optional component designed\nto balance the load of multiple accesses to a ?le through\nreplication. As such, it manages several replication strategies\nand policies within the ?le management system. The agent\nworks as a service that is started on each VM and commu-\nnicates via a queue-based messaging system. In addition to\nAlgorithm 1 The context-based transfer module selection\n1: procedure ADAPTIVETRANSFERMODULESELECTION\n2: JobDescription Client.getJobDescription module.ContextEvaluation\(JobDescription best score, score user defined threshold then\n8: TransferModule = BestModule;\n9: else\n10: TransferModule nDefaultAdaptiveModule TransferModule,\nJobDescription TransferModule;\n14: end procedure\nthe orchestration and the replication of ?les, the component\nhas the role of evaluating the gains brought by the replicas\nin each transfer context. These gains \(i.e. the transfer time\nreduction see Section IV determine the\nappropriate number of replicas for each context. The system\ncan be further extended to provide multiple replication schemes\nas discussed in [25], [26], by scheduling the replica placement\nin collaboration with the work?ow engine.\nIV. ZOOM ON THE ADAPTIVE WORKFLOW FILE\nTRANSFERS\nUsers can deploy their own transfer modules by means\nof a straightforward API. This requires to extend the transfer\nprotocol with an evaluation function for scoring the context.\nThe score is computed by aggregating a set of weighted context\nparameters e.g. number or size of ?les, replica count, resource\nload, data format etc relevance\nof the current transfer module for each speci?c parameter \(e.g.\na fast memory-to-memory data transfer protocol will favor\ntransfers of many small ?les through higher weights for these\nparameters module with the best score is chosen for\neach transfer, as shown in Algorithm 1. If no user modules are\ndeployed or none of them ?ts the work?ow context, a Default\nAdaptive Module that we provide is chosen.\nThe default module selection strategy that we provide is\npresented in Algorithm 2. This uses a set of parameters de?ned\nby users in an XML ?le \(e.g. size limits of ?les to be ?tted in\nmemory, replicas count, etc selection is done based on\nweights assigned to these parameters, that de?ne the transfer\ncontext. The importance of each parameter is rated by both\nclients \(e.g. work?ow engines The\nlatter can in fact modify the transfer context by increasing the\nnumber of replicas if the transfer speedup obtained comes at a\ncost that ?ts the budget constraints. Currently, the selection is\ndone between 3 transfer protocols that we provide within our\nframework:\n• In-Memory: for small ?les or for situations in which\nthe leased infrastructure has enough memory capacity,\nkeeping data in the memory across VMs becomes\ninteresting. This provides one of the fastest methods\n276\nAlgorithm 2 The default parameterized module for a weighted\ntransfer selection\n1: procedure DEFAULTADAPTIVEMODULE\n2 ReadAdaptiveParameters\(UserDefinedParams XML the\nReplication Agent based on the budget\n3: \(cl size weight, cl replica weight nClient.getRecomandedScore re size weight, re replica weight user def cost ratio Replicator.updateContextForSpeedup\(\nJobDescription, user def cost ratio threshold context based on ?le size and\nreplicas count\n8: if JobDescription.Output.Size × \(cl size weight\n+re size weight cl replica weight\n+re replica weight 


DirectLinkModule;\n14: end if\n15: end if\n16: end procedure\nto handle it, boosting the performance especially for\nscatter and gather/reduce data access patterns. A per-\ncentage of the VM memory will be dedicated to the\nshared memory system, which can reach an aggregated\ncapacity in the order of GBs, from all the nodes.\n FTP: for large ?les, that need to be transferred from\none machine to another, direct TCP-transfers are priv-\nileged. FTP seems a natural choice for interoperability\nreasons. The data access patterns that bene?t most\nfrom this approach are pipeline and gather/reduce.\n• BitTorrent: for data patterns like broadcast multicast\nor scatter, having multiple replicas enables a through-\nput increase and a load balance as clients collaborate\nin retrieving the data. Thus, for scenarios involving\nreplication \(above a user de?ned threshold of large\ndatasets, we rely on BitTorrent. These gains in per-\nformance can be enhanced for time critical transfers\nor for ?les that are highly accessed by increasing the\nnumber of replicas at the expense of the extra storage\nspace that the replicas occupy.\nDiscussion: the cost of data dissemination. As replication\nhas a direct impact on the transfer performance, we propose a\ncost model that gives hints on how to adapt the replicas count\nwith respect to transfer speedup. We start by associating a cost\nfor storing data on a VM disk Although there is no additional\ncost for the local virtual disks, the storage capacity is limited\nto several hundreds GBs depending on the VM type. We de?ne\nthis cost as the ratio between the capacity of the VM disk and\nits cost: costMB = VM PricingLocal Disk Capacity . Then, the cost of\nhaving NR replicas, each having Size MB, is costReplicas =\nNR ?Size?costMB . Next, we examine the time gain obtained\nfrom each replica. We assume a linear function starting from\none replica, which implies a transfer time of timetransfer =\nSize\nThroughput down to a transfer time of 0, when there is a\nreplica on all nodes \(NR = NNodes next\nfunction de?ning the gained time:\ntimegain =\nSize\nThroughput\n? \(1? NNodes ?NR\nNNodes ? 1 0 for one replica up to timetransfer, when data\nis already present and no transfer is needed. Hence, we are able\nto associate a cost for speeding-up the data dissemination as\nthe ratio timegaincostReplicas . The Default Adaptive Module integrates\nthis model within the Replication Agent, using a distributed,\nqueue-based replication service, in order to dynamically adjust\nthe number of replicas. Users can de?ne a certain cost that\nthey are willing to pay for speeding the transfer, as a ratio\nparameter \(i.e. user def cost ratio threshold i.e. size, transfer throughput can scale the replicas in the system and\nchoose one transfer module over another in order to decrease\nthe transfer time within the cost boundaries imposed by the\nextra storage space used, as shown in Algorithm 2.\nV IMPLEMENTATION\nWe implemented a prototype of the ?le management sys-\ntem and integrated it within the Microsoft Generic Worker\nwork?ow engine, by replacing its default data storage backend,\nwhich relied on Azure Blobs. Using the provided API, the\ninformation about the tasks’ ?les is passed from the GW task\nmanager to our system. As future work, the task scheduler of\nthe GW will be extended, in order to use the data locality\ninformation that our solution provides. The GW engine was\nchosen, as it facilitates the process of porting existing science\napplications to clouds \(in particular, Azure minimal effort and predictable cost-\neffective performance. While the system is optimized for\nAzure, it can be easily extended to other cloud technologies.\nThe GW supports this generalization through a set of pluggable\ncomponents with standardized interfaces that allow a simple\nmigration to other clouds, only by replacing the runtime\ncomponent.\nThe Metadata Registry has to ef?ciently support a large\nset of small key-value pairs. The service must be distributed\nand reachable from all the node instances. Several implemen-\ntation alternatives cope with these requirements: in-memory\ndatabases, Azure Tables, Azure Caching 27]. We chose the\nlatter as it easily allows a percentage of the VM’s memory to\nbe dedicated to caching Depending on the leased resources,\nthe VM memory can reach capacities in the order of GBs,\nmaking it viable for data sharing. Our preliminary evaluations\nshow that the Azure Caching delivers better performances than\nthe Azure Tables \(10 times faster for small items unlike a database Transfer Manager needs to support the seamless\nintegration of new, user de?ned, transfer methods. To achieve\nthis, we opted for the Management Extensibility Framework\n[28], which allows the creation of lightweight extensible ap-\nplications. The default in-memory module is based also on the\nAzure Caching system The FTP module relies on an open\nsource library [29], tuned to harness the cloud speci?cities:\n277\nas a deployment is virtually isolated, authentication between\nthe nodes is redundant, so it was removed; the chunk size\nof data read/written to the TCP connection was increased to\n1 MB for a higher throughput. The BitTorrent module uses\nMonoTorrent [30], an open source protocol implementation.\nIn a typical scenario with multiple peers sharing data across\nwide area networks, the default packet size is set to 16 KB.\nHowever, our initial experiments showed that this chunk size\nis too small for transfers between nodes within a data center.\nAfter experimenting with varying chunk sizes \(up to 16 MB 


to\n5 times. For distributing the load, trackers are started within\neach VM, at which the peers \(i.e. the Transfer Managers using\nthe torrent module seeder discovery.\nThe Replication Agent is implemented as a service that\nruns as a background process in the cloud VMs and provides\ntwo functions. On the one hand, each agent acts as a worker\npolling for jobs, that specify the ?les to replicate. For job\ncommunication between agents, a message passing schema\nover the Azure Queue was built. On the other hand, the Repli-\ncation Agent implements the space/cost/performance strategy\ndescribed in Section IV to create the appropriate number of\nreplicas. This is done by creating replication jobs that are\nassigned to the other agents in the system, which transfer the\ndata when the network bandwidth of the corresponding VM is\nnot saturated by the Transfer Manager.\nVI. EVALUATION\nIn this section we evaluate our approach both in synthetic\nand real-life settings. Our experimental setup consists of 50\nMedium nodes \(2 CPU cores, 3.5 GB memory, 490GB local\ndisk data\ncenters. We analyze the ?le transfer times of our default mod-\nules and their impact on the makespan of a real-life application,\ncompared to the usage of a shared cloud storage service \(Azure\nBlobs [6 MapReduce framework \(HDInsight - Hadoop\non Azure[2 analyze the adaptive pa-\nrameters of our solution in order to better understand its\nbehavior and the different trade-offs involved. To this end, we\nimplemented a simple benchmarking work?ow \(Figure 4 two data access patterns \(broadcast and pipeline\nwithin a reduction tree 38\ndistributed identical jobs, with 20 of them on the ?rst tree\nlayer. Each job takes 2 input ?les containing numbers, applies\nseveral mathematical operations and then stores the result in an\noutput ?le, used by the tasks on the next layers. Additionally,\n2 other jobs \(the ones in the left in Figure 4 for\nstaging-in the initial input ?les.\nScenario 1: Small ?les, no replication. This scenario\nis useful to determine the threshold up to which the in-\nmemory transfer is ef?cient for cloud VMs. Figure 5 presents\nthe average time of a job manipulating 2 input and one\noutput ?le with different sharing solutions. Not surprisingly,\nmanaging the ?les inside the deployment reduces the transfer\ntimes up to a factor of 4, compared to the remote shared\nFig. 4. Work?ow schema for the synthetic benchmark.\nFig. 5. Average transfer time per job when 2 input ?les are downloaded and\none is uploaded\ncloud storage \(Azure Blobs of\nour transfer modules by eliminating the time series for the\nAzure Blobs in Figures 6 and 7, which depict the transfer\ntimes for downloading / uploading ?les for the jobs of the\nsynthetic work?ow. We notice that for small ?les, the in-\nmemory solution delivers the best results. With increasing\nsizes, transferring ?les directly becomes more ef?cient, as the\nin-memory module must handle more fragments - the ?les are\nfragmented/defragmented into 4 MB chunks \(the maximum\nsize of an object in Azure Cache retrieving\nmore fragments leads to increasing performance variations,\nwhich should be avoided as scienti?c applications require\npredictable performance [31]. Based on these, we retain a\nthreshold of 15 MB for the size of the ?les shared in-memory.\nThe torrent module pays the price of an extra operation for\nhashing the ?le and generating the ”.torrent” metadata, used\nby peers for download, which makes it inef?cient for small\nnon-replicated ?les. We note that the upload time is O\(1 the registration of the\n?le to the Metadata Registry. However, in memory-based write\noperations are O\(n all fragments must be written in the\nmemory, giving another argument for bounding the maximum\n?le size of such transfers.\nScenario 2: Medium to large ?les, replication enabled.\nNext, we evaluate the impact of our approach in an unfavorable\nscenario: sharing large ?les, replicated across the cloud infras-\ntructure. The stage-in jobs \(the ones in the left of Figure 4 Azure Blobs the number of replicas is automatically set\nto 3 and the ?les are transparently distributed within the storage\nservice. We notice from Figure 8 that our adaptive solution\n\(dynamically switching between transfer methods compared to a static ?le handling \(within the\ndeployment remote storage less\nthan 1 second time\nto download the 2 input ?les, when increasing their sizes. With\nmultiple seeders for the replicas, the torrent-based module is\nmore ef?cient. In the broadcast phase of the work?ow, torrents\nperform better, while in the reduction phase, direct link will\nwork better for the pipeline transfers. Our adaptive solution\nexploits these patterns and switches in real-time between these\ntwo modules.\nScenario 3: MapReduce processing, Word Count. This\nthird set of experiments considers a typical MapReduce pro-\ncessing in order to assess whether a general purpose work?ow\nengine enhanced with our ?le management scheme can meet\nthe performance of a dedicated MapReduce engine.

In fact HDFS performs\nthe data manipulation locally, within the compute nodes, which\nimplies that at least half of the gain comes from the adaptive\nbehavior, while the remaining would come from replacing\nHDFS.\nB. Case study BLAST - a bio-informatics application\nOur next series of experiments focuses on real-life scienti?c\napplications. We illustrate the bene?ts of our approach for\none such application: BLAST, a work?ow for comparing\nprimary biological sequences to identify those that resemble\nabove a certain threshold. BLAST is representative of a large\nclass of scienti?c work?ows that split their initial data into\nsub-domains which are analysed in parallel, iteratively. The\nBLAST work?ow is composed of 3 types of batch jobs. A\nsplitter partitions the input ?le \(up to 800MB in our exper-\niments BLAST\njobs.

When we isolate the\n?le handling times, we observe that these are reduced to half\nper job with the adaptive solution.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nCurrently, clouds rely on network overlays and MapReduce\nstyle processing for work?ow data handling. This paper pro-\nposes a cloud-based alternative: a ?le management service,\nintegrated within Microsoft’s Generic Worker, that enables\nef?cient ?le transfers directly between the compute nodes. Our\napproach is highly adaptive and can choose between several\ndynamically loadable transfer modules the most suited for a\nspeci?c data movement. It does not require any past trace of\nthe transfer, but rather relies on context data \(resource status,\ndata size and format etc access pattern.\nThis solution brings a transfer speed-up of up to a factor\nof 5 compared to using the default cloud storage, while the\nexecution time of the applications is reduced with 25 % when\ncompared to Hadoop on Azure.\nFig. 12. The BLAST work?ow makespan: the compute time is the same\n\(marked by the horizontal line remaining time is the data handling\nFig. 13. Average times for staging data in and out for a Blast job when the\nnumber of jobs is increased\nThanks to these encouraging results, we plan to further\ninvestigate the potential bene?ts of exploiting the description\nof the entire workload, if available, when scheduling the le\ntransfers. In particular, we see a good potential to reduce the\ntransfer decision overhead by means of predictions and plan to\ninvestigate this issue more closely. Furthermore, an interesting\ndirection to explore is the closer integration between the\nwork?ow engine and the ?le system deployed on the compute\nnodes, in order to exploit data placement hints for ?le transfers.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by the joint INRIA - Microsoft\nResearch Center.

stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
