We also propose a two-phased mining algorithm to discover high transaction-weighted utility itemsets. The experimental results on synthetic datasets show the proposed approach has a good performance Keywords: data mining; utility mining; two-phase mining high utility itemsets; high transaction-weighted utility itemsets I   I NTRODUCTION  Mining association rules [1 s an i m p o r tan t is su e i n th e  field of data mining due to its wide applications. Traditional association rules are, however, derived from frequent itemsets, which only consider the occurrence of items but do not reflect any other factors, such as price or profit. Chan et al thus proposed the utility mining to solve the problem They considered both individual profits and quantities of products \(items\ transactions, and used them to find out actual utility values of itemsets. Several other researches about utility mining were proposed in these years      17 18 1 9  Weighted mining has recently been proposed, in which transactions are attached with weighted values according to some criteria [3   13 1 6]. It i s i m p o r t a n t  be ca use i f  the same significance is assumed for all the transactions in a database, some interesting association rules may not be found by traditional mining. However, the actual significance of an itemset cannot be easily recognized In this study, we thus consider transaction weights and introduce a new kind of patterns, called high transactionweighted utility itemsets. The proposed patterns consider not only individual profits and quantities of products in transactions but also utility contribution of transactions in a database. Moreover, a two-phased mining algorithm is also proposed for effectively and efficiently finding the high transaction-weighted utility itemsets from a transactional database The mining process of the proposed algorithm can be divided into two phases. In the first phase, the possible candidate transaction-weighted utility itemsets are found level by level. In the second phase, the candidate transaction-weighted utility itemsets are further checked for their actual utility values by an additional database scan Finally, the itemsets with their actual weighted-utility values larger than or equal to a predefined threshold are output as the high transaction-weighted utility itemsets. The experimental results on synthetic datasets also show the good performance of the proposed approach  II  R ELATED W ORKS  In this section, some related researches are briefly reviewed. They are utility mining and weighted associationrule mining A  Utility Mining In association-rule mining, only binary itemsets are considered. However, products bought in transactions may contain profits and quantities in real-world applications Especially, some high-profit products may occur with low frequencies in a database. The high-profit but low-frequency itemsets may not be found in traditional association-rule mining approaches Chan et al thus proposed utility mining to discover high utility itemsets [4 T h e y co n s id ered n o t o n l y th e q u an t itie s of the items in a product combination but also their profits Formally, local transaction utility and external utility are used to measure the utility of an item. The local transaction utility of an item is directly obtained from the information stored in a transaction dataset, like the quantity of the item sold in a transaction. The external utility of an item is given by users, like its profit Liu et al then proposed a two-phased algorithm to discover high utility itemsets from a database by adopting the downward-closure property  T h e y n a m e d t h e i r approach as the transaction-weighted-utilization TWU  model. It used the whole utility of a transaction as the upper bound of an itemset in that transaction to keep the downward-closure property. It consisted of two phases. In phase 1, the model found out possible candidate itemsets from a database. In phase 2, the database was rescanned again to update the actual utility of the possible candidate itemsets and found the ones with their actual utility values larger than or equal to a predefined threshold \(called the

Several other algorithms for utility mining were also proposed [6 7 7  1 8   1 9   an d  some related studies are still in progress [5 5    B  Weighted Association-Rule Mining Weighted association-rule mining [3  12 13 16  i s  concerned with the analysis of significance of items or transactions in a set of data. It is proposed to find out different kinds of interesting patterns from a set of data with item weight or transaction weight. The weights in these approaches may be thought of as an extension of traditional support in association-rule mining. Weighted association rules can be discovered in a variety of forms, like weighted association rules, fuzzy weighted association rules, and weighted utility association rules Lu et al proposed a new mixed weighted mining model  fi n d i ng w e i ght e d  a ssoc i a t i o n  r u l e s fro m a s e t  o f  d a t a   The weighted rules might provide more useful and interesting information to decision makers in many applications such as retail marketing, data stream, medical data analysis, and among others Khan et al then discovered weighted utility association rules from a database by considering both quantities of items sold in a single transaction and weight values of items given by experts [10  In th ei r m odel  th e t r an s acti o n w e ig h t ed  utility measure is used to find out all weighted utility association rules from a set of data. However, the model did not consider the actual utility of itemsets in a database. If we consider both the actual utility of itemsets and the weight values of transactions in a database, we may find out different interesting patterns. In this paper, both utility contribution of itemsets and transactions are thus considered instead of only one perspective of transactions in the weighted utility association rule model  III  T HE P ROPOSED M INING A LGORITHM  A  The proposed algorithm for finding high transactionweighted utility itemsets The proposed algorithm for finding high transactionweighted utility itemsets can be divided into two phases Phase 1 first finds all the possible candidate transactionweighted utility itemsets from a database.

This is a simple example to show how the proposed algorithm can be easily used to find out the high transaction-weighted utility itemsets from a set of transactions. Assume the ten transactions shown in TABLE I are used for mining. Each transaction consists of two features, transaction identification TID d items purchased. There are four items in the database, respectively denoted A to D The value attached to each item is the quantity sold in the transaction TABLE I   T HE SET OF TEN TRANSACTIONS IN THIS EXAMPLE  TID A B C D Trans 1  1 0 1 14 Trans 2  0 0 6 0 Trans 3  1 0 2 4 Trans 4  0 1 4 0 Trans 5  0 0 3 1 Trans  6  0 0 1 13 Trans  7  0 0 8 0 Trans 8  4 0 0 7 Trans 9  0 1 1 10 Trans 10  0 1 0 18  Also assume that the predefined profit value for each single item is defined in TABLE II TABLE II  T HE PREDEFINED PROFIT VALUES OF THE ITEMS  Item Profit A 1 B 10 C 6 D 3  In this example, the transaction-weighted utility values of itemsets C  D  BD and CD are larger than or equal to 002 according to the processing way of the proposed algorithm. They are thus put into the set of high transactionweighted utility itemsets HTWUI as shown in TABLE III TABLE III  H IGH TRANSACTION WEIGHTED UTILITY ITEMSETS  High Transaction Weighted Utility Itemset Transaction Weighted Utility C 9.20 D 14.79 BD 9.20 CD 10.97  In this example, four high transaction-weighted utility itemsets are generated. Note that if the traditional utility mining way is used, the results will be C  D and CD  The proposed algorithm based on the transaction-weighted utility concept can discover more unknown utility itemsets from a set of high-utility transactions in a transactional database. For example, the itemset BD is a high utility itemset in the high-utility transactions such as transactions 1 6, 7, 9 and 10. But the itemset BD cannot be discovered by using traditional utility mining Under the perspective of the transaction-weighted utility utility contribution of itemsets in the high-utility transactions will be more noticeable with the increase of influence degree of transaction utility. The item combination in a high transaction-weighted utility itemset can thus really show different information against the traditional high utility itemsets  V  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  A series of experiments was conducted to compare the effects of the traditional and the proposed high utility patterns and to evaluate the performance of the proposed mining algorithm with different parameter values. The experiments were implemented in J2SDK 1.5.0 and executed on a PC with 3.0 GHz CPU and 1GB memory The public IBM data generator was first used in our experiments w e v e r, s i n ce ou r obj ectiv e w a s to  discover high utility itemsets, we also developed a simulation model, which was similar to that used in [11 to  generate the quantities of the items in the transactions. Each

quantity ranged among 1 to 5 according to the way in Moreover, for each dataset generated, a corresponding utility table was also generated in which a profit value lying among 0.01 to 10.00 was randomly assigned to an item Figure 1 shows the profit value distribution of all the items generated by the simulation model in the utility table   Figure 1  The profit value distribution in the synthetic data set In the experimental evaluation, the used parameters T  I  N and D represented the average length of items per transaction, the average length of maximal potentially frequent itemsets, the total number of different items, and the total number of transactions, respectively Experiments were made on the synthetic dataset T10I4N4KD200K to evaluate the difference rate between traditional high utility itemsets and high transactionweighted utility itemsets. The experimental results for different minimum weighted-utility thresholds are shown in Figure 2   Figure 2  The difference rate between two kinds of patterns under different minimum weighted-utility thresholds It could be observed from the figure that the difference rate between the two kinds of patterns varied along with different minimum weighted-utility thresholds. The obvious difference rates between the two kinds of patterns were achieved. It could be explained as follows. In the traditional utility mining model, it only considers actual utility of itemsets but not significance of transaction utility. It may lose some unknown high utility itemsets in a set of highutility transactions. But those unknown high utility itemsets existing in a set of high-utility transactions may be easier to be found by our proposed algorithm. The difference rate between the traditional high utility itemsets and the described high transaction-weighted utility itemsets was thus very obvious under the same parameter settings Experiments were at last made to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed mining algorithm TP-HTWUI igure 3 showed the execution time on the T10I4N4KD200K dataset for different thresholds varying from 0.10% to 0.02%. It could be easily observed that the execution time of the proposed mining algorithm increased along with the increase of the threshold value   Figure 3  The execution time under different thresholds VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we have proposed a new kind of patterns called the high transaction-weighted utility itemsets, which consider the transaction utility significance of each of the transactions in a database. Moreover, we have also proposed the two-phased mining algorithm to effectively and efficiently discover the described patterns from a transactional database. The experimental results show that the proposed high transaction-weighted utility patterns have a good effect from high-utility transactions in a database when compared to the traditional utility patterns. In the future, we would apply the proposed knowledge type and approach to some practical applications, such as supermarket promotion applications R EFERENCES  1  R. Agrawal and R.

Capacity for analysis and synthesis, Research skills Capacity to learn 4   Interpersonal skills Leadership, Interpersonal skills, Ability to communicate with non-experts, Oral and written communications in native language, Critical and self-critical capability, Teamworking 5   Personal skills Ability to work autonomously Problem solving, Capacity to adapt to new situations Knowledge of a second language, Concern for quality, Will to succeed, Elementary computing skills, Capacity for applying knowledge in practice Decision making, Project design and management Information management skills Table 7 shows the mean importance of each gr oup of competences by stakeholder group for the First Cycle Degree respondents. For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is Problem solving. Second in the ranking for students is Elementary computing skills. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second language and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with Personal skills rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by Professional skills, Interpersonal skills, Internationalisation and Entrepreneurship. The smallest mean Internationalisation is just over midway between weak and considerable. Given the European Unions desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by Personal sk ills and Interpersonal skills. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently. This difference has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn. The general unevenness in ranking reflects different perspectives and is, in itself not considered a major issue, of concern are the relative positions of competences and the relative gaps. In general and even allowing for this employers and academics tend to rate competences higher in importance than students and graduates a number of specific instances of differences are drawn out in section 8 73
