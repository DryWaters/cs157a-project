Platform Independent GUI for Reconfigurable Ultrasonic System-on-Chip Hardware  Clementine Boulet, Eric Rovira Ricard, Spenser Gilliland, Thomas Gonnot and Jafar Saniie Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering  Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A   Abstract\227Ultrasonic systems are widely used in industrial and medical imaging applications for diagnosis, nondestructive evaluation \(NDE\ defect recognition and classification. These applications are big data problems that must be processed in real-time using computationally intensive signal processing algorithms. The Reconfigurable Ultrasonic System-on-Chip Hardware \(RUSH\ platform, developed for this study, utilizes hardware/software co-design to allow flexibility in system development for these real-time ultrasonic signal processing applications. In this paper, a Graphical User Interface \(GUI\s designed for the RUSH platform which allows users to visualize and capture ultrasonic signals in one, two and three dimensions Furthermore, a TCP based platform-independent client-server protocol has been established for communication between the RUSH system and the user Keywords\227ultrasounds; graphical user interface \(GUI\; C Qt; QWT; OpenGL  I  I NTRODUCTION  Ultrasonic nondestructive signals have been widely used to determine properties of materials by sending an ultrasonic pulse through it and analyzing the measured reflections. When the pulse reaches a discontinuity within or between materials e.g. a transition from water to metal or conversely, the wave is partially reflected back, creating an echo. Moreover, if a flaw is present in the object, then the retrieved signal will present additional echoes corresponding to the defects of the material By analyzing various parameters of these echoes we can deduce the physical properties of the defects. In our application, we essentially detect the material properties of an object by resorting to the ultrasonic measurements. Our ultrasonic measurement system is composed of a transducer that sends ultrasonic signals into a water tank that contain a submerged object for testing and inspection. The system is designed to concurrently process an ultrasonic range of waves from 20 KHz to 20 MHz The retrieved signal, which is a collection of echoes, is forwarded to the Reconfigurable Ultrasonic System-on-Chip Hardware \(RUSH\ platform. This platform is designed to be an easy-to-use extensible System-on-Chip \(SoC\ for developing low power, inexpensive, real-time processing algorithms. It relies on existing standards for signal analysis and image processing [1 Th e R U SH pla t f o rm is a com b in ati o n of  firmware and software using reconfigurable FPGA, specifically designed for processing ultrasonic signals and providing internet access for remote inspections The ultrasonic measurements can be performed in three different scanning approaches: A-scan, B-scan and C-scan. An A-scan is a one-dimensional measurement, oriented in the depth direction \(following the z-axis\. A B-scan is a two dimensional capture, and thus a collection of A-scans following the y-axis. With the same logic, a C-scan \(Constant depth scan\s generated from a three-dimensional measurement, as a collection of B-scan following the x-axis The major components of the RUSH platform are the Xilinx FPGA and the embedded microprocessor within the FPGA. The modular design structure of this platform can be easily upgraded with the latest high-performance FPGA devices as they become available. The system use Xilinx Embedded Development Kit \(EDK\here the major feature of this EDK tool suite is the integration of the Microblaze processor, capable of running a Linux based operating system All these tools allow the reuse of substantial portion of available software and drivers, such as TCP/IP protocol or IP cores. Especially, the RUSH system is theoretically capable of providing wired gigabit Ethernet communication at 125 MB/s Discrete Wavelet Transform \(DWT\ one of the most efficient methods for compressing ultrasonic data and thus has been selected to process the retrieved RUSH data[2   T h e d ata  is oversampled to retain very fine features of the ultrasonic signal. Each A-scan is a sample of 2048 points, a B-Scan is a sample of 128 A-scans taken per line along the y-axis Similarly, C-Scans are obtained by taking B-scans on 128 lines along the x-axis. 3D ultrasonic data compression is carried out by applying 1D-DWT for z, y, and x coordinates As an A-scan has significant amount of redundant information due to oversampling, in order to extensively reduce the size of A-scans, a high-order wavelet, Daubechies10 \(db10\ is used to compress the signal in the z-direction Using the Haar wavelet, some redundancies can be removed by detecting high correlations between neighboring A-scans in the y and x directions. Thus a compression of 79% in z-direction has been achieved, and in the combined y and x directions an additional 75% reduction of the compressed results [3   978-1-4799-4774-4/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 298 


II  I MPLEMENTATION  This section describes the means and the concepts used for implementing the RUSH interface A  Development Tools Three major development tools have been used to built this interface: Qt and its Integrated Development Environment IDE\d OpenGL [4-6   Qt is a Cross-Platform application framework, widely used for developing software with a graphical user interface, and for non-GUI programs such as command-line tools and consoles for servers. The cross-platform feature is an asset to develop and run this GUI regardless of the operating system, desktop platforms \(Linux, Mac and Windows\, and  mobile platforms Android and iOS\ Non-GUI features include network support and a unified cross-platform Application Programming Interface \(API\or file handling. In addition, the capability of Qt to support third-party plugins has been used in this project Qt Creator is a cross-platform IDE using C++, conceived to support Qt libraries natively. This IDE has been used to develop the RUSH Client and server and design the GUI QWT is a C++ based third party library and a graphics extension for Qt. This library contains GUI components and utility classes, which are primarily useful for programs with a technical or scientific background. QWT has been used in this project, given that it provides a framework for 1D and 2D plots as well as different layouts \(scales, sliders, etc\ in order to control and display values, arrays, or ranges of type double QWT is distributed under an open-source license. Its usage is very diverse, from curve plots to histograms. It is regularly updated to ensure compatibility with the latest Qt version OpenGL \(Open Graphics Library\ is a cross-language multi-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D computer graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a Graphics Processing Unit \(GPU\, to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering. In this project, this library has been used as a third party library extension for Qt, in order to render 3D graphics B  Implementation Approach 1  TCP/IP Model The communication between the server and the client is based on TCP/IP, to take advantage of the benefits of using an international standard for communications that runs on most LANs, but also over the Internet. TCP/IP has been chosen over UDP in this project, given that TCP ensures packet retransmissions. We seek data consistency during the transmission, regardless of a possible packet delay introduced during retransmissions. As a layered communication model we have focused on developing the higher layer \(application layer\d taken advantage of Qt libraries to implement the lower layers, as illustrated in Fig. 1 Fundamentally, the application layer of the RUSH client and server turns a message into a bit stream that is sent to the TCP transport layer by creating a data block. As soon as the information reaches the other side of the connection in the TCP buffer, a signal is transmitted. The size of the message is first retrieved and a subroutine is run to wait until the receiver gets the complete data block. Then this block is processed in order to extract the needed information  Fig. 1  TCP/IP model used for the RUSH platform 2  Data Serialization of the RUSH application layer For every transmission or every message, a data block is created. This block is composed of any type of C++ variables to be sent. The block is serialized as a bit stream using Qt libraries, and provided to the TCP/IP transport layer [1   T o d o  this, when a data block is created, its size \(in bytes\ is appended at the top of the block. In this way, as soon as the receiver starts receiving the data block, it first retrieves the size of the block, and then, it waits for remaining bytes to be received C  Software Structure 1  Server and Client Interaction   Fig. 2  RUSH GUI State Diagram  299 


The state diagram in Fig. 2 shows the design of the ClientServer interaction. The client, starting at the Disconnected  state, follows this state diagram and the server provides the client with the information corresponding to its requests The client connects to the server using a username, a password, an IP address and a port. Multiple users can connect to the server simultaneously. Once connected and authenticated, the server sends all the specific FPGA parameters  from the specific SoC, where the server software is running \(dynamic parameters\. Then, the client stays in the Online state, waiting for the user to load, save, or delete sessions, or to request an ultrasonic data capture. Sessions are a set of configuration values, corresponding to system-specific dynamic parameters 2  Dynamic Parameters As it has just been mentioned, the RUSH GUI retrieves the available FPGA parameters defined in the server \(on RUSH SoC\. This feature introduces the following main advantages 200  The same GUI can be connected to different SoC systems, regardless of their specifics parameters 200  The convenience for upgradeability and scalability is dramatically improved, given that adding a new SoC will not require updating the GUI in every user device For convenience, dynamic parameters can be defined by the developer, in a single C++ class, which has to be adapted to the specific SoC drivers. Anything else in the software requires further modifications III  GUI  F EATURES  Fig. 3, 4, 5 and 6 show the GUI features once the user has succesfully connected and authenticated to the server \(RUSH SoC\. The following sections introduce the main features developed in the GUI A  Dynamic Parameters and Sessions The dynamic parameters, corresponding to the specific RUSH SoC, are presented to the user in the lower left part of the GUI window, in tabs. In this case, there are 2 tabs: Scanner and Coordinates. The user can set values for the presented parameters, and save them as a session. In the same way, one can retrieve or delete a set of parameter values by just choosing the desired session name. To activate the current dynamic parameter values into the FPGA, the user has to click Update Parameters The buttons Delete  Save and Update Parameters  are enabled only if the user is authenticated as an administrator Otherwise, the user is only allowed to load sessions and request captures. The visualization options are performed locally and are independent of the communication with the RUSH SoC Therefore, we have decided to make them manageable by both administrator and non-administrator users B  A-Scan When an A-Scan is captured, a one-dimensional plot is created and displayed using QWT libraries, as shown in Fig. 3 The user is presented with zoom features, so he or she can better focus on a specific region of the signal. The user can choose to display the original signal or to display its absolute value, checking the option Modulus This option can be sometimes more convenient to identify ultrasonic flaws  Fig. 3  RUSH GUI displaying an A-Scan C  B-Scan  Fig. 4  RUSH GUI displaying a B-Scan When a B-Scan is captured, a two-dimensional plot is created and displayed using QWT libraries, as shown in Fig. 4 The amplitude of the ultrasonic capture echoes are represented with colors, from blue \(minimum value\o red \(maximum value\. The previsouly introduced features Zoom and Modulus are also implemented for B-Scans. In addition, 2D Countour options are presented to the user. They allow plotting contour curves so that every curve corresponds to a determined value The minimum and maximum threshold sliders allow setting the minimum and maximum value to be considered, respectively Furthermore, the user can choose to only plot the curves 300 


without the spectrogram representation, just by disabling the Spectrogram checkbox D  C-Scan  Fig. 5  RUSH GUI displaying a C-Scan When a C-Scan is displayed, a three-dimensional spectrogram with color as the amplitude is displayed using OpenGL libraries, as shown in Fig. 5. In order to extend the concept of B-Scans into 3D, we have taken the following approach 200  Given that a 2D pixel can be seen as a square, cubes have been used to extend pixels for 3D rendering 200  In order to be able to see the inside of the scanned object and to detect high amplitudes \(discontinuity of density during the progression of the wave, meaning new material or flaws\, a special OpenGL feature has been used: the density. For this application, both the color and density of the pixels are set according to the amplitude: representation of values go from full transparent and blue for the lowest amplitudes, to opaque and red for the highest amplitudes  Fig. 6  The C-Scan capture shown in Fig. 5, with threshold value set to 0, 53 91 and 99, respectively The C-Scan visualitazion features are completely different from A-Scans and B-Scans. One of the main features of 3D plots is that their values are always displayed in absolute value The GUI provides the option of cut off for low amplitudes to display only the high amplitudes \(flaws\, by setting a threshold as shown in the screenshots in Fig. 6 E  Sub-Dimension Plots In general, an N-dimensional representation can be displayed in a lower dimension. We have used this feature for the RUSH interface. When capturing a C-scan, besides displaying 3D captures, the GUI  provides the option of displaying  in 2D plots \(collection of B-scans\ or 1D plots collection of A-scans\. Similarly, the user can also display a B-scan in 1D \(as a collection of A-scans By default, a capture is plotted in its full dimension. As soon as the user selects to plot it in a lower dimension, the axis sliders are enabled so it can move through the higher dimension F  File I/O and Print features 1  Open and Save The RUSH GUI allows the user to open and save captures from the file menu. When saving a capture, its raw data and its capture information are saved. In addition, the visualization configuration is also appended to the file. As a result, when opening a file, the user retrieves the capture exactly as it was shown when he or she saved the file. This allows the user to adjust the visualization parameters for his or her convenience save the file, and then come at another time and open the file exactly as it used to be before saving it The plots themselves are not saved into the file, for efficiency. Only the raw data and desired visualization parameters are saved using the RUSH serialization. When the user sets a file name, the software makes a block of the desired variables to save and serializes them into the file. Then, when opening a file, the system retrieves the variables. In other words, it is like recovering the context of a plot at the time it was saved. Then, the software immediately generates the plot based on the retrieved variables. Thus the regenerated plot displays the same features as when it was saved 2  Print When the user requests to print, a standard OS printing dialog is shown which presents the current plot maximized to the paper size 3  Export Formats The user can export graphs in additional standard formats such as PDF, SVG, PS and BMP. The first 3 formats benefit from the advantage of storing plots in vector format, so the resulting file size is considerably smaller than a standard image, and presents smooth edges and contours, that can adapt to any resolution IV  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, the objectives of designing a Graphical User Interface to visualize ultrasonic captures of the RUSH platform along with providing the user with a convenient and intuitive way to set and manage FPGA parameter values, have been achieved. Moreover, a communication protocol has been specifically designed for this platform. The RUSH high performance hardware/software co-designed ultrasonic system has been extended by creating a fully customized GUI and its server application by using object-oriented programming approach, while incorporating scientific plot libraries and implementing full 3D rendering  301

These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given

UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
