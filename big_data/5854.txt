Secured e-health data retrieval in DaaS and Big Data  David Shin, Tony Sahama, Randike Gajanayake Science and Engineering Faculty Queensland University of Technology Brisbane, Australia dong.shin@student.qut.edu.au t.sahama@qut.edu.au g.gajanayake@qut.edu.au  Abstract Big Data is one of rising IT trends such as cloud computing, social networking or ubiquitous computing. Big Data can offer beneficial scenarios in the e-health arena However, one of the scenarios can be that Big Data needs to be kept secured for a long time in order to gain its benefits such as 
finding cures for infectious diseases and keeping patients privacy. From this connection, it is beneficial to analyze Big Data to make meaningful infor mation while the data are stored in a secure manner. Thus, the analysis of various database encryption techniques is essential. In this study, we simulated 3 types of technical environments such as Plain-text, Microsoft Built-in Encryption, and custom Advanced Encryption Standard using Bucket Index in Data-as-a-Service. The results showed that custom AES-DaaS has faster range query response time than MS built-in encryption. In addition, while

 Big Data is one of rising IT trends such as cloud computing, social networking and ubiquitous computing Even though Big Data means ‘Big Data’ literally, its concept is still not clear in business fields such as e-health. It is worth exploring what features Big Data has, where it can be utilized or why it is an important concern. This research assume some utilization scenarios as following. In terms of eHealth, Big Data has several benefits. For example, Big Data can advise patients to choose appropriate medical practitioners to cure patients with more success ratio, it can match patients alike such so that they can connect with each other so that they can communicate and share information with respect to their treatments. Healthcare professionals can 
also benefit from Big Data. For instance it can enable drug procurement officers to estimate purchasing medicine times and costs, it can enable pharmacies manage customers buying experiences, accumulate their points and make more discounts for when it is available. Big Data can also explore how efficiently medical emergency systems operate and are controlled such as an ambulance’s arrival time at a patient’s house and bring them to appr opriate medical practitioners within a given time and collect all the patients’ sensor data seamlessly through mobile device to machine communication. Big Data can also be securely kept and stored for decades to find cures for infect ious diseases such as Human immunodeficiency virus infection/ acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome \(HIV/AIDS From the above examples, it is clearly beneficial to analyze Big Data to make meaningful information while the data are stored in a secured manner. Therefore, it is appealing to retrieve valuable information more effectively while the raw data are encrypted for patients’ privacy. Thus one of absolute methods to keep the raw data safe is to use database encryption. In the Data-as-a-Service \(DaaS environment [1 nershi p of da t a  se curit y be lo ngs to the data owner. Nowadays, it is a time of cloud computing that provides Software-as-a-Se rvice \(SaaS\2 at fo rm a s a-Service \(PaaS Infras tructure-as- a-Service \(IaaS 4  Eve n though clo u d  com putin g provi ders such as

Therefore, it is vital to handle Big Data as formatted or unformatted such as NoSQL H o w e ver this research focus on the use of traditional Relational Database Management System \(RDBMS\rather than NoSQL in the condition that some sensitive data are encrypted In this paper, we simulate a scalability test for DaaS. We propose that it will be suitable for scalability testing of Big Data II  L ITERATURE R EVIEW  In this section, the concepts of Big Data, e-health, cloud DaaS, and encryption techniques are introduced

In the case of the Australian healthcare sector cloud computing is one of rising technologies that creates values from health information excha   Cl o ud computing enables the e-health database owners store data for decades. The information extracted and reprocessed from the data will be extremely valuable for curing diseases and encouraging patients. On the other hand, the database encryption techniques are still useful in e-health cloud scenarios because the database owners are responsible for their data even if cloud vendors promise database security as a top priority task C  Logical Data Model in Cloud SQL Server In this study, we focus on Microsoft SQL Server as a DaaS model dataset. Its characteristics can be similar to onpremise SQL server and SQL Azure, which is a cloud database. In Cloud SQL Server, a logical database is called as a table group. A table group can be keyless or keyed. A keyless table group is a normal SQL Server database. There are no limitations on choosing keys for its tables. However if a table group is keyed, all of its tables should include a common column called the partitioning key   D  DaaS and database security Data as a Service \(DaaS\ was a transitional concept for database management before the concept of cloud computing was popular. It permits data owners to outsource their data to Database Service Providers \(DSP\ to reduce the maintenance cost. However, if the data is encrypted, faster query response times for the data become a serious issue 11 T h e d a t a b a se en c r y p ti on t echn i qu e s can b e  v a ri e d  to  database owners’ planning E  Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES AES is a symmetric encryption which can be called as Rijndael algorithm. It was suggested to replace Data Encryption Standard \(DES\hich was also a block cipher Rijndael is a parameterized algorithm in that it can operate on block size of 128, 192, or 256 bits” [1   F  Bloom filter and collections A Bloom filter only responds “y es” or “no” even if it stores the actual data. A Bloom filter can be utilized to facilitate quick answers in a key-value storage system[13   The algorithm is applied in Database Management System DBMS\ such as Oracle 10g R2 and its implementation is introduced as an open source using C# and other programming languages. The following Bucket Index can utilize a Bloom filter as an element in querying translator There is performance comparison between collection objects such as Bloom filter, HashSet and HashTable as follows  Figure 1.performance ratio among collection objects [1  This figure depicts Bloom filter memory loading time takes slightly longer than HashSet or HashTable under Singleton design patterned Bucket Index. HashSet stores only distinctive data whereas HashTable store ‘key=value Overall, HashTable shows fastest response time than the others G  Database security technique – Bucket Index Bucket index application use a bloom filter as a collection of key information that indicates ‘true’ if the data exist in the database. The bucket index engine can have a singleton-patterned architecture for storing key information Among CRUD \(Create, Read, Update and Delete\tions read operation performances are a main concern because it is most heavily used    Figure 2.Bucket Index Architecture 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 Memory Loading Time Search Time Bloom Filter HashSet HashTable

 Figure 3.classification of MS built-in encryp The Bucket Index system can be described as a partitioning data model. At first it collects a coarse partitioning data and after refining the data, decrypt the selected narrower range of data which is partitioned. It will reduce the query response time which is typically a read operation significantly. However, its implementation can be varied with respect to the Bloom filter as a querying translator H  Database security technique – MS built-in encryption Microsoft provides a combination of the encryption decryption programming approach from a database administrator’s \(DBA\nt of view. Firstly, the DBA can choose a master key of the database. Secondly, s/he can choose a certificate or asymmetric key for managing symmetric key to encrypt the database. The master key is also used in managing a certificate or asymmetric key as a hierarchical structure [14   I  Measurement Technology \(performance  Client_response_time: is the total network included round-trip time as requested by the client, starting from sending the request to receiving the corresponding response  Processing_time: the amount of time for processing the request on the server side  DB_processing_time: ideally the amount of time a database takes to process Structured Query Language \(SQL\ [17  Therefore, the generalized performance measurement principle can be as follows Client_response_time  >  Processing_time DB_processing_time  III  M ETHOD  Simulation results confirm various database encryption techniques are significant to review secured data retrieval The results provide scalability and performance review based on query response times.

The processor is Intel Core 2 duo with Windows XP The query conditions are in the following table IV  S IMULATION R ESULTS  Table 3 depicts the times consumed to build up the three environments \(Plain-text, MS built-in Encryption, AESDaaS\when the data is increased from 5K records to 2560K records. The data was dummy and randomly generated by a console C# application The results showed that the MS built-in encryption model took the longest build-up time compared to custom AES-DaaS model or Plain-Text \(PT\ model On the other hand, AES-DaaS model consumes physically additional field in tables. Here, we used extra Bucket Index fields for birth dates. To avoid unnecessary database connection trials, we used a Bloom filter in Singleton Design Patterned. It answers ‘yes’ or ‘no’ for the existence of the data before making a connection to the database Table 4 shows the categorized scalability result in the three environments \(Plain-text, MS built-in encryption, AESDaaS\ “Aggr” means Aggregate query for blood type. RQ means normal range query for birth dates. RC means just to get a counted number of the range query for birth dates

The RBI feature is only available to custom AESDaaS model. In the simulation, we used 70 partitioning for Bucket Index The Bucket Index in the AES-DaaS showed approximately 7 times faster response time than the normal Range query when the record size was 2560K. Thus, Bucket Index is quite useful in custom AES-DaaS model when databases are bigger In figure 4, numeric type scalability trend is drawn for medicare card number. From 5K to 1280K record-sized, the line graph increases gradually, however, in 2560K, the MS built-in encryption technique s how abrupt increased query response time. This means there are certain performance threshold points in any hardware / software  V  C ONCLUSION  If the AES-DaaS model can be adopted, the Bucket Index, in other word, partitioning and singleton design patterned architecture is a useful framework when range queries are heavily used   Figure 4.numeric type scalability trend\(milliseconds\ [1  In addition, if the data characteristic is numeric, the study shows number type is more acceptable to character type when designing the database Finally, the custom AES with Bucket Index shows faster response time than MS built-in encryption. Therefore, when we deal with Big Data encryption techniques, custom encryption techniques are recommended. Besides, cloud DBMS does not support the full feature of on-premise DBMS such as MS SQL Server In conclusion, we covered secured e-health data retrieval in the environments of PT, MSE, and DaaS Custom encryption techniques can increase the efficiency of DBMSs while data needs to be encrypted in a DaaS or Big Data environment.

3  Throughput Through the throughput, system administrators can evaluate system performance clearly, higher throughput indicates that the system can complete more jobs in unit time, and the system resources can be utilized sufficiently Fig. 7 presents the throughput \(number of jobs processed in one minute\ of five schedulers under mixed workload Because the mixed workload contains many large jobs, the value of throughput is low. By solving the locality problem the throughput of fair with delay scheduling can gain an outstanding improvement, which is 1.2 times of that of default FIFO scheduler. Although Naïve Fair sharing and capacity schedulers have different turnaround time, their throughputs are almost same; they are all larger than FIFO scheduler and HOD scheduler  Figure 7  The throughput \(number of jobs processed in one minute running full workload by using five schedulers respectively Through the above experiments, we find fair with delay scheduling scheduler is the most efficient scheduler; it can be shown in DPS, average turnaround time, average running time, and throughput. But due to the affection of data locality some jobs with large size will have longer time to finish than usual jobs For running mixed workload the Naïve Fair sharing and capacity scheduler have the nearly same performance in throughput and DPS two administrator’s perspective, but naïve fair has the shorter average turnaround time and capacity has the shorter average waiting time. Fair with delay scheduling, naïve fair, capacity, these three schedulers are all have the better performance than default FIFO scheduler HOD scheduler preformed not very well, affected by the extra cost of virtualization V  C ONCLUSIONS  With the popularization of Hadoop, numerous private clouds based on Hadoop clusters are established by many organizations. Since these data centers are often used by multiple users, optimizing the performance of Hadoop clusters is very necessary and significant. In this paper, we evaluate the five common Hadoop schedulers by using CloudRank-D, a publicly benchmark suite for private cloud Throughput, Turnaround time and Data Processed per Second are chosen as the metrics of evaluation. Experimental results show that different task schedulers have different influences on system performance in different situation, so the choice of task schedulers is very critical for system performance improvement of Hadoop cluster. Specially, fair sharing with delay scheduling can improve data locality and reduce the cost of network communication between nodes and DPS is improved by 20% than that of FIFO scheduler Optimization and design of the scheduler need to refer to the characteristics of the workload. In the future, we will use more complex workloads to study and evaluate more efficient task schedulers for Hadoop based cloud systems A CKNOWLEDGMENT  Our work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61372171 and the National Key Technology R&D Program of China under Contract No. 2012BAH23B03 R EFERENCES  1  J.

TABLE II Summary of Average Monthly FTP Hit Rate and Monthly Power Consumption Fig 18 Monthly power consumption for 200TB LRU caches with and without prefetching 3 Prefetching and Expansion of Storage Capacity Cache Con\223guration Avg Monthly Hit Rate Avg Monthly Power Watts Avg Monthly Cost  We now examine power consumption of the same two cache con\223gurations in 223gure 18 We observe that the inclusion of prefetching results in an average monthly power consumption of 17,052,688 watts a 15.38 reduction from the 20,152,915 watt average monthly power projection of a 200TB LRU cache without prefetching In this section we provide several possible software and hardware con\223gurations that EROS may choose to improve the performance of its satellite image distribution system presented previously in Figure 7 EROS currently operates with a cache capacity of 100TB and can achieve a 3.71 increase in hit rate through the use of our proposed prefetching algorithms In addition to an increase in hit rate EROS is projected to consume 159,963 less kilowatts of power per month If the system were expanded to a cache capacity of 200TB we predict that an additional 6,244,295 watts of power would be consumed monthly at the bene\223t of 3.71 increase in monthly hit rate If EROS does expand to a larger FTP server our proposed prefetching algorithms have the potential to reduce the power consumption by 3,100,227 watts per month 15.38 Furthermore prefetching on a 200TB LRU cache would increase the hit rate by 2.25 The results of our experiments are summarized in Table II V R ELATED W ORK Massive data systems are characterized by their focus on the warehousing of vast amounts of data and the necessity to serve a multitude of clients simultaneously The current trends in research in the improvement of massive storage systems have focused on the application of solid state disks to take advantage of the myriad of technical bene\223ts they provide Lee et al has presented a thorough evaluation of the bene\223ts of using solid state drives as a cache for a larger sized hard disk array to create a tiered storage architecture in order to improve system throughput as well as to reduce power consumption Other researchers have also explored using SSDs as a faster tier of storage for caching and suggest a similar approach Schall et al have explored using SSDs in high-performance massive databases and measured power consumption under a series of differing loads and access patterns recommending that SSDs not being used as large storage devices but instead as storage for the most highly accessed pieces of data in order to take advantage of the potential power savings provided by SSDs The ER OS system utilizes a tiered hybrid storage system where raw data is stored on magnetic tapes before being requested for processing and sent to the higher layer the FTP servers made of SSDs which can take advantage of SSDs and tradeoff performance and cost when appropriate con\223gures are selected Prefetching has been widely used to increase cache performance 8 9 10 11 12 It w as reported that an effective prefetching algorithm can improve the cache hit ratio by as much as 50 percent It also has been shown that performance can be improved without a higher cost via intelligently prefetching Prefetching techniques can be classi\223ed into informed prefetching and predictive prefetching Informed prefetching relies on user-provided hints while predictive prefetching is based on the analysis results of historical user behavior For the EROS system it is almost impossible to obtain a list of a user\220s future requests before they are submitted to the system Without prior knowledge of a user\220s choices predictive prefetching will be the most appropriate method for offsetting the FTP miss penalty Next Sequential Prefetching NSP 22 23 are also used to explore spatial locality to improve cache performance However the structure of the EROS data prohibits the forming of direct spacial relationships among two images because each request can shift in six possible dimensions Please refer to Section III-B VI C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we have presented a variety of con\223gurations that can be applied to the FTP servers of a public-servicing massive storage system maintained by USGS EROS We have explored the changes in two key metrics performance and power consumption that can be obtained by the adoption of 100TB LRU No Prefetching current 65.8628 13,908,620 1,127 100TB LRU with Prefetching 70.2583 13,748,657 1,114 200TB LRU No Prefetching 69.5770 20,152,915 1,632 200TB LRU with Prefetching 71.8283 17,052,688 1,381 C Summary of Results 


in Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMETRICS Joint International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems various software and hardware con\223gurations leading us to the recommendation that prefetching algorithms be applied to any of the proposed cache con\223gurations in order to increase the hit rate and decrease the system power consumption In addition we have examined the effects of a likely future expansion of FTP server size on the EROS system and found a slight increase in hit rate in addition to the expected substantial increase in power consumption Although the bene\223t of prefetching diminishes as cache sizes become larger we continue to suggest the use of prefetching as a mechanism for offsetting the cost of powering additional hardware The cost of expanding the FTP server farm to 200TB would contain not only a signi\223cant up-front investment about 8 million dollars but an increasing power draw Our experimental results Table II demonstrate that the EROS system can maintain the same level of performance with 31.78 of power savings by using our proposed popularity-based and user-speci\223c prefetching algorithms compared to doubling the size of its FTP server farm Therefore we suggest administrators of large scale massive storage systems fully explore all possible software optimizations before physically expanding the existing system
