Land cover classification from remotely sensed data is an important topic in remote sensing applications. We attempted to investigate the feasibility of using a conventional digital camera for acquiring high 
resolution imagery for land use/cover mapping. The objective of this study is to test the high-resolution digital camera imagery for land cover mapping using remote sensing technique. The study area is the Merbok River estuary, Kedah and Timah Tasoh Lake, Perlis, both located in Peninsular Malaysia. The digital images were taken from a low-attitude light aircraft. A Kodak camera, model DC290, was used to capture images from an elevation of 8000 feet on board Cessna 172Q. The use of a digital camera as a sensor to capture digital images is cheaper and more economical compared to the use of other airborne sensors. This technique overcomes the problem of the difficulty in obtaining cloud-free scenes in the Equatorial

The accuracy of each classification map produced was validated using the reference data sets consisting of a large number of samples collected per category.

In the past few years, there has been a growing interest in the use of remote-sensing systems for regular monitoring of the  increas ing availability of remote 
sensing images, acquired periodically by satellite sensors on the same geographical area, makes it extremely interesting to develop the monitoring systems capable of automatically producing and regularly updating land-cover maps of the considered site Ai rborne rem o t e sensi ng was sel ect ed i n  this present study because of several reasons. First, the airborne images can provide higher spatial resolution for mapping a small study area. Second, the airborne data acquisition can be carried out according to our planned surveys. Third, for airborne remote sensing, atmospheric correction was not necessary to apply to the analysis data because atmospheric correction only improves R 2 and RMS significantly for turbidity. This is an advantage since one 
step of the retrieval proce ss can be elim Land cover classification is a fundamental parameter describing the Eart h\222s surface. With sufficient calibration, a land cover map can be used to identify spatial patterns of physical quantities such as carbon storage or vegetation cover as well as more abstract phenomena such as land use. Accurate information on land cover is required for both scientific research \(eg, climate change modeling flood prediction\anagement \(eg, city planning disaster mitigation\ [4 Our study areas were located in the equatorial region where the sky is often covered by clouds. Therefore satellite remote sensing, especially for sensing in the visible and infrared regions is often not possible. Our research 
group in Universiti Sains Malays ia \(USM used this sensor in their studies for water quality mapping 5  Our object i v e was t o devel op a prot ocol t o overcom e such problems by using an airborne technique. The advantages of an airborne tec hnique include i\ights can be scheduled for the desired time and location, and ii\ the aircraft can be flown belo w cloud cover and acquire high spatial resolution images. However airborne remote sensing techniques are not widely used in environmental applications as they are a ssociated with high operational costs. In this study, we reduced the costs by using a conventional digital camera and hiring a light aircraft 


  2 The sensor used in this study was a normal digital camera model Kodak DC290, and a light aircraft was used as a platform to capture the di gital images. The cost of the present sensor is very much ch eaper than available airborne sensors. Besides, this study is also good for collecting data in planning and management. Supervised classification methods were performed on the digital images. Supervised classification of remote-sensi ng images has been widely used as a powerful means to extract various kinds of information concerning earth environment The objective of supervised classification in remote sensing is to identify and partition the pixels comprising the noisy image of an area according to its class    The t radi t i onal m e t hod of col l ect i ng dat a for pl anni ng i s  surveying samples at field. Remote sensing technique is a useful method for classifying the image. With processed data available, a quick decision about the area can made 2 STUDY AREA  Two study areas were chosen in this study, which were the Merbok River estuary and Timah Tasok Lake. The studied Merbok river estuary is located at latitude 5\272 39\222 N to 5\272 41\222 N and longitude 100 o 20\222 E to 100 o 24\222 E and the studied Timah Tasoh Lake is located at latitudes 6 o  33' N to 6 o 35' N and longitudes 100 o 13' E 100 o 16' E Figure 1\The images for Merbok River estuary were captured on 5 May 2002 and Timah Tasoh Lake was captured on 27 July 2002 from low altitude at 8000 feet The time the digital images were captured during the flight was between 9 a.m to 11 p.m. local time The whole length of Merbok river, being tidally influenced, is mangrove-fringed where saltwater intrusion can be experienced until the upstream end of the river. The estuary width ranges from about 2 km at the estuary mouth to about 15 m towards the upper reaches with depths varying from 15 to 3 m \(except for a few 20 m deep holes where tributaries join the Merbok The catchment area of Merbok Estuary measures 550 km 2 The dry season is in December, January and May with rainfall maxima in October-November and April The mean annual discharge is estimated to be 20 m 3 s 1  Freshwater discharge into the mangrove estuary is not from a single river but rather from numerous small streams that feed into a numbe r of estuarine tributaries So even if the main river is gauged, this discharge does not represent the total freshwater input to the estuary Timah-Tasoh lake is a man-made lake built in 1992 with a cost of RM67 million, supplies water to Perlis folks as well as prevents any occurrence of flood in the state. The lake can hold about 35.3 million liters of water at any one time. Timah Tasoh is now recognized as one of the bird sanctuaries in Malaysia. The reservoir has a mean surface area of 13.32 km 2 and a storage capacity of about 40 million m 3 The reservoir receives input from the Tasoh River and Pelarit River. The reservoir is shallow with a maximum depth of 10 m and submerged aquatic plants can be seen along the shoreline and in shallow areas. At pres ent, the main purpose of the reservoir is to supply water for domestic and industrial use as well as for irrigation and flood control   Figure 1-The location of the study area  3 DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  All image-processing analysis were carried out using PCI Geomatica 10.1 image processing software at the School of Physics, University of Science Malaysia \(USM\e aim of the classification analysis is to categorize all of the pixels in the digital camera imagery in to land cover classes. The camera was not specifically designed for scientific applications, so the required radiometric calibration parameters were not available for reference. The size of the airborne colour digital image of the Merbok River estuary Kedah is 1200 pixels by 1792 lin es and Timah Tasoh Lake Perlis is 1200 pixels by 1792 lines \(Figure 2\Three supervised classification methods were performed to the digital images \(Maximum Likelihood, Minimum Distanceto-Mean, and Parallelepiped\ning sites were needed for supervised classification. Selection of the training sites was based on the colour image. A total of 28 sampletraining sites were selected in this study Many methods of accuracy assessment have been discussed in remote sensing literatures. The most widely promoted and used, however, may be derived from a confusion or error matrix. The confusion matrix is currently at the core of the accuracy assessm Kappa statistic was used in this study. It is widely used because all elements in the classification e rror matrix, not just the main diagonal, contribute to its calculation and because it 


  3 compensates for change agreem ent [10]. Kappa coefficients were generated to describe the proportion of agreement between the classification result and the validation sites after random agreements by chance are removed from consideration of these data.  The results are shown in Table 1  Many methods of accuracy assessment have been discussed in remote sensing literatures. Three measures of accuracy were tested in this study, namely overall accuracy error matrix and Kappa coe fficient. The most widely promoted and used accuracy measure, however, may be derived from a confusion or error matrix. The confusion matrix is currently at the co re of the accuracy assessment literature The Kappa statistic is a statistical m e thod of assessing accuracy that takes into account the chance of random agreement. This statistic has been used by many researchers in their studies 10]. Producer\222s accuracy indicates how well training set pixels were classified, user accuracy indicates the probability that a classified pixel actually represents that category in reality and overall accuracy is the total number of correctly classified pixels divided by the total number of reference pixels   Finally, the classified maps were exported to TIFF files for viewing by other computer software, such as Microsoft Word   a   b Figure 2. Digital images used in image classification, \(a Merbok River estuary and \(b a\erbok River estuary  A total of 26 sample-training areas were studied in this analysis. The digital image was classified into 4 classes namely water, forest, land, and urban. Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy results of the three measures of accuracy are shown in Table 1. The overall accuracy is expressed as a percentage of the test-pixels successfully assigned to the correct classes   Table 1.

A classified image using Maximum Likelihood classifier is shown in Figure 4 All land cover classes showed producer and user accuracies of higher than 50 in this case. Building class had producer accuracy of 75.000% and user accuracy of 50.000%. Building class had producer accuracy as land class but it had a low user accuracy of 31.579%. This is an indication that for the urban class the omission error is low but the commission error is high \(many pixels were incorrectly classified

Digital camera image can provide an alterna tive solution to replace images from satellite for a relatively small region of interest. So the problem of obtaining cloud free images from satellite in equatorial region can be overcome with the airborne images. The proposed technique also gives an alternative airborne data acquisitions to provide low cost digital imageries for remotely sensed application. From the two classified map, Maximum Likelihood gives a good result for land cover mapping. The Maximum Likelihood has become a standard classifier in remote sensing data analysis. Many researchers also used the Maximum Likelihood method in their study. The digital camer a imagery can be used to provide useful data for planning and management. The high spatial resolution images gave more detail information of the classified map. Therefore, it is good for a small coverage of study area where more detailed classes can be generated. This technique comp arative is cheaper that other airborne techniques. Besides, this technique can also overcome the problem of difficulty in obtaining cloud-free images from satellites in equatorial region. The application of the conventional digital camera for land cover mapping produced reliable and accurate results 5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This project was carried out using the USM short term grants and Science Fund.

of other processes, standardizing them and linking with technology in an ES-enabled environment made those processes very rigid and inflexible. The best practice processes embedded in the software are considered truly best practices in this organization With regular updates ensuring the incorporation of latest developments in practices and technologies, it is generally believed that the requisite agility is also part of the best practices. This study results suggest the influence of integration and standardization characteristics on the firm s ability to build agility in their processes. The effects, however, vary depending upon the type of integration and the extent of that integration achieved by the organization after the implementation of enterprise system. While the technical tight-coupling of the enterprise system infrastructure may limit the firm s ability to build agile processes, both vertical and horizontal integration, and standardization of the processes and information appears to be contributing positively While demanding their IT infrastructures to be tightly integrated for control and visibility purposes with the help of enterprise systems, firms are seeking to deliver agility with loosely coupled systems and technologies simultaneously. Though it is considered difficult to achieve both agility and control simultaneously in the past, today introduction of web services and service oriented architecture are expected to deliver both. Recognizing the weaknesses of enterprise systems, ES software vendors and business organizations are expending a significant proportion of their IT investment in Web services and business process management technologies The leading enterprise systems software vendors such as SAP and Oracle are now incorporating Web services standards into their next generation software solutions. For example, SAP has so far delivered 1000 Web service components and recently released the first Web services enabled ES suite. These emergent technologies are centered on the goal of providing the requisite process agility to enterprises by offering a competent business process platform from which to dynamically compose processes [70 37  B u ild in g ag i lit y  in to b u si n e s s p r o cesses a n d  implementing them is not easy and is dependent not just on the IT infrastructure including enterprise systems, but also on other factors such as business process management maturity levels and process characteristics specific to a particular organization Further research on building and implementing agile processes in dynamic business environments is necessary   7.

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
