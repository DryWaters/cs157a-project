In this paper, a programming dataset was mined using rough set in order to investigate the significant factors that may influence students programming performance based on information from previous student performance. Then, the result was compared with other researches which had previously explored the data using statistic clustering, and association rule. The dataset consists of 419 records with 70 attributes were pre-processed and then mined using rough set. The result indicates rough set has identified several new characteristics. The student who has been exposed to programming prior to entering university and obtained average score in Mathematics, English, and Malay Language subject during secondary Malaysian School Certificate \(SPM examination were among strong indicators that contributes to good programming grades. Besides that, the personality factor the investigative and social type plus average cognitive person were also found as important factors that influence programming. This finding can be a guideline for the faculty to plan teaching and learning program for new registered student Keywords- programming, influence factor, rough set I.  INTRODUCTION 


One of the essential skills in computer related studies \(IT is the ability to write computer program well.  Many universities in the world consider programming as core subjects which need student to pass the subject. The subject teaches student to write an error-free program and trains them to solve problem using the most optimal solution and produces a quality system Many technologies that we enjoyed today are resulted of the computer programming. A programmer with strong programming skill has high responsibility to produce a valuable and quality system. The good programmer is the one who has ability to analyze and compare his native programming languages and seek the advantages and disadvantages of modern languages and language concepts [1 In job market, there are many vacancies offered which requires good programming skills as basis. In [2], more programmers are required in 2010 which is 50% increases in the number of currently required. This is an opportunity for candidates with good programming  background to seek computer related job such as programmer, system analyst, and software engineer. However, graduates with low programming skill might get less opportunity in software related job To meet the industry requirement, universities are keen to produced graduates with good programming skill. Yet, high failure rates were reported among students in higher institution taking programming courses. [5] and [7] reported that the failure rates in programming courses are about 30% to 40 which is considered high. Although the graduates have been trained with many programming experiences, some of them are failed to apply the skills when they start working [6 Learning to program is not an easy task to many students Most students believe that computer programming is difficult and they require more time to master the core concept [3 Similar to [4], programming is assumed as a tough subject for new student which distracts their motivation to learn programming.  In solving problem through programming, the students are required to develop the abstract representation of the problems and express them in a logical structure and detailed realization in programming language which to them is complicated [8]. Naturally, programming requires thinking and analytical skill. [3] indicate the student perception on the programming subject might contribute to their final grade on 


the subject as well as high school calculus and science result gander, and comfort level. Additionally, the confident level about their programming capabilities also helps them to understand the subject easily [4 Interest in the performance issue among programming students has long been studied among researchers. Moreover there have been few studies in recent years on academic success in computer programming which lead to assumption that intelligent student can write a program well. In contrast there are students who are proficient at many other subjects sometimes fail to succeed in programming [6 Many studies have been conducted to identify the possible factors that contribute to the successfulness of student grade in Mining the Student Progra  ___________________________________ 978-1-4244-6793-8/10/$26.00 2010 IEEE  computer proficiency. As summarized in literature conducted by [7], the high school mathematics grade, prior experience cognitive ability, learning style, personality types, self efficacy mental model, and gender are among the parameters for evaluating computer skills.  The need of high-quality programming skills is increased in demand; therefore the learning ability of end user programming system is important Research on learning barrier in programming courses has primarily focused on languages, overlooking potential barriers in the environment and human factors such as personality and aptitude. Therefore, the ability to predict an individuals potential to learn programming concept is important for many reasons [9]. [7] discovered students who have good background in Mathematics and English, own investigative type personality, have programming experience, and male are more likely to succeed at programming subject. They researched undergraduate students profile in order to identify the relationship between academic background, personality and aptitude towards programming skill. In line with [7], [8 justified that the mother language is a barrier to understand programming batter In this study, we researched the programming characteristics that influence the student grade using data mining method. Data mining algorithm called rough set is used 


to understand the relationship between characteristics. A dataset of Malaysians undergraduate student from Faculty of IT, UUM were mined using rough set.  Rough set is a classification framework for discovering relationship in imprecise data and can extract hidden pattern inside data Previously, this dataset has been analyzed using statistical approach [7], decision tree [10], and association rule [11]. We keen to compare the result with previous finding since different techniques will generate different sets of relationships although they are implemented to the same problem and produce comparable result [12 This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the basic notion of Rough Set.  The model development of the study is discussed in section 3. The experiment and result will be presented in section 4 and final sections conclude this work II. ROUGH SET In this section, the theory of rough set will be discussed The theory was founded by Zidslaw Pawlak in the early 1984s provides a mathematical approach to deal with uncertainty and vagueness [13]. The main goal of the approach is to derive rules from a set of data which is represented in a decision system. It is donated as Ds= {U, Dc, Dd} where U is a finite set of objects called universe, Dc is a set of condition attributes and Dc is decision attribute. RS theory is based on the establishment of equivalence classes in training data set and the formation is almost indiscernible. RS deals with imprecise information in information system \(IS which each vague object are described in lower and upper approximation space. Consider an IS= {U, A} and X|U be a set of objects and B|A be a selected of attributes.  B-lower approximation is defined as Bx={X ? U:[x]B ? X} while Bupper approximation is Bx={X ? U:[x]B ? X ? 0}. The set Bx or Bx which respect to the knowledge provide by B.  The set BNB\(X Bx-Bx is called B-boundary of X which consist of those objects that not surely belong to X Rough set modeling assumes the existences of several attribute in a data set are more important compares to others This is done by the reduct function which will determine only important attribute to represent the whole problem.  Reduct calculation determines the number rule, rule length, and accuracy of the classifier. There are several algorithms to 


perform reduct such as Johnson Reducer, Genetic Algorithm Dynamic Reduct, Holte1R, and SIP/DRIP.  Each method use different method to control the generation of rule from dataset Generally, the rough set approach consists of several steps leading towards the final goal of generating rule from information system as given below Forming decision system by mapping information from the data source Completion of data Descritization of data Reducts computation of data Obtain rule from the reduct Classification of new unseen data  III. MODEL DEVELOPMENT The experimental dataset use in this study is called programming dataset.  It comprises information about performance profile of Bachelor of Information Technology students of Faculty of IT, Universiti Utara Malaysia in the year 2004-2005 The dataset were merging of two data collections.  First primary data was collected from two instruments randomly distributed to students who have taken introductory programming which represents student personality type Second, further data of the respondents on their previous academic background, demographic variable and grade in Introductory Programming course was obtained from the Academic Affairs Department of the university. Figure 1 depicts the model development of the study The performance information are the student result in several programming subject particularly in introductory programming, demographic information such as gender, prior experience in programming, Malaysia Certificate of Education SPM seven question aptitude test, and personality test. There are 419 records elaborated with 70 mixture types of attributes and a decision class. They represent about 31% of the population The students come from various program such as Bachelor in Information Technology \(BIT BMM DEC Education specializing in IT \(EDU introductory programming subject. Table I shows the 


distribution of students in terms of gender and program. There are 72% female students and 28% male students where about 75% students are from the BIT program  Data Cleaning Attribute Reduction Data Allocation Rough Set GA Reduct ComputationDicernability Matrix ROSETTA Data Descritization 1011 1121 1001 Equivalence class Evaluate factor that effect student grades Personality test Color Test Questionnaire Academic records UUM Academic Affairs Department Programming Dataset Integrate 5 folds 90:10 80:20 70:30 60:40 50:50 Generate rule

To mine the data, this study was divided into two phases namely data preparation for mining and pattern extraction  A. Data Preparation for mining During preprocessing task, all dataset were pre-processed where all unknown numeric attributes were replaced with mean value while max value for character attributes.  Then, the data were discretized using boolean reasoning technique. The programming dataset contains large number of attributes \(70 attributes therefore only important attributes were selected for mining During selection, nine attribute which stored student experience status in particular programming skill namely Java C++, C, Visual Basic, ASP, PHP, COBOL, Pascal, and Prolong were reclassified into three new groups based on the programming language characteristic.  The new groups were Object, Structured, and Declarative.  Figure II shows the reduction of nine attributes into Object, Structured, and Declarative  Figure 2.  Attribute reduction on student experience attributes in particular programming language Out of the 70 attributes, only 21 attributes were accepted for the next stage as depicted in figure 3. The data was then split into training \(tn tr validation technique. There were 5 different folds created based on ratio of tn and tr; 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50 


Table II portrays the marks of each category. The categories were considered as target during mining. The output of this phase was a set of clean data TABLE II.

Pattern Mining In this phase, the clean dataset was mined using rough set technique and ROSETTA was chosen as rough classifier tools In the application, it has 4 reduct computation algorithmsGenetic Algorithm \(GA and Holte1R. The reduct method determines the selection of important attributes that can represent the problem and later use in generating classification rule. It effects the quality of rule or valuable knowledge such as the number of rule, the length of the generated rule, the accuracy of rule in classifying new problems. Figure 4 depicts the basic reduct computation method. From the preliminary reduct selection test, GA was selected to mine the programming dataset since it had generated better accuracy.  Rough set is a supervised learning 


type. Thus, the last column of dataset that is the programming skill- excellent, good, fair, and weak was considered as target To extract the characteristics that influence programming the experiment was divided in two processes. First, find the best model which can be the best representation of the whole data. The selection of the best model is based on the accuracy of the model, the less number of rule generated, shorter rule and has high coverage. Second, evaluates the best model to identify the characteristic that influence student programming grade.  In this step, it focused at excel and weak programming group  Figure 4.  Basic Reduct Computation [17 IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULT In this section, the experiment results of the mining are represented. The goals and notations of the experiments are formalized. The rough set model is given as RS. The training and testing data are given as tr and ts while the chosen reduct functions namely Genetic Algorithm is given as GA.  Since RS is a rule based mining method, it generates knowledge in rule form. Thus, the accuracy \(acc nr maximum length of rule \(rl cv recorded during experiment.  Those are the criteria to select the best model. The acc of the classification shows how good the obtained rule can classify new cases. Beside that, the nr indicates the amount of knowledge needed to provide good accuracy while the rl is maximum number of condition attribute of the rule. cv refers to coverage of the mined knowledge towards unseen data. Table V portrays the mining results of programming data TABLE V.  THE MINING RESULT tn:ts GA acc nr rl cv 90:10 83 32,629 4 0.175472 80:20 86 27,651 3 0.190909 70:30 90.5 23,109 3 0.208108 60:40 90 18.443 3 0.242 50:50 80 15,181 3 0.245833  From the table V, all models seem had generated a comparable result in term of acc, rl, and cv. The 60:40 model was chosen as the best model. This was due to the high acc 


good rule cv with less nr.  Although the acc of 70:30 model was 0.5 higher than 60:40, the distinction was not significant as well as had generated the greater nr. The model with lesser nr but generates good acc is better than model that use more rule to generate same result [12]. Table VI shows the rule classification of the best model. The last column depicts the nr of each programming skill and tr is the number of training record to generate nr   TABLE VI.

The rule sample of the excellent and weak group From the analysis on the generated rules, it shows that student with programming experience before enter the university has benefit to score the programming subject However, some rules indicate that the programming background is not guarantee the student can score programming well. The result was similar to [7, 10, 11].  In line with many literatures, gender plays important role when male is performed better than female. Furthermore, rough set analysis found that student can score programming well with only the average grade in Mathematic and English during SPM at least at grade C subject might face difficulties in learning programming Additionally, another finding which is contradict with previous study is the majority of excel group student has good grade in Malay Language \(at least B grade program that needs student to enroll programming subject, all programs have similar chances to score the subject The relationship between personality factors towards programming grades was also investigated.  Out of 3003 rules of excellent group, there are 2184 rules which describe the personality test result.  We further investigated all rules and from the analysis, many students with investigative type and average cognitive ability have ability to excel programming The findings were similar to [7, 11]. Interestingly, rough set also identified that the social type student also can do programming well. From the literature, a social type is an emphatic, warm, kind, patient and helpful person as well as prefers to teach and help others. Figure 6 summarizes the rule analysis of personality test of the excellent group. The figure shows that the highest score of the investigative type student C11-C20 and C21-C32 social type student. Based on Holland the theory, it is not suggested the personality of student must fall into one the six categories, but rather are composed of one each of the six 


personality orientation. Generally, the Investigative, Artistic and Social are expected to associate together and less of the characteristic associated with Realistic, Enterprising, or conventional personality type [18  Figure 6.

CONCLUSION In this paper, a dataset of undergraduate student from Faculty of IT, UUM was mined using rough set technique Formerly, there were several researches had mined the data using statistic, clustering, and association rule. This study was aimed to identify another unique characteristic that influence student programming grade using other data analysis method The study indicates that student prior experience in programming before university can contributes to a good grade but it is not guarantee that they can easily score the subject The study also reveals that average grades in Mathematic English, and Malay language during SPM also can influence the final grade. Moreover, male student performance is looked better than female.  In term of personality factor, the investigative and social type plus average cognitive person are found as important factors that influence programming.  This finding can be a guideline for the faculty to plan teaching and learning program for new registered student  REFERENCES  1] Z.H.Khan.
