IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING VOL 10 NO 5 MAY 2017 1681 Satellite-Based Nowcasting of Extreme Rainfall Events Over Western Himalayan Region Bipasha Paul Shukla C M Kishtawal and Pradip K Pal Abstract Western Himalayan WH region is considered to be one of the most vulnerable spots for 037ash 037ooding-related natural disasters in the world The con\037uence of moist air advected from Arabian sea with complex terrain has produced a series of extreme rainfall triggered disasters in recent past However the causal events leading to these enhanced episodes of precipitation lack clarity and thus 037ash 037ood forecasting still remains a big challenge In this paper we address the problem by studying cloud development over this region and its relationship with the underlying topography Our results demonstrate that WH region is mostly inhabited by low-medium level clouds and governed by warm rain processes Satellite-based analysis shows that in comparison to cloud top temperature cloud top cooling rate CTCR is a better indicator for extreme rain producing events over this region A model for nowcasting of extreme orographic rain events has thus been developed using the spatial characteristics of CTCR to predict potential locations for orographically induced severe precipitation events The heavy rainfall nowcasts produced by this methodology when compared with global precipitation 036elds show very encouraging results The probability of positive identi\036cation of a heavy rainfall event is 82.8 with a false alarm rate of 29.7 and average lead time of 2ñ3 h The insights provided by this study will give an impetus to the 037ash 037ood advance warning over WH region bringing about a signi\036cant bene\036cial societal

High-resolution observation networks such as Doppler weather radars automatic weather stations wind proﬁlers radiometers that monitor and provide accurate data at short spatial and temporal intervals are the most essential components of an extreme rainfall nowcasting system In the regions where the ground-based observations are scarce the data acquired from geostationary satellites are helpful   in predicting t he e v olution of convective systems due to their vertical development  Ho we v e r  in an orographic t errain s trong updrafts leading to heavy precipitation are forced rather than dynamically driven The forced uplift generally does not attain the heights associated with free convection  r esulting i n r elati v ely w armer cloud tops which are difﬁcult to observe in satellite images This paper aims to provide a spatial characterization of cloud development and extreme rainfall events ERE leading to ash oods over Western Himalayan WH terrain It also addresses the problem of satellite-based nowcasting to predict potential locations of heavy rainfall in the orographic region Accordingly in Section II description of the data and their sources is discussed Section III describes the spatial variability of extreme events over the Indian region including the ones produced due to hilly terrain This is followed by details about the development of model for Nowcasting of ExTreme orographic Rain NETRA events in Section IV validation and application of the model in Section V and the conclusions in Section VI II D ATA U SED In the present study half-hourly thermal

line/dots are the mean the bars represent the standard deviation IV M ODEL D EVELOPMENT  NETRA A Background and Motivation The enhancement of rainfall over orographic regions may be governed by different physical mechanisms such as forced lifting differential advection of moist air cooling of warm moist air over snow covered mountains etc To investigate the cloud properties CALIPSO-GOCCP cloud fraction vertical proﬁles are plotted in Fig 4 for June–September 2006–2010 both for a Indian region and b WH Here the mean vertical proﬁles and the standard deviations of cloud fraction are plotted For the whole Indian monsoon region which includes the WH region as well the clouds are climatologically found to be present in the upper strata of the troposphere although the high level cloud variability is also found to be higher This is expected since it belongs to Tropical deep convective zone In contrast for the WH the low-medium cloud fraction is predominant as compared to high clouds and there are no sharp jumps in variability too This is surprising when we compare with the statistics of heavy rainfall over this region since high clouds are conventionally more associated to heavy rainfall However a recent study demonstrates the weak linkage between the tallest storms and the heaviest rainfall where a structure of low echo top height with large downward increase of reﬂectivity is found to be associated with ash ood events Most satellite-based rainfall estimations rely on the coldness of the cloud top as a valuable signature Thus the low-topped precipitation systems are difﬁcult to identify in satellite images These f eatures associated with precipitation i n W H present a challenging task in their prediction using satellite data However it is seen that most of the orographic rainfall is triggered by moderate to strong updrafts which may hold the key for forecast of terrain forced severe rainfall The mechanism responsible for initiating precipitation in warm clouds such as in case of orographic storm is coalescence among cloud droplets which usually requires a high sustained updraft High updraft velocity is also postulated to be directly related to larger drop-size resulting in intense spell of rainfall The updraft speed of growing convective clouds which is regarded as the most direct measure of the strength of a storm can be measured from satellites as the cloud top cooling rate CTCR B Algorithm Details Earlier studies ha v e sho wn t hat CTCR can be v e ry useful for identifying vigorous cloud growth if cloud-top parcels are much warmer than the environment Thus a model for Nowcasting of ExTreme orographic Rain NETRA has been developed based on the premise that the updrafts characterizing orographic lifting bear a strong relationship to the spatial distribution of CTCR pixels NETRA comprises of three major components rst is computation of CTCR from half-hourly satellite data second is calculation of thresholds and third is the process of choosing those pixels which have a potential for causing ash oods 1 Computation of CTCR The computation of CTCR is based on the University of Wisconsin Convective Initiation UWCI algorithm which utilizes geostationary satellite TIR data to compute cloud-top cooling UW-CTC rates  I n t he present case 30 min TIR channel data of Kalpana satellite are taken to rst calculate a two-box mean brightness temperature BT centered on each pixel Here the smaller box considered is the pixel itself and the larger box is its 3  3 pixels neighbourhood First a gross cloud test is applied to delineate cloudy pixels based on a combination of a spatial coherence test and threshold after using a median lter  S imilar t o t he UWCI technique in this paper for each pixel we have computed the average BT for cloudy pixels for the small box and a larger box This is then followed by temporal differencing of box-averaged BTs to produce unﬁltered CTCRs This is done by computing the change in BT in a cloudy pixel in two half-hourly successive frames current–previous frame Finally we apply a series of tests using small and big boxes to produce the nal ltered CTCR eld Small/large box approach eliminates most of false alarms due to cloud motion associated with horizontal advection and motion of thin cirrus clouds over generally clear areas or small cumulus elds The main goal of these lters is to retain only the true cooling due to storm updrafts However in situations where there is fast cloud movement and thick cirrus cover the algorithm may not perform well 2 Exceedance Thresholds of CTCR Considering the complex orography the most challenging aspect was to compute exceedance thresholds for CTCR Most operational algorithms use BT threshold BTT or a xed threshold FT for CTCR However due to orographic forcing the cooling of a cloud mass will be dependent on underlying terrain and thus exceedance thresholds cannot be assumed to have a constant value for the entire study region Thus spatially varying thresholds SVT were computed For this half-hourly Kalpana TIR data were used for the entire monsoon period of 2012 which was regridded at 0.1  0.1 degree grid For every grid point a dataset of CTCR was constructed from a time series of TIR values using the method described in Section IV-B1 Next every CTCR dataset is tted with a probability distribution function PDF It was found that Gamma distribution f  x  a  b  which is deﬁned by 2 was most suited to model the distribution of CTCR f  x  a b  1 b a 002 a  x a  1 e  x b x 003 0  004  2

adjusted for hits associated with random chance A higher value of ETS is desirable For extreme events symmetric extreme dependency index SEDI is also considered to be a useful testing measure which takes into account the very low base rate of extreme events  It can be seen from Table II that though POD is the highest for FT FAR is also very high Similarly for BTT the FAR is very low but POD is also low In contrast SVT exhibit a high POD with a low FAR The ETS is thus the highest for SVT highlighting its best performance SEDI score for SVT is found to be 96.9 which shows the capability of the proposed model for operational application The probability of positive alert of a heavy rainfall event within 1 degree search window is 82.8 B Application Of NETRA Over Two Major Cloudburst Events We further apply the NETRA model over two cloudburst events Both these events were warm cloud processes developed rapidly and caused immense damage within short span These events were so chosen so as to exemplify the performance of NETRA in cases which are otherwise difﬁcult to predict 1 Description of Case 1 Kedarnath 30.73N 79.07E 16 18 June 2013 In this case there was catastrophic heavy rainfall and ash ooding in WH region in the state of Uttarakhand which caused loss of thousands of lives and mass scale destruction of enormous proportion There have been several hypotheses regarding the causative factors of the incessant rainfall triggering such a disaster During the period there was conﬂuence of two branches of monsoon Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal Due to this there was a rapid advancement of the monsoon trough which was dragged by upper air westerly system towards north which propelled the low pressure system to the north-west  T he lar gest i mpact has been around K edarnath the religious destination which was attended by thousands of people during the annual pilgrimage season 2 Description of Case 2 Ukhimath Rudraprayag 30.51N 79.10E 13ñ14 September 2012 An incident of cloud burst happened in Ukhimath in Uttarakhand state around 0100 hours IST in the night of 13–14 September 2012 majorly affecting 34 villages T he incident caused a major loss to life and property with nearly 50 persons found dead and many reported missing The TRMM observed rainfall amount for the speciﬁc events is found to be 812.2 and 464.5 mm for Kedarnath and Ukhimath respectively  In Fig 7 the rst row illustrates the results for Kedarnath while the second row presents the results for Ukhimath Fig 7\(a plots the BT of the cloudy pixels as observed by TIR channel of Kalpana satellite for the two events For Kedarnath event it can be observed that although a large-scale system is present in the western part the clouds are warm as evident from the BT values which are in the range of 230–240 K However when we plot the BT difference  see Fig 7\(b  in the course of half an hour 0700 GMT to 0730 GMT 16th June it is observed that there is a decrease in the BT values of the order of 30 K around 30  N 79  E This indicates that the cloud tops have rapidly become colder implying strong updrafts It can be concluded that the Fig 7 a Observed TIR BT b Rate of change of BT K/min using two consecutive images c Predicted region for heavy/extreme rainfall using FT d Predicted region for heavy/extreme rainfall using SVT with star  006  representing location of maximum impact thermodynamic instability is brought upon by the rapid ascent of the parcel in this case resulting in extreme precipitation On applying the NETRA model an area with centroid at 30.44  N 78.69 and radius of inﬂuence of 58.71 km was predicted for intense rainfall activity The same has been shown in red in Fig 7\(d The VQI of the location is also high demonstrating that the location is prone to recurrent ERE Interestingly this was the worst affected region during the Uttarakhand catastrophe shown by a star where continuous and strong episodes of rainfall ultimately led to the collapse of the Chorabari Lake 30  44 007 N 79  1 007 E causing unprecedented ashﬂoods Needless to say the terrain Terrain Map Fig 3 was catalytic to the disaster not only in terms of slope instability but also in triggering intense spells of rainfall The convergence of strongly favorable meteorological conditions with topography region was responsible for large-scale incessant precipitation Interestingly SVT  see Fig 7\(d  in contrast to FT  see Fig 7\(c  pick up only the region corresponding to the area of maximum impact However the supposed false alarms by FT in the plain region could not be veriﬁed due to the absence of dense grid of rain gauges in the location Similarly for Ukhimath event it is demonstrated that the NETRA model is able to predict exact location The lead time difference in the time of the satellite image and the actual occurrence of cloudburst of more than 4 h in both cases along with accurate forecasted region illustrates the operational capability of the model At present the model is being used to provide real-time alerts over WH region through Indian Space Research Organization’s web portal www.mosdac.gov.in VI C ONCLUSIONS A satellite-based investigation is carried out to analyze the recurrent occurrences of ash ood producing extreme rainfall over WH region The study revealed that the WH region is predominantly inhabited by low-to-medium level clouds The vertical growth of clouds in this case is more conducive to warm rain processes and bears a strong relationship with the underlying orography of the region A nowcasting model NETRA has been developed by considering the spatial distribution of satellite derived CTCR to forecast potential locations of heavy precipitation The model is validated for the year 2013 monsoon

S Yang et al  Semantic Inference on Clinical Documents Combining Machine Learning Algorithms With an Inference Engine  TABLE 7 Comparison of different classifiers used in CDTS and determine the one whose symptoms are the closest to those of the new patient at this stage and its corresponding treatment strategy is hereby applied to the patient at this stage It is of note that the treatment phase numbers of the old and new medical records might not be the same in this case Afterward the treatment phase number for the new patient is adjusted to the historical medical record's next treatment phase number Repeat Rule1 until the patient fully recovers For example a dataset  will be established when the symptoms of a new patient in the third phase do not match the historical records at the same time point Then we go through all of the records again and if any two phases of one historical record share similar symptoms with the 034rst two phases of the new patient it will be kept in   Given that any historically successful treatment 021 has m treatment phases on average the comparison procedure will be conducted C 2 m D m\050m 000 1\051  2 times at most If there are n cases then the time complexity is O\050n 003 m 2 051 This method is used to capture extended similar historical cases After the establishment of   all of the phases of the cases in  are compared with the third phase of the new patient treatment on the symptoms to 034nd the most similar one with the maximum rank at the similarity measurement matrix   which determines the treatment strategy for the new patient at the third phase C RESULTS AND ANALYSIS To enlarge the training dataset we randomly resample the dataset 1000 times without replacement by using the 034lter Resample in Weka In Table 7 iOVFDT constructs the smallest tree model compared with the other three classi\034ers in terms of the nodes leaves and depth HT and HAT also perform well in the construction of a nice tree model with 97 and 116 nodes 50 and 58 leaves and 21 and 23 depths respectively HOT has the largest tree size with more nodes and leaves which implies training dataset over\034tting As shown in Figs 8 and 9 Hoeffding-based tree classi\034ers have better performance compared to iOVFDT in terms of the classi\034cation correctness 050i.e accuracy\051 and kappa statistic 050i.e stability\051 With continuous incoming instances the accuracy and stability of Hoeffding-based tree classi\034ers rise with some 035uctuation while the performance of iOVFDT is kept at a horizontal level Similar to HAT the voted ensemble FIGURE 8 Comparison of classification correctness FIGURE 9 Comparison of the Kappa statistic FIGURE 10 Comparison of the evaluation time of the CPU multi-classi\034cation algorithm 050VEMCA\051 also performs well in terms of accuracy and stability and outperforms HAT when the number of instances is larger than 340000 Figs 10 and 11 compare the evaluation time of the CPU and the memory cost of the 034ve classi\034cation algorithms iOVFDT shows the fastest speed and the smallest memory cost among the 034ve classi\034cation algorithms HT gives better performance than HAT and HOT with 6.93 seconds in CPU occupation and a 0.91-Mb memory cost VEMCA's evaluation time and memory are 20.73 seconds and 1.62 Mb respectively VOLUME 5 2017 3543 


S Yang et al  Semantic Inference on Clinical Documents Combining Machine Learning Algorithms With an Inference Engine  FIGURE 11 Comparison of the memory cost VIII CONCLUSIONS Modern techniques such as CDSS and HIS have substantially facilitated clinical diagnosis and treatment However some of the emergent problems remain to be considered The 034rst problem is challenging the traditional data analysis techniques due to rapidly increasing amounts of multidimensional clinical data The second is the dif\034culty of clinical information integration Clinical information from different contexts are heterogeneous in terms of structure and semantics For the bene\034t of patients and long-term clinical development it is very promising to integrate clinical information 050e.g outpatients medical records\051 from different clinicians or hospitals to assist in clinical decision-making The third problem is the call for personalized medicine and professional medical treatment because different doctors or hospitals are good at diagnosing and treating different diseases and the patients have the freedom to choose among them To solve the three problems above this paper proposes a clinical diagnosis and treatment system 050CDTS\051 that assists patients in choosing clinicians or hospitals according to their requirements 050e.g distance from home to hospital\051 The foundation for disease detection in CDTS consists of decision trees that are created by our voted ensemble multiclassi\034cation algorithm that enables decision-tree-based data stream mining Furthermore to integrate clinical documents and heterogeneous health information systems a new clinical tabular document model is proposed which represents clinical documents in tabular format and maintains consistent vocabulary terms and semantic relations among different contexts through the term chain and semantic relation chain Additionally a novel semantic inference algorithm is designed for disease detection and treatment suggestion based on the rules that are generated by decision trees and similarity computations among medical records The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows 342 A uni\034ed clinical tabular document model 050CTDM\051 implemented by a new clinical tabular document language 050DocLang XML based\051 facilitates the interoperability among different clinical decision support systems 050CDSS\051 342 A new voted ensemble multi-classi\034cation algorithm is proposed in terms of running multiple decision treebased classi\034cation algorithms simultaneously on the same data stream and voting for the best output The results are associated with statistical information on the accuracy of classi\034cation which provides proof of optimization 342 A novel clinical diagnosis and treatment system with a newly designed semantic inference algorithm supports clinicians in the decision making process as well as saving time and expense for the patients For future work it is necessary to expand DocLang to become a more comprehensive markup language by importing more semantic relation types for more complex clinical documents These studies are in progress and are expected to present valuable results later REFERENCES   M A Makary and M Daniel Medical error\026The third leading cause of death in the US BMJ  vol 353 p i2139 May 2016   D Kopec M H Kabir D
