An Application of Association Rule Mining Based on Stock Market  Anantaporn Srisawat Department of Computer Science King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand   AbstractStock trading is a popular approach for money investment. This paper focuses on Thai stock market which has hundreds of individual stocks. The aim of this paper is to apply an association rule mining technique for discovering the relationships between individual stocks.  The transactional dataset used to generate the rules consists of 242 trading days from 4 January 2010 to 30 December 2010. The results from the discovered association rules can indicate the trends of related individual stocks. In addition, these rules may help beginner stock traders to preliminary select interesting stocks for further analysis Keywords  association rule, data mining, stock trading, Thai stock market, relationship between stocks I  I NTRODUCTION  Today, most people invest their money in stock trading especially for online trading.  There are many aspects on stock investment prominence. First, it doesn't need a lot of money to invest. If you have 10,000 Baht, you can trade a stock but cannot invest in gold or real estate. Second, it uses a short term to get a profit from stock trading may be on one day or a few days. In addition, a return value of stock investment is greater than an interest from bank saving. However, there is a high risk in stock investment if a trader does not have any knowledge about stocks in the market Currently there are two analysis methods for stock trading: fundamental and technical analyses Fundamental analysis focuses on the fundamental factors of an individual stock. This method is used to evaluate a circumstance of an individual company. There are two strategies of the evaluation: qualitative and quantitative analys alit at ive a n al ys i s consid er s t he organizati on of the company such as the management board of the company the companyês size, the nature of the product, the diversification of the product, and economies of scale of the company. Quantitative analysis focuses on the financial statements of the company and transforms them into various measurements such as Earning per Share \(EPS\, the ratio of price and book value \(P/BV\, Return on Equity \(ROE\, and Return on Assets \(ROA\1 Technical analysis uses the historical data of daily trading including stock prices and buying or selling stock volume to predict the trends of stock prices in the future presented by graphs. The examples of these graphs are Moving Average Convergence Divergence \(MACD\, Exponential Moving Average \(EMA\, and Relative Strength Index \(RSI\ [1 The objective of this paper is to propose an application of association rule mining for discovering the relationships between individual stocks based on Thai stock market. The advantage of this work is to preliminary help investors to find the interesting stocks for buying or selling The organization of this paper is as follows: Section II reviews the existing works applied on Thai stock market Section III explains the theory of an association rule mining technique, Section IV describes the data preprocessing step of the application, Section V discusses about association rules for stock trading, and Section VI provides the conclusion of this work  II  R ELATED W ORKS  There are many works applied data mining techniques for Thailand stock market. All of these researches used various factors that influence the Thai stock market as the inputs of the models and predicted the Stock Exchange of Thailand \(SET index Rimcharoen et al. [2 o p osed an ada ptive eval u ati o n  strategy for predicting the SET index.

This research compared the prediction performance of the three models: 3-layer, 4-layer, and 5-layer neural networks. The inputs of the models are same which consists of seven nodes: the SET index, the Dow Jones index, the Nikkei index, the Hang Seng index, the gold price, the MLR, and the exchange rates of the Thai Baht and the US dollar In 2010, Sutheebanjard and prechaiswadi d the 3-layer neural networks to forecast the SET index. The number of input nodes is seven which are the SET index, the Dow Jones index, the Straits Times index, the Nikkei index the Hang Seng index, the MLR, and the gold price  As mention above, all of researches used various data mining techniques to predict the SET index only, none of 259 


works provides the relationships between stocks. Since in Thai market, there are hundreds of individual stocks, it is important for stock investors to know which stocks are related in order to make a better decision to buy or sell suitable stocks. For this reason, this paper aims to discover the relationships between interesting stocks based on an association rule mining technique  III  A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING  Association rule mining is a useful technique for discovering correlation among items. It was first introduced for market basket analysis [6 r ent ly th er e ar e  m a ny applications in various fields using association rule technique to extract information such  as transportation edi ca l  8  traffi web m i n ing 10], sport  1 1  12    and cr i m e an a l y s is 13   Let I={i 1 i 2 i 3 be a set of literals called items and let the database consist of a set of transactions. An association rule has the form X  Y where X  I, Y  I, and X  Y  X is called antecedence and Y is called consequence of the rule There are two important measures used to select the interesting association rules support  sup nd confidence   conf  Support is the percentage of transactions containing both X and Y Confidence is the percentage of transactions containing X that also contain Y A process of the association rule mining is generating all interesting rules that satisfy the user-specified minimum support  minsup  minimum confidence  minconf ere are two steps in association rule mining. First, finding all frequent itemsets that satisfy minsup Next, generating association rules from these frequent itemsets that satisfy minconf   Sometimes a rule X  Y is considered to interesting with a high support and confidence, but this rule can be misleading since the occurrence of X does not imply the occurrence of Y Thus the correlation between itemsets X and Y will be considered. The measurement for evaluating an association rule based on the correlation is called the lift  lift of a rule X  Y can be computed by \(1  1  There are three types of the correlation from the lift value  If the                    , then the occurrence of X and Y are negatively correlated  If the                    , then the occurrence of X and Y are positively correlated  If the                     , then X and Y are independent  IV.   D ATA P REPROCESSING   The original datasets for generating the association rules were obtained from www.kimeng.co.th. These datasets are historical daily data covered the period from 4 January 2010 to 30 December 2010. An example of an original dataset is shown in Table 1 Each dataset is represented to an individual stock, and a row of the dataset consists of nine columns including, date daily opening, high, low, and closing price, change \(means the difference of closing price between today and previous day the percentage of change, trading volume, and trading value of that stock In data preprocessing step, the original data were transformed to the format of transactional data in order to find the association rules  An example of a transactional dataset is shown in Fig.1. Each transaction represents a daily trading information which containing all individual stocks which have risen or fallen more than or equal to a particular percentage over the previous dayês close. An individual stock is encoded by adding a letter çié or çdé in front of a name of that stock For an example, çiADVANCé \(çdADVANCé\means today the price of the ADVANC stock rises \(falls\when compared with yesterday  V.   A SSOCIATION R ULES F OR S TOCK T RADING   In the experiments, three transactional datasets were generated using three different values of the percentage of change: 1%, 2%, and 3%. After three transactional datasets were constructed, an association rule mining technique was applied to find the association rules separately for each dataset. For the support-confidence framework, the minsup was set to 10%, 5%, and 3% according to the datasets which have 1%, 2%, and 3% of change respectively. For the minconf  it was set to 100% for all datasets Table 2 shows the number of discovered association rules the minimum and the maximum support value from all generated rules. The results reveal that when the percentage of change is set to high the generated rules will have low supports In addition, there are a few rules can be found. On the contrary, if the percentage of change is set to low i.e. 1 the discovered rules will have higher supports This is because TABLE I  THE  O RIGINAL  D ATASET  OF T HE  ADVANC  S TOCK   Fig.1. The transactional dataset         Y P X P Y X P lift Y X    1   Y X lift 1 012  Y X lift 1   Y X lift 260 


 in a real dataset, the individual stocks \(items risen/fallen more than or equal to 3% are rarely appeared in a transaction. Thus the  minsup should be set to a low value  minsup 3%\n order to prevent the problem of finding none of rule The top five association rules ranked by the lift the supports and the lifts of the rules for each dataset \(a group of the percentage of change\mmarized in Table 3. The sets of association rules from Table 3 indicate the relationship among the trend of individual stock values. These sets of rule are different depended on the dataset and the minsup   The rule {iKEST, iAMATA  iASP means if the KEST and the AMATA increase more than 3%, then the ASP will rise more than 3% too. The discovered rules may help stock investors to make a decision which stocks should buy or sell together. Furthermore, these rules may use to predict a trend of an interested stock \(stock appeared in a consequence of a rule\ by considering the rule that has an antecedent set of stock matching to a current situation of stock market Since there are three difference sets of association rules according to a certain percentage of change of a stock price, in practice, stock traders should select an interesting rule from a group of an acceptable price change. As an example, if an investor aims to buy or sell a stock when a stock price is changed more than or equal to 2% the investors should consider the rules in a group of 2% of change     VI.   C ONCLUSION   This paper applied an association rule mining technique to discover the relationship between a set of individual stocks. In the data preprocessing step, a percentage of change of each stock was considered to eliminate the stock which has a percentage of change smaller than a specified value. In the experiment, three transactional datasets of 242 trading days were used to find the sets of association rules with three specified minsup values and 100% of minconf  In conclusion, this application helps beginner stock traders to recommend interesting stocks by using the set of generated association rules. Furthermore, the rule can predict a trend of a consequence stock related to the stocks appeared in an antecedence of the rule. However this application can suggest some interesting stocks and a trend to buy or sell for that stock, it should be better if stock investors consider this information together with the other factors such as the SET index, a fundamental of an interested stock, or technical graphs in order to make a final decision for buying or selling a good stock  R EFERENCES  1 W.

Based on this ch aracteristic,  in the general file system design document subparagraph \(File Stripping\ and file cache distributed storage strategy. Sub-media files will be stored on multiple servers can improve overall system performance, easier to achieve the various storage load balancing between nodes u ch as Fi gure 2 System of certain docume nts frequent high level visits, which is far greater than some of the other. Of all the server systems to save copies of all the documents is a simple, wo rkable solution, it is clear that the larger overhead, the pr ogram for the visit to the probability of a number of relatively small document is a waste of resources. To this end, the design of a redundancy document st orage strategy 1.x Through the above-mentioned data mining [7 a  result, it is not difficult to analyze statistics and are frequently accessed files. Based paper was the number of visits per hour for the frequency of visits recorded for the frequency of visits then if the larg er, is illustrated in these documents is to visit "hot spots" can be copied to mu ltiple servers. According to the frequency of visits to adjust the location of documents, making each server is basically the same value. This will not app ear on a server to store all the files are often visited, an d other servers on the file access probability are smaller. Monitor regularly get each server load, if we find that the value of comparison between the differences in wealth will start a process of adjusting the distribution of documents. For performance considerations, such adjustment can not in real time i f N i 1 i File _ N i i f 1 i f i f  EXPERIMENTAL AND TESTING   First of all, describe the experimental environment, a number of data files were ra ndomly distributed in more than one server, the documents themselves in terms of logic there is no correlation. In order to closer to the real application environment, using about 3-5M compressed audio files stored on each server 100 Using Python language write multi-threaded server program. The main process are responsible for monitoring the request, if a re quest arrived, then start a new thread for a subset of services, continue to monitor the main process. Services sub-threads through the link to read the overall table and buffer table documents on request information and the current server status information, and then give a response in accordance with the algorithm The client can be taken two ways to simulate the real visit farmers. One is by reading a document linked to triple, to be a need to access the documents, as well as the probability of the vis it. Subsequently, the client through a random proces s to the probability of access to files to the probability ij p  ij p j f 1  of random access a file. Another way what access to the real record of real farmer, to reproduce in the experiment, so as to achieve the purpose of the visit simulation farmers  5.1 ASSOCIATED DATA STRUCTURE  Triples visit to describe the current list of documents most likely continue to visit the next visit to the transfer of documents and its probability. Such linkages in the real environment will be to get through data mining and production, in other words, the purpose of data mining and the result is to generate and update the list of triples      ij j i p f f Am ong them is the representative of the current vi sit of the document is on behalf of most likely to vi sit a paper document is on behalf of the visit  followed the probability of accessing files Table 3 bel ow shows an example i f j f p ij i f j f File i File j Pij File_SVR_01_01 File_SVR_02_01 0.8 File_SVR_01_02 File_SVR_02_02 0.7 File_SVR_01_03 File_SVR_02_03 0.6  Table 3 File association Triples

5.2  B UFFER POOL DATA STRUCTURE  In order to more effectively manage the buffer zone we need to know what documents have been read into the buffer zone, the proportion of these documents and whether space is being used, such as basic information The definition of the following data structure used to describe the use of the buffer zone Algorithm 2 buffer class definition START class BufferPool def __init__ \(self  self.lock  threading.Lock   Mutex Semaphore self.pool  buffe r pool  def addToBuffer \(self, file\d into the buffer content self.lock.acquire \(\# critical region began  bufferBlock = \( 'name': filename, 'size': size, 'bytes bytes,' reference ': 0 File name, buffer size, the contents of the documents, citing a number of  self.lock.release \(\# end of critical region def readFromBuffer \(filename\ove the buffer content def isInBuffer \(filename\determine the file exists in the buffer zone END Each file is read into the buffer zone after which a new Buffer Block, in accordance with the above approach to the basic information into a buffer with Ikegami added. When the file is accessed by traversing the entire sequence can be informed of whether the document had been read into the buffer zone also need to modify the number of f iles, record the number of requests are visiting. Above modification and maintenance process between the mutually exclusive in order to control complicate d, we should introduce a semaphore mechanism, making all the modifications to the list of operations to keep pace 5.3  A NALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  Local tests, trials in this group, the client is located in a number of random requests for files on local disk the client records from the re quest sent to a file to receive the end of time interval. Tests were carried out twice, the first is not to take any strategy,  the second test is in the deployment of these strategies carried out by the server. Client, resp ectively, simulated 10 threads 20 threads, 30 threads, 40 threads and 50 concurrent threads on the circumstances. Abscissa in Figure 3 that the number of simultaneous threads, t hread-ordinate that the average response time. At the top of the curve is the first test results, the bottom of the curve is the result of the second test   Figure 3 results contrast map   From the data that the visit has not been preprocessing the request, with the concurrent degree of improvement in performance is obvious; and after a visit to the request of the forecast, the performance improved significantly 512M memory in a server network bottlenecks in the neglected cases, at the same time can support more than 20 concurrent requests, the numerical main memory size limit The next test of this group is in a real network environment, the client in accordance with the mining algorithm to sim u late the res u lts obtained acces s and the results compared with the random test algorithm. In this exper iment, the client simulated multicast mechanism, by reading a list of servers, each server to request the corresponding port. In practice this will be multicast protocols and multicast routers to achieve. Taking into account the request packet size compared with the response for the message can be ignored, so that the alternativ e test results will not be a visible impact. Experimental specific steps are below such as algorithm 3 3 Simulation Algorithm Client Access Step 1 client read associated ternary group, read the file list at the same time Step 2 program were randomly selected from a list of files in the document as a starting point to visit, a request to all servers Step 3 Process will read the list of associated tuples corresponding value, through a random process to the probability of visit tuples na med in a docu ment to the probability of random access a file Step 4 Repeat the process until the time they reach the required value, the end of the visit Figure 4 2 Gaussian curve representing the strategies mentioned in this article and random strategy to respond to the mean and variance, abscissa on behalf of the average probability density longitudinal coordinates
