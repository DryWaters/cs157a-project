Abstract 
In the context of processing high volumes of data the recent developments have led to numerous models and frameworks of distributed processing running on clusters of commodity hardware On the other side the Graphics Processing Unit GPU has seen much enthusiastic development as a device for general-purpose intensive parallel computation In this paper 
we propose a framework which combines both approaches and evaluates the relevance of having nodes in a distributed processing cluster that make use of GPU units for further ne-grained parallel processing We have engineered parallel and distributed versions of two data mining problems the naive Bayes classiìer and the

tance in our society The data generated by our interactions is used to conduct business decisions or inîuence our interactions with services Take for example the Recommended Products section of an online shopping website or the People you may know recommendation of a social network All these features consume high volumes of data and require fast computations in order to provide the user with relevant information and accurate recommendations as soon as fresh information about the user is available The past years have seen the development of generalpurpose computing on Graphics Processing Units GPU At a similar cost a GPU can theoretically as of today deliver more parallel computing performance than a traditional CPU 
However programming with GPUs often requires to delve into speciìc device code CUDA OpenCL and low-level hardware considerations such as memory allocation bank selection and memory access patterns Many libraries however such as Thrust 1  present a higher-level abstraction of the device-speciìc concepts and provide primitives for programming on the GPU These implement the best practices and programming patterns in order to use the GPU in general purpose computing There also exist libraries which are specifically developed for problems in the elds of signal processing image processing or data mining All these existing libraries provide solutions for writing code running on a machine 
equipped with one or more GPUs and are focused on the complexity of the algorithms rather than the volume of data being processed 1 Thrust http://thrust.github.io In parallel to this the recent advances in Cloud Computing and Big Data processing have led to the development of distributed and parallel programming models as Googleês  and other frame w orks based on the more general DataFlow Graph model such as Nephele[3 and AR These frame w orks allo w to launch distrib uted parallel data processing jobs on high volumes of data Numerous reports have already evaluated the performance and scalability of the programming models supported by many of 
these frameworks 6 In this work we propose a framework suited for data mining combining the distributed execution model of the aforementioned frameworks with the power of the GPUs available on the individual computing nodes This adds a second level of parallelization as the job can be scheduled in parallel on the nodes of the cluster and each node will execute its routine using parallel primitives of its equipped GPU As a means to demonstrate the framework and the execution model we have developed a version of the naive Bayes classiìer and the k-Means clustering algorithm which both make use of the distributed cluster setup and the massive parallel computation power provided by the GPU on the nodes To our knowledge 
no existing framework has so far combined the distributed processing approach with the parallel processing power of individual nodes The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents the related work and the motivations behind the project Section 3 presents the architecture of the framework Section 4 details the algorithms that run on the framework Section 5 and 6 discuss the test results on the two implemented use cases Section 7 outlines our insights about the integration of our framework model to existing DFG processing models and nally Section 8 concludes our work II R ELATED W ORK 
Paralellizing and distributing the implementation of the data mining techniques has proven to be an effective solution when dealing with high volumes of data The main principle is to speed up the data mining operations by adding more machines to the cluster rather than modifying the algorithm with complex and nely selected optimizations Many of the classical data mining algorithms can be parallelized and distributed by building a local model on each node and then combining these models together to form the global model has performed a surv e y on the parallelization and the complexity of some of the most used data mining

algorithms including k-NN decision trees naive Bayes kmeans PageRank SVM LDA and CRF This concept can be pushed further and generalizes the principle as   This refers to the form of the algorithm where the data is divided into as many pieces as there are cores and each core processes the equation over its share of data The individual results are nally aggregated at the end to form the global result Many data mining algorithms fall under this model and can be implemented with the MapReduce paradigm Recently the same kind of concept has also been applied to the distributed training of the structured perceptron in which each perceptron individually trains on a disjoint subset of the data and eventually the nal parameters of the model are set to a weighted mixture of the parameters of each model The GPU on the other hand has also proven to be relevant for data mining operations such as means clustering Monte Carlo simulations similarity joins and itemset mining Numerous studies have shown signiìcant speedups of these operations over their CPU implementations 11 12  14 There also e xist libraries speciìcally designed to solve particular problems in numerical simulation of uids signal and image processing In data mining projects such as and 14 ha v e de v eloped libraries which implement optimized machine learning algorithms for running on a single node where at least one GPU is available Most of the existing studies on data mining on GPU only focus however on the speedup gained from the computation on GPU compared to the CPU implementation sometimes with multiple GPUs equipped on the same machine None so far has explored the setup where distributed nodes in a cluster are each equipped with a GPU compute capable device This particular setup presents two levels of parallelism provided rst by the distributed nature of the cluster and secondly by the parallel processing abilities of the GPU device equipped on the nodes Both levels of parallelism are distinct and require speciìc engineering of the algorithm to run distributed and to harness the individual parallel processing power on the nodes Furthermore special care should even be addressed when developing an algorithm for the GPU from an existing sequential design as a bad parallel implementation can lead to worse performance Finally this setup also raises additional challenges on the scheduling as it also has to take into account the individual compute capabilities of the nodes III A RCHITECTURE OF THE F RAMEWORK In this study we propose a framework that enables the execution of data processing tasks in a distributed setup and that takes into account the compute capabilities of the GPU hardware that is available on each node The framework is suited for running data processing algorithms composed of the following phases 1 Independent computation of a partial model on disjoint data chunks 2 Combination of the partial models into the global model  Fig 1 Architecture of the framework Each worker node is equipped with a compute-capable GPU Steps 3 nodes register to the node They each receive instructions about their respective role as well as all the job information and cluster conìguration The worker nodes will get information from the master about the data chunks they will work on and the location of the subsequent node We consider that the data is stored in a distributed fashion over the worker nodes so that each worker only needs to load and work on data that is already locally present and does not require a transfer of data through the network This can be achieved by using a distributed lesystem with a sharding policy such as HDFS 2  This architecture is much similar to the MapReduce model each individual worker can be seen as executing a map task and the combiner performs a reduce task over the outputs of the map tasks with the exception that the workers are not limited to run only map tasks but can execute any complex task even potentially a full MapReduce or DFG job as will be discussed later The framework provides the signalling mechanism for the communication between the nodes and the different roles IV A LGORITHMS In order to demonstrate the framework we have engineered two classical machine learning algorithms to run on the framework the naive Bayes classiìer and the means clustering algorithm In this section we describe these algorithms and discuss the required considerations when developing algorithms for this framework The reengineering covers two phases rst the algorithm needs to be data-parallel consisting in a phase where the same 2 Apache Hadoop FileSystem http://hadoop.apache.org

algorithm is applied on different nodes on different chunks of data with the individual results merged at the end Secondly the data-parallel phase of the algorithm running on the workers needs to be designed in a way such that the parallel computing power on the GPU is harnessed The naive Bayes classiìer is an important supervised classiìcation method based on the Bayes theorem and which assumes that the presence of a feature in a class is independent of any other feature The method however also shows good performance even in the case of strong dependencies Let the training set of data containing instances in classes each instance is represented as a feature vector associated with a class label  The general case of the naive Bayes classiìer is described as follows 1 Estimate from the proportion of instances of class in  2 Estimate  In the case is a continuous variable a common strategy is to assume that follows a Gaussian distribution Otherwise if is categorical then the estimation can be done by counting the fraction of records where and Given a new object  the prediction of its class is given by the following computation The parallelization of the naive Bayes classiìer is straightforward Given a cluster of nodes the set can be partitioned into distinct shards each assigned to a node Each node computes the distribution of on its training instances Assuming Gaussian distributions each node in practice computes the mean and the variance of each feature for each class in the case of continuous variables The means and variances computation operation is highly parallelizable and can make use of the GPU compute capabilities on the node The means and variances are computed individually by each node using a parallel summation reduction and transformation both performed highly in parallel by the GPU on the workers These then need to be combined from all the nodes to provide the means and variances of the distributions on the whole dataset We use the combined variance method to sum up the partial means and variances results where is the mean the variance the number of partitions the size of the shard and the total number of data Algorithms 1 and 2 summarize the routines executed on the workers and the combiner Distributed Naive Bayesian Classiìer Worker Routine 1 Read data from local data partition in GPU memory classes in features Compute Mean on GPU 5 Compute Variance on GPU 6 Distributed Naive Bayesian Classiìer Combiner Routine 1 Receive model parts and from all the workers 2 classes features Combine means from Combine variances from The means clustering algorithm is a cluster analysis method which partitions observations into clusters with each observation belonging to the cluster with the nearest mean Concretely given a set of data points in such as  the problem is to nd points in such that the following measure is minimized where is the distance usually the Euclidian distance between and  The points are known as the  In short the problem can be summarized as nding cluster centroids such that the average squared Euclidian distance or Mean Squared Error MSE between a data point and its nearest centroid is minimized We base our implementation of the means algorithm on the distributed version proposed by in which the initial data set is partitioned among all the working nodes Each node then receives the same set of initial centroids and performs the means iterations on its share of data At the end of each iteration the updated centroids positions and the number of data points belonging to each cluster are gathered by the combiner in order to globally update the positions of the centroids The iterations performed by the means algorithm are all data-intensive operations which can be congruently parallelized on the GPU device At each iteration the following steps are performed 1 Compute the distance of each data point to each of the centroids 2 For each data point determine its closest centroid and keep a count of the number of data points related to each centroid

3 Update each centroid with the coordinates from its related data points Each of the aforementioned steps can be designed as a parallel operation to be run on the GPU The rst step can be implemented as a parallel transformation followed by a summation reduction of all the data points for each centroid in the same way as step 3 Using the row-major representation of 2D data we are able to make use of the performant access patterns on GPUs such as coalesced accesses and perform step 2 without the need to perform a costly matrix permutation Algorithms 3 and 4 summarize the steps taken by the worker and the combiner Distributed means Worker Routine 1 Read data from local data partition in GPU memory 2 Set Receive centroids from combiner 5 centroids Compute all Identify index of centroid closest to Increment count number of matched centroid 10 Sum all for to its closest Contribute each coordinates to its matching  and to get response from Distributed means Combiner Routine 1 Generate initial centroids Large number 3 and to the workers 5 Receive model parts  and from all workers 6 to the workers C General Case In the two previous use cases we have taken two dataparallel algorithms and have engineered them to run on our framework We will discuss here the general requirements of any algorithm that will run on the framework in order to optimally exploit this processing model 1 Data-parallelism The framework offers two layers of parallelism the rst layer is at the worker level with the distributed nodes in the cluster and the second is at the processing level on each worker thanks to the parallel compute capabilities of GPU devices In order to t the framework the algorithm should be data-parallelizable This basically means that the outcome of the algorithm should be identical whether it is applied to a single block of data or on disjoint chunks of the data then combined back Algorithms that t the MapReduce or DFG model as discussed in Section 2 fall under this requirement In our framework each worker has to compute a local model based on the same algorithm but applied to its local data chunk In the naive Bayes classiìer use case each worker computes the means and variances of the features and the probability of each class on its own dataset In the means use case each worker performs a full means iteration based on the data points in its local set 2 GPU parallel processing The previous step then needs further engineering as these local computations will make use of the GPU compute devices By experience this step requires a full rethinking of the way the algorithm works in order to design an algorithm which beneìts from the power of parallel computing on GPU taking into account the details and characteristics of GPU programming A straight transposition of the algorithm to run on the GPU will often lead to very poor and even worse performance This is the phase that requires the most engineering at least at the time being with the current state of the GPU development tools 3 Model outcome The nal step is to identify how the nal outcome of the model can be obtained as the combination of each of the partial model produced by the individual workers In the naive Bayes classiìer use case the outcome of the model consists of means and variance values These are combined together from the individual workers partial models thanks to the combined means and variances method In the means use case the intermediate counts of the number of data points belonging to a centroid are saved in order to compute the nal position of the centroids based on the intermediate results of the workers V T EST AND R ESULTS The framework has been tested against the distributed naive Bayes classiìer and the distributed k means clustering algorithms detailed in the previous section Both use cases have been tested with the KDD Cup 1999 Data Set 3 with various levels of Gaussian noise added in order to inîate the total volume of data from the initial 0.6Gb to 7.2Gb The dataset contains raw TCP connection information over a U.S Air Force LAN Each connection presents 41 features 32 continuous  9 discrete and is labeled as normal or as a network attack with exactly one attack type for a total of 23 classes The data mining task is to build a model for the classiìcation of connections into these classes Note that we are here interested in measuring the performance of the computation of the global model which purpose is to illustrate the use cases of the framework rather than the performance and precision of the constructed models All tests have been performed on 4 physical machines equipped with Intel i5 3550 16Gb RAM and Gigabit interconnect The GPUs used for testing include the Nvidia GTX 3 http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/KDD+Cup+1999+Data

For the computation of the naive Bayes classiìer each worker locally loads an exclusive subset of the whole dataset Each node then computes a naive Bayes classiìer on its subset of data The global model is then derived on the combiner using the combined means and variance method as described in Section 4 The computation of the local model makes use of the GPU parallel reduction algorithms Figure 2 represents the average time spent measured on one worker equipped with GTX Titan for the computation of the model in function of the dataset size each of the three workers locally processing one third of the total data size The tests on the single-node setup have not been performed on all the dataset sizes as in this implementation of the algorithm the entire dataset needs to t in the memory of the GPU First we can observe that the GPU implementation of the job takes less time to complete than its CPU counterpart The distributed GPU setup in this case offers a speedup of up to 7 compared to the computation performed distributed over three CPU workers for the largest dataset size The speedup increases with the size of the data as the overhead of setting up the GPU gets smaller with regards to the time spent on the actual processing In the distributed means use case each worker individually loads an exclusive chunk of the complete dataset then receives the set of initial centroids and performs a means iteration on it At the end of each iteration the MSE and the updated centroids are merged by the combiner Globally updated centroids are then broadcasted in return by the combiner for the next iteration if needed depending on the global value of the MSE All the data sizes could not have been tested on the single-node setup as the whole dataset partition needs to reside inside the device memory in this implementation We have run the distributed means algorithm on the dataset over 32 numerical features of the data and a value of 23 number of initial clusters Figure 3 shows the mean iteration performance on a node equipped with GTX Titan of the framework on different sizes of data Each of the three workers locally processes one third of the total data size We can observe a time speedup on average of 3.5 for the GPU version over the CPU version For the dataset sizes which can be run on a single-node we can observe that the performance is close to the three-nodes setup that only makes use of the CPU VI R ESULTS D ISCUSSION It seems important to us to stress out at this point that all the performance comparison gures concerning the computation on CPU should be taken for illustration only It would be irrelevant to compare these gures as an apples-to-apples comparison of the performance of GPU vs CPU for two reasons The rst reason is that the CPU and the GPU used in

the tests do not compete in the same category of the market To provide a fair comparison one should use hardware similarly priced and targeting the same end of the market Then in order to perform such comparison the CPU implementation should be nely engineered to make use of all the lower level specialized instruction sets such as in this case the SIMD extensions SSE as explained in Instead these gures should be considered with the context of distributed processing frameworks as background What we want to highlight is the performance gain when for a same job and given a cluster of distributed processing nodes some nodes are equipped with a GPU and run a GPU-optimized implementation of the job And within this scope the results show a considerable performance gain of the compute nodes when they make use of the parallel processing power of the GPU for massive data-parallel tasks This adds a second level of speedup and parallelization to the already distributed nature of the compute cluster Concerning the data transfer which is often considered an inconvenient when working with GPUs we have observed that under the right conditions e.g when using memory representations that ts the GPU programming models such as row or column-major representations the majority of the PCIe 2.0 and 3.0 bandwidth 8 Gb/s and 12 Gb/s between the RAM memory and the GPU device can be leveraged in memory transfers Indeed in our tests the whole data set is rst entirely copied to RAM memory then moved to the GPU device memory The timings of these transfers are signiìcantly low and represent less than 1 percent of the total processing time In our measures lling the 6Gb of memory on the titan took less than 4 seconds This means that even in the case the whole dataset does not t into GPU memory casting it into chunks and processing them one after the other by the GPU should not signiìcantly impact the overall processing time VII E XTENSION TO THE DFG MODEL We believe that an extension of the DFG processing model of a processing framework such as AROM or Dryad to take into account GPU primitives can form a suitable platform for distributed heterogeneous computing Such platform enables users to elegantly design data processing jobs which transparently make use of regular control-intensive CPU code and data parallel GPU-enabled code In this section we will detail the required extensions to the DFG model of AROM and the implications on the rest of the framework to enable GPU related tasks The DFG model is a directed acyclic graph in which each node represents an operation and each edge represent a data dependency between operations In a DFG processing framework each of these node will be scheduled for execution on an available core and each edge represents a data transfer With this representation speciìc GPU kernel code can be encapsulated within an operator that the user can simply reuse and combine with other operators to form the nal job This permits to bundle operators which make use of the GPU for speciìc tasks into a library for the user The idea is that the user will only handle code execution on the GPU through these operators and create a job by mixing regular operators running CPU code and these operators running Fig 4 DFG representation of a job composed of two data sources preprocessing stages and a join operation whose results are fed to a GPUenabled operators stage Square nodes are operators executing code on the GPU The Dyrad-like notation of the job is also represented TABLE I GPU KERNEL TAXONOMY WITH REGARDS TO THEIR DATA TRANSFER DEPENDENCE  ACCORDING TO  Kernel category Description Non-Dependent ND The kernel does not depend on data transfer with the GPU or the dependence is extremely small Dependent Streaming DS The kernel is dependent on data transfer with the GPU but this is hidden by streaming transfer Single-Dependent-Host-to-Device SDH2D Kernel depends on data transfer to GPU Single-Dependent-Device-to-Host SDD2H Kernel depends on data transfer from the GPU Dual-Dependent DD Kernel depends on data transfer from and to the GPU parallel GPU code Figure 4 depicts such a job An additional advantage to this is that an operator can bundle higher-level primitives enforcing the best practices and patterns of GPU programming for example reduce functions sort convolutions and transformations The scheduler of the framework would need to take into account the fact that some of the operators need to run code on GPU and map this to the GPU capability of the nodes in the cluster A same operation for example can be implemented in two different versions one using the CPU and the other using the compute capabilities of the GPU At runtime the scheduler will dynamically decide to run one version or the other depending on the capabilities of the available hosts This will require to annotate an operator in the job graph to reîect the GPU-dependent nature of the operator or deìne a new type of nodes in complement to the existing types The scheduler will also need to give higher priority to data locality in the case of GPU operators as the data transfer to the GPU device can represent an additional overhead in the job The scheduling of the operators should amortize this transfer time by scheduling the subsequent operators which make use of the data present in the GPU memory on the same physical node to eliminate the data transfer between GPUs of different nodes Moreover the scheduler could use hints on the data dependency of the operators in order to optimize their scheduling For example proposes a taxonomy for GPU jobs with regards to the dependency on memory transfer between the host and the GPU Table I Finally the DFG model has been known for being suitable to implement a higher-level query language on top of the framework AROM and Stratosphere for example have a Pig interpreter which translates the Pig query execution plan into

a DFG job Queries involving sorts joins merges are translated into a DFG job and executed on a dataset With regards to what we said above parts of these queries can be executed on the GPU using the correct operators This can lead a step closer to GPU-ofîoaded database processing such as described in and 20 VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have presented a distributed processing framework suited for data mining whose computing nodes make use of the parallel processing power of GPUs to tackle data-parallel tasks This framework falls under the context of DFG distributed processing frameworks such as AROM Dryad and Stratosphere to which its contribution is to show that on data-parallel jobs performance can be gained by equipping the worker nodes with GPU compute enabled devices We have highlighted the signiìcant performance gain on two datamining problems the naive Bayes classiìer and the means clustering that we have engineered to run distributed and to use the parallel processing from the GPU We believe that combining the best of both worlds the distributed nature of the processing framework and the individual parallel computing abilities of the nodes provided by the GPU can add much value and form a suitable platform for distributed heterogeneous processing in the future R EFERENCES  J Dean and S Ghema w at MapReduce Simpliìed Data Processing on Large Clusters in
