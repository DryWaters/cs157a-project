algorithms to provide 6 degree of freedom 6DOF relative pose information in realtime The TriDAR triangulation  LIDAR sensing technology combines triangulation and Time-of-Flight ToF active ranging techniques within the same optical path This configuration takes advantage of the complementary nature of these two imaging technologies and allows the system to provide fast and accurate 3 dimensional data at both short and long range In partnership 
with the Canadian Space Agency CSA Neptec has developed a novel object localization algorithm that calculates the relative pose of a target spacecraft without requiring an initial estimate of the pose This algorithm will be used to automatically initiate the model based tracking process and recover if tracking is lost The technique was specifically designed for real-time operations in space where a target spacecraft could be tumbling and 
processing power is limited Most traditional approaches to object recognition and pose estimation algorithms require high resolution data arranged in a grid such that convolution based operators can be used This generally means that data acquisition is slow and real-time data processing requires a powerful computer Neptec's approach follows the More Information Less Data MILD paradigm It requires only a unorganized sparse 3D point cloud of the target keeping 
the data acquisition time to a minimum This paper"2 presents an overview of the overall tracking system as well as results from testing the localization algorithm The algorithm was tested with both simulated and TriDAR sensor data TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION 1 2 VISION SYSTEM OVERVIEW 2 3 APPROACH To OBJECT LOCALIZATION 3 1 11-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

Space Station ISS video cameras to compute the relative poses of ISS modules for assembly Figure 1 1 Figure 1 Space Vision System SVS install view The Advanced Video Guidance Sensor AVGS uses an active imager with a set of retro-reflectors mounted on the target spacecraft to compute the relative pose during rendezvous and docking operations 2 While reliable target based systems have operational limitations as targets must 
be installed on payloads to track This is not always practical or even possible 8 Recent developments in 3D sensing technologies and computer vision at Neptec have led to a high Technology Readiness Level TRL vision system that can be used reliably onorbit for relative navigation without requiring cooperative targets 3],[4 The system combines a TriDAR triangulation  LIDAR 3D active sensor with Neptec's 1 


3DLASSO model based tracking software Using only knowledge about the target geometry and 3-dimensional data acquired from the sensor the system computes the 6 Degree Of Freedom 6DOF relative pose directly Realtime performance has been achieved by implementing a smart scanning strategy referred to as More Information Less Data MILD where only the necessary data to perform the pose estimation is acquired by the sensor This strategy minimizes the required data acquisition time data bandwidth memory and processing power In order to initialize the tracking system or recover if tracking is lost a separate process is required Traditional object localization techniques such as spin images 5 or geometric hashing 6 rely on organized high resolution 3D data and are not practical for real-time applications such as rendezvous and docking especially when considering the processing platform constraints This paper presents a novel object localization technique developed by Neptec in partnership with the Canadian Space Agency CSA under the Space Technologies Development Program STDP As opposed to traditional solutions to the general object localization problem this algorithm provides a specific solution to on-orbit localization while considering the associated operational constraints Using the same MILD approach as used for the tracking algorithm the localization technique developed requires only a sparse unorganized 3D point cloud to efficiently determine the relative pose Section 2 presents an overview of Neptec's relative navigation sensor solution Section 3 highlights Neptec's approach to solving the object localization problem Section 4 details the polygonal aspect hashing technique developed Finally section 5 presents results from testing of the localization algorithm 2 VISION SYSTEM OVERVIEW Neptec's relative navigation vision system combines a TriDAR active 3D sensor with the 3DLASSO model based tracking software 3 4 7 It provides 6 Degree of Freedom DOF relative pose information in real-time from 3D sensor data TriDAR Sensor The TriDAR sensor combines triangulation and Time-of-Flight ToF active ranging techniques within the same optical path This configuration takes advantage of the complementary nature of these two imaging technologies and allows the system to provide fast and accurate 3-dimensional data at both short and long range 7 By multiplexing the two subsystem's optical paths the TriDAR can provide the functionalities of two 3D scanners into one compact package Figure 2 The two imaging subsystems also share the same control and x-mirror ToF detector triangulation  beam expander LIDAR expander beam Figure 2 TriDAR Sensor top and optical configuration bottom processing electronics thus providing further savings compared to using two separate sensors Furthermore the TriDAR design is largely based on the Laser Camera System LCS active triangulation scanner used to perform inspection of the Space Shuttle's Thermal Protection System TPS 9 Therefore most of the system is already space qualified By combining high accuracy short range imaging with the capabilities of long range LIDAR 3D imaging in a single package the TriDAR is a sensor of choice for numerous space applications such as rendezvous  docking planetary navigation and landing site inspection material classification and vehicle inspection A single TriDAR could be used to perform several of these operations within a single mission thus providing significant hardware savings For rendezvous and docking applications The TriDAR presents advantages compared to other types of sensors To start the TriDAR can be used for both short and long range parts of a mission It can provide the data accuracy and speed necessary for the critical short range docking phase while still providing the long range capability required for 2 


the approach phase Also since the LIDAR imaging subsystem of the TriDAR can be used over the entire operational range it increases the robustness by providing redundant range measurements to augment the triangulation data used during final approach It can also be used to fill in missing data A novel feature of the triangulation optical configuration of the TriDAR is that it provides natural signal attenuation as range decreases This effectively increases the dynamic range of the sensor and prevents saturation of the detection electronics at short range Furthermore the TriDAR is a random access scanner meaning that it can scan only the area of interest in its field of view directly It does not need to acquire data in a raster scan pattern As will be discussed later this enables computer vision strategies following the More Information Less Data MILD paradigm Using this smart scanning strategy the sensor is commanded to only acquire the data necessary to extract the high level information desired in this case the 6DOF relative pose This concept is essential for enabling real-time 3D computer vision on flight hardware 3DLASSO Tracking Software 3DLASSO is fully portable sensor independent model based tracking software library 3 The tracking algorithm uses a 3D reference model of the target along with a sparse point cloud from any 3D sensor to compute the 6 Degree Of Freedom DOF relative pose in real-time No cooperative targets such as retro reflectors are required on the target object The shape of the target is typically obtained from CAD models but could also be generated from sensor data directly 8 The basic concept comes from previous research at Neptec which demonstrated that high resolution raster scan 3D data is highly redundant when used to extract high level information from a scene It was shown that only a few 3D points are necessary to not only calculate the pose of an object but also to recognize it from a set of potential candidates 10],[11 This follows the logic that differentiating objects and/or estimating their poses is mainly done by using the largest discriminating geometric features The algorithm developed for real-time tracking exploits the information contained in 3D data The technique was developed with the fundamental intent to operate directly from unorganized sparse 3D point clouds A sparse point cloud contains the most information at minimum processing cost More Information Less Data When using a random access sensor such as the TriDAR the system can directly command the sensor to acquire data from the areas of interest using an optimal scan pattern This saves significant data acquisition transfer and preprocessing time while maximizing the system pose update rate To perform the pose estimation the data obtained is aligned to the reference model of the target\(s using an innovative approach to the Iterative Closest Point ICP algorithm for real-time operations from unorganized sparse 3D data while still providing good pose accuracy It was shown that pose accuracy under 1cm  Idegree at a 5Hz update rate can be achieved on a flight processor using this technique 3 3 APPROACH To OBJECT LOCALIZATION Background Existing techniques for object localization such as spin images 5 geometric hashing 6 or others 12 generally rely on a surface feature matching process to find an object in a scene In order to extract the desired features such algorithms require evenly distributed high resolution 3D data typically arranged in a grid When trying to apply these techniques to the on-orbit rendezvous and docking scenario several problems appear Firstly acquiring high resolution 3D data can be very time consuming Scanning sensors acquire each 3D point individually and acquisition time scales with the number of points Raster scan patterns require starting and stopping of scanning mirrors thus adding even more overhead Flash type sensors can acquire an entire raster range image at once but generally have poor resolution 13 Secondly even if acquired rapidly high resolution 3D data would require longer data transfer time as well as more storage space and processing power Thirdly feature based techniques generally rely on derivative operators to calculate surface normals or curvature These are convolution operations working on neighboring voxels of a range image hence the requirement for a grid arrangement of the data This process is very time consuming and requires processing power and memory access speeds that are usually not available on flight computers Derivative operations are also very sensitive to noise and outliers To compensate another layer of time consuming data preprocessing may be required for filtering purposes Regardless these operations remain sensitive to nonGaussian artifacts such as shot noise specular reflections or edge distortions which are characteristic of most 3D sensors Development Objectives The objective of the present research is to develop a technique for object localization from 3D data that addresses the specific on-orbit localization problem The algorithm developed needs to be capable of determining the 6 DOF relative pose of a known target in the sensor field of view from 3D data without any initial guess The estimated pose will be used to initiate the 3DLASSO ICP based tracking algorithm Since ICP will be used to refine the pose estimate only a rough estimate is needed from the localization process In order to be useful for on-orbit operations the technique must overcome the following challenges  Processing power available The algorithm must be capable of operating fast enough on a flight computer to developed at Neptec This version of the ICP was tailored 3 


enable real-time operations This typically means that localization must be performed in less than a few seconds  Data acquisition and transfer time Acquiring 3D data and pre-processing it can take a significant amount of time It is therefore important that the technique be designed to minimize these factors  Active sensor noise characteristics The technique must be robust to the noise and distortion characteristics typical of 3D active sensors  Occlusions As the operating range of rendezvous and docking is quite large it is important that the system be able to operate when only part of the target is visible This typically occurs in the last portion of docking operations when the target covers more than the sensor field of view Design Approach In order to provide a real-time solution to the object localization problem the developed algorithmic approach deviates from traditional techniques It does so by focusing on the specific on-orbit localization without attempting to solve the general localization problem This allows the following simplifying assumptions  Only the target is visible I.e no segmentation is required since the object is in empty space  There is only one instance of the target object in the scene The approach developed follows these high level basic principles 1 Operate from unorganized sparse 3D point clouds directly-Neptec's approach follows the same MILD approach as the one used for the real-time tracking algorithm in 3DLASSO Using this strategy the system is designed to require only a sparse unorganized data set Thus exploiting the large amount of information contained in a comparatively small 3D point cloud It also ensures that data acquisition and post processing time is minimal while still allowing the necessary high level information to be extracted from the scene This avoids wasting time acquiring and processing data that is redundant and maximizes the use of the processing platform This strategy is essential to achieving an algorithm that executes in realtime works with the raw dataset directly and does not require computationally expensive filtering and feature extraction steps It also tends to be more robust to noise and distortions Furthermore the source data does not need to be arranged in a grid since no convolution operators will be used to extract features or filter the data 3 Fit the data to the model instead of the opposite-In general object localization algorithms are designed to find instances of a known object in a cluttered scene In the general case it makes sense to try to find the model in the scene because background clutter prohibits the opposite method In the case of finding a target object in space there is no clutter A segmentation step is therefore not required Furthermore only one instance of the target object is searched for In this specific scenario it is then possible to perform the search in the opposite direction By reversing the logic we simplify the search and accelerate the entire process 4 POLYGONAL ASPECT HASHING The technique developed for object localization is called polygonal aspect hashing It requires an offline processing step where a reference database is generated from a 3D model of the target object The run-time portion of the algorithm then uses that reference database to efficiently localize the target object in space relative to the sensor focal point The technique follows a puzzle piece fitting strategy where the data is aligned to a reference model in various poses until a best fit is obtained The difference being that in our case the pose search space has 6 dimensions In order to avoid searching the entire 6 dimensions space the algorithm first reduces the search space to the set of poses that have some overlapping surfaces between the input scan data and the reference model It does so by selecting a polygon from the input scan data and finding the poses of the target that would align the surface with this polygon Figure 3 Note that more than one polygon can be used to provide redundancy and increase the robustness to outliers Once the search space has been reduced to the most likely candidates the algorithm tests how well the data fits to the model surface at each identified poses 2 Use a point based approach-To perform the object localization task Neptec chose a point based approach over more traditional feature based techniques A point based approach finds a pose that best fits the dataset to the model where a feature based technique would match features extracted from the data to model features Feature extraction is slow and prone to errors in the presence of noise distortions and outliers A point based technique 4 


Sensor 3D Data SL p ol Selected polygobn a;;!!I Reference 3D model Match polygons  I Figure 3 Search space reduction by polygon matching Offline Processing In order to optimize the run-time part of the localization offline processing is required to generate a lookup reference database The database is composed of a fast lookup hash table that will be used to efficiently perform the polygon matching process Let M be a polygonal model of the object to localize and S a sparse set of 3D points si located on the model surface The offline processing first generates the set of all segments L\(si si that can be created on M from point pairs of S The set of segments is then arranged in a hash table that efficiently stores length and connectivity information to allow direct segment lookup with linear complexity while keeping the database compact Runtime Localization The runtime localization process uses the reference database created during the offline processing along with a sparse 3D point cloud obtained from a sensor to determine the position T and orientation R of the target model M with respect to the sensor focal point C The input point cloud I is composed of a set of n 3D points Pi defined with respect to C and that sample the surface of M The input point cloud is not expected to be organized in any specific pattern like a grid The point cloud can be sparse but should cover as much of the target as possible The first step of the algorithm is used to reduce the 6 dimensions pose search space The search space is reduced by keeping the set of poses that have at least some overlapping surface between I and M To perform this polygonal aspect graph matching is used First an N point polygon is selected from the input point cloud points Pi Selecting N is a tradeoff between processing time between each step of the localization process and can be adjusted depending on the object's geometry Typically 4 to 6 point polygons work well The points are selected to provide a polygon with a large surface area This will provide more pose determination momentum and fewer polygon matches Once a polygon is selected the set of possible poses is reduced to the poses where the polygon input scan points Pi]N line up with their corresponding model surface points Si]N within a specified tolerance Finding all the matching polygons is performed efficiently using the segment hash table generated offline Using this table the search becomes a partial tree traversal process The key to optimizing performance is to keep the reference model information sparse This will keep the number of matches small while providing a good enough pose estimate for an ICP to do the fine alignment For each polygon match a set of N matched points pi Si]N is obtained From each matched polygon pairs the corresponding relative pose T,R can be computed The points in each matched sets are assumed to represent the same physical point on the object surface within the defined tolerance Under this assumption the two sets of matched points can be related by a homogenous transformation i N R[si]N T Where T is the 3xl vector and R is the 3x3 rotation matrix representing the position and rotation of the target object with respect to the sensor focal point C The rotation matrix R and translation vector T are then found via a pseudo-inverse computation The pseudo-inverse can be calculated via singular value decomposition Once the set of pose candidates has been generated the algorithm tests them to assess how well the point cloud points Pi line up with the surface of M Figure 4 following a puzzle piece fitting strategy For each fit test the point cloud points Pi are transformed in the model reference frame using the rotation R and translation T calculated from the polygon matching process This surface alignment check has O\(n complexity where n is the number of points in the input point cloud The pose candidate that aligns the point cloud best with the surface is chosen as the solution It is also possible to increase the speed of the fit check by performing a pre-check step with a decimated dataset The efficiency of this process depends on the number of points in the input point cloud After the best fitting pose candidate has been determined it is possible to repeat the process with more polygons from the same input point cloud or to repeat the process from newly acquired point clouds over time Using either technique will increase the probability of success of the algorithm as well as increase robustness to outliers The approach to use can be selected depending on operational considerations such as relative motion rates and processing time  power available 5

success was obtained by acquiring high resolution data from the TriDAR success rate obtained using TriDAR data Very good performance is observed success rate of the algorithm increases with the number of polygons tested As would be expected the processing time also scales with the number of polygons but is only slightly affected by the target range Note that the number of points was used for simulations Figure 13 presents the even when the target is only partially visible As observed in simulations the Success Rate with TriDAR Data mean pose mean pose same as what vs Range 3-sigma processing time ms vs Range m 1000 F Figure 12 Sample point clouds obtained using the selected  500 _ n a 400 300 200 100 0 _ 4 Figure 1 Range 6 8 10 12 Range m 1 Polygon 2 Polygons 5 Polygons 14 16 18 4 Processing Time 3a of the algorithm our purposes considering the relatively low accuracy required from the localization system The criteria for pose vs Range m 20 10 0 _ Figure 11 Target Object 4 6 8 10 12 Range m 1 Polygon 2 Polygons 5 Polygons 14 16 18 Figure 13 Success Rate with TriDAR data scan patterns side view Lissajous left Rosette middle Spiral right The true relative pose used for determining pose error and localization sensor at each position and calculating the pose using an ICP algorithm This technique provides an estimate of the ground truth that is close enough for success remained the on target remained fairly constant 900-1000 throughout all these tests Table 3 shows the absolute error observed during lab testing for successful localizations The pose accuracy does not significantly improve when using more polygons but it remains well within the desired range The error observed is also consistent with simulation results Table 2 900 800 700 E a 600 E vs Table 3 Lab Testing Mean Pose Error 9 100 90 80 70 0 60 t 50 n a 30 Polygon X Y Z RotX RotY RotZ s mm mm mm deg deg deg 1 50.3 41.8 30.5 1.6 1.4 2.8 2 41.3 45.7 28.9 1.52 1.4 2.8 5 40.8 47.2 30.3 1.4 1.3 3.1 


6 CONCLUSION Neptec has developed a vision system for autonomous onorbit rendezvous and docking that does not require the use of cooperative markers on the target spacecraft The system uses an active TriDAR 3D sensor and efficient model based tracking algorithms to provide 6 degree of freedom 6DOF relative pose information in real-time The system takes full advantage of the large amount of geometric information contained in 3D data sets By following the More Information Less Data MILD paradigm where the sensor only acquires the data necessary to obtain the pose of the target real-time performance can be achieve with flight hardware Following the same smart scanning strategy Neptec has developed a novel technique for localizing a known object on-orbit The new technique called Polygonal Aspect Hashing does not require an initial guess of the relative pose and therefore can be used to initialize tracking or recover if tracking is lost Furthermore it only requires a very sparse non organized 3D point cloud thus keeping the data acquisition and pre-processing overhead to a minimum The technique follows logic similar to the process of adding a piece in a jigsaw puzzle First the set of possible positions and orientations of the scan with respect to the model is reduced to the set of poses that have sufficient overlap Once the set of poses is reduced to the most likely candidates a surface fit check is performed to determine the best matching pose The surface fit check measures the amount of overlap between an input scan and the surface of a reference 3D model of the object to find The algorithm developed was tested with both simulated and TriDAR data Results showed excellent performance and demonstrated that the algorithm works well even with very sparse input data sets as well as in the presence of sensor noise and distortions Processing time results obtained showed that real-time performance can be achieved with this technique As would be expected it was shown that the robustness can be increased by testing more polygons at the expense of processing time Another alternative would be to run the algorithm with one polygon over several sequential scans This technique would be well suited for operations where there is relative motion between the sensor and target like in a tumbling satellite scenario or if the processing power is limited In the future Neptec plans to test more objects with representative geometry and materials to further characterize the algorithm performance The effect of object symmetries will also be investigated It was observed that most failures tend to occur where the object is most symmetric Code optimization will also be performed to further improve performance 1 MacLean S Pinkney L Machine Vision in Space Can Aeronaut Space J 39\(2 63-77 1993 2 Howard Richard T Bryan Thomas C DART AVGS flight results Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp.65550L 2007 3 Ruel S English C Anctil M Church P 43DLASSO Real-time pose estimation from 3D data for autonomous satellite servicing Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 4 Ruel S English C Anctil M Daly J Smith C Zhu S Real-time 3D vision solution for on-orbit autonomous rendezvous and docking Proc SPIE Vol 6220 pp.622009 2006 5 Andrew Johnson and Martial Hebert Using spin images for efficient object recognition in cluttered 3-D scenes IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 21\(5 449 May 1999 6 H Wolfson I Rigoutsos Geometric Hashing An Overview IEEE Computational Science  Engineering 4\(4 October 1997 7 English C Zhu X Smith C Ruel S Christie I TriDAR A hybrid sensor for exploiting the complimentary nature of triangulation and LIDAR technologies Proc ISAIRAS 2005 Conference Munich Germany 5-8 September 2005 ESA SP-603 8 J Obermark G Creamer B Kelm W Wagner C Henshaw SUMO/FREND vision system for autonomous satellite grapple Proc SPIE Vol 6555 pp 65550Y 2007 9 Deslauriers A Showalter I Montpool A Taylor R Christie I Shuttle TPS inspection using triangulation scanning technology SPIE 2005 Orlando Florida April 2005 10 Ruel S English C Melo L Berube A Aikman D Deslauriers A Church P and Maheux J Field testing of a 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Orlando Florida April 12-16 2004 11 English C Ruel S Melo L Church P and Maheux J Development of a Practical 3D Automatic Target Recognition and Pose Estimation Algorithm SPIE Defense  Security Symposium Proceedings on Automatic Target Recognition XIV Orlando Florida April 2004 10 REFERENCES

After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds.
