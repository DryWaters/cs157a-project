S Yang et al  Semantic Inference on Clinical Documents Combining Machine Learning Algorithms With an Inference Engine  TABLE 7 Comparison of different classifiers used in CDTS and determine the one whose symptoms are the closest to those of the new patient at this stage and its corresponding treatment strategy is hereby applied to the patient at this stage It is of note that the treatment phase numbers of the old and new medical records might not be the same in this case Afterward the treatment phase number for the new patient is adjusted to the historical medical record's next treatment phase number Repeat Rule1 until the patient fully recovers For example a dataset  will be established when the symptoms of a new patient in the third phase do not match the historical records at the same time point Then we go through all of the records again and if any two phases of one historical record share similar symptoms with the 034rst two phases of the new patient it will be kept in   Given that any historically successful treatment 021 has m treatment phases on average the comparison procedure will be conducted C 2 m D m\050m 000 1\051  2 times at most If there are n cases then the time complexity is O\050n 003 m 2 051 This method is used to capture extended similar historical cases After the establishment of   all of the phases of the cases in  are compared with the third phase of the new patient treatment on the symptoms to 034nd the most similar one with the maximum rank at the similarity measurement matrix   which determines the treatment strategy for the new patient at the third phase C RESULTS AND ANALYSIS To enlarge the training dataset we randomly resample the dataset 1000 times without replacement by using the 034lter Resample in Weka In Table 7 iOVFDT constructs the smallest tree model compared with the other three classi\034ers in terms of the nodes leaves and depth HT and HAT also perform well in the construction of a nice tree model with 97 and 116 nodes 50 and 58 leaves and 21 and 23 depths respectively HOT has the largest tree size with more nodes and leaves which implies training dataset over\034tting As shown in Figs 8 and 9 Hoeffding-based tree classi\034ers have better performance compared to iOVFDT in terms of the classi\034cation correctness 050i.e accuracy\051 and kappa statistic 050i.e stability\051 With continuous incoming instances the accuracy and stability of Hoeffding-based tree classi\034ers rise with some 035uctuation while the performance of iOVFDT is kept at a horizontal level Similar to HAT the voted ensemble FIGURE 8 Comparison of classification correctness FIGURE 9 Comparison of the Kappa statistic FIGURE 10 Comparison of the evaluation time of the CPU multi-classi\034cation algorithm 050VEMCA\051 also performs well in terms of accuracy and stability and outperforms HAT when the number of instances is larger than 340000 Figs 10 and 11 compare the evaluation time of the CPU and the memory cost of the 034ve classi\034cation algorithms iOVFDT shows the fastest speed and the smallest memory cost among the 034ve classi\034cation algorithms HT gives better performance than HAT and HOT with 6.93 seconds in CPU occupation and a 0.91-Mb memory cost VEMCA's evaluation time and memory are 20.73 seconds and 1.62 Mb respectively VOLUME 5 2017 3543 


S Yang et al  Semantic Inference on Clinical Documents Combining Machine Learning Algorithms With an Inference Engine  FIGURE 11 Comparison of the memory cost VIII CONCLUSIONS Modern techniques such as CDSS and HIS have substantially facilitated clinical diagnosis and treatment However some of the emergent problems remain to be considered The 034rst problem is challenging the traditional data analysis techniques due to rapidly increasing amounts of multidimensional clinical data The second is the dif\034culty of clinical information integration Clinical information from different contexts are heterogeneous in terms of structure and semantics For the bene\034t of patients and long-term clinical development it is very promising to integrate clinical information 050e.g outpatients medical records\051 from different clinicians or hospitals to assist in clinical decision-making The third problem is the call for personalized medicine and professional medical treatment because different doctors or hospitals are good at diagnosing and treating different diseases and the patients have the freedom to choose among them To solve the three problems above this paper proposes a clinical diagnosis and treatment system 050CDTS\051 that assists patients in choosing clinicians or hospitals according to their requirements 050e.g distance from home to hospital\051 The foundation for disease detection in CDTS consists of decision trees that are created by our voted ensemble multiclassi\034cation algorithm that enables decision-tree-based data stream mining Furthermore to integrate clinical documents and heterogeneous health information systems a new clinical tabular document model is proposed which represents clinical documents in tabular format and maintains consistent vocabulary terms and semantic relations among different contexts through the term chain and semantic relation chain Additionally a novel semantic inference algorithm is designed for disease detection and treatment suggestion based on the rules that are generated by decision trees and similarity computations among medical records The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows 342 A uni\034ed clinical tabular document model 050CTDM\051 implemented by a new clinical tabular document language 050DocLang XML based\051 facilitates the interoperability among different clinical decision support systems 050CDSS\051 342 A new voted ensemble multi-classi\034cation algorithm is proposed in terms of running multiple decision treebased classi\034cation algorithms simultaneously on the same data stream and voting for the best output The results are associated with statistical information on the accuracy of classi\034cation which provides proof of optimization 342 A novel clinical diagnosis and treatment system with a newly designed semantic inference algorithm supports clinicians in the decision making process as well as saving time and expense for the patients For future work it is necessary to expand DocLang to become a more comprehensive markup language by importing more semantic relation types for more complex clinical documents These studies are in progress and are expected to present valuable results later REFERENCES   M A Makary and M Daniel Medical error\026The third leading cause of death in the US BMJ  vol 353 p i2139 May 2016   D Kopec M H Kabir D
