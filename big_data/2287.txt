This \nrepresents both an opportunity and challenge on different \nlevels for traditional distributed computing approaches narchitectures, and infrastructures. On the lowest level data-\nintensive computing is a challenge since CPU speed has \nsurpassed IO capabilities of HPC resources and on the \nhigher levels complex cross-disciplinary data sharing is \nenvisioned via data infrastructures in order to engage in the \nfragmented answers to societal challenges. This paper \nhighlights how these levels share the demand for 'high \nproductivity processing' of big data' including the sharing \nand analysis of 'large-scale science data-sets'. The paper will \ndescribe approaches such as the high-level European data \ninfrastructure EUDAT as well as low-level requirements narising from HPC simulations used in distributed \ncomputing. The paper aims to address the fact that big data nanalysis methods such as computational steering and \nvisualization, map-reduce, R, and others are around, but a \nlot of research and evaluations still need to be done to \nachieve scientific insights with them in the context of \ntraditional distributed computing infrastructures. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nMore and more scientific user communities share the \ndemand for new solutions for the steadily increasing \namount of scientific data that arise from scientific \ninstruments \(i.e. higher resolutions field studies \(i.e. constantly created \nreal-time datasets i.e. more \ngranular and realistic simulations nthat aim to address the aforementioned challenges and to \nprovide reasonable solutions in scientific ecosystems \(i.e. \nresearch labs, universities, shared scientific instrument \ncollaborations, etc big data’ is very vaguely defined and \ndirectly leads to a wide variety of data-driven approaches \nin commercial environments and industry rather than to \nspecific methods and scientific approaches. For instance nan often quoted definition is as follows: ‘big data is data \nthat becomes large enough that it cannot be processed \nusing conventional methods’ [1]. The question arises what \nare these ‘conventional methods’ in the particular context \nof the distributed computing community?  \nThis paper aims to survey some of these conventional \nmethods that have been used for decades in scientific \ncomputing in general and distributed computing \ninfrastructures \(DCIs aforementioned definition is \nwrong and do believe that several of the scientific \nmethods and approaches have their role to play in the \nmore and more emerging ‘big data wave’, especially \naround the requirement of ‘big data processing and \nanalysis’ what we refer to as ‘high productivity \nprocessing’ in this contribution. This refers to known \n‘conventional methods’ such as High Performance \nComputing \(HPC Computing \n\(HTC databases as well \nas available data analytics techniques \(e.g. computational \nsteering and visualization nThe reasons for the aforementioned statement will be \nunderpinned by existing solutions and by comparing the nscientific ecosystem with the current industry realm that \ntends to state that ‘big data’ solutions are available not \nonly for commercial applications, but also for scientific \nuser communities. We thus argue in this paper that the \nscientific analysis processes and its methods are different \nfrom analysing large commercial datasets that often \ninclude the analysis of log files or connection details in \norder to understand customer behaviour or to optimize \nhardware for better utilization.  \nWhile we do agree that several methods in industry are \ninteresting for scientific investigation \(e.g. the map-reduce \nmethod [2 there is still a lot of potential to apply the \nconventional methods, perhaps in a tuned and improved \nform to the challenges of the emerging ‘big data waves’ \nin science and engineering. Some scientific ‘big data napplications that we work with are given as examples for \nthe processing with conventional methods also in the ‘big \ndata’ field. \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. \nSection I introduces the problem space while Section II \noutlines the meaning and challenges of scientific data and \n‘big data waves in our DCI community. Section III then \npresents the different rather conventional ‘big data \nprocessing methods and approaches including several \nscientific application domains in context of ‘big data napplications. Section VI surveys related work in the field \nand this paper ends with some concluding remarks nMIPRO 2013, May 20-24, 2013, Opatija, Croatia\n145\nII. SCIENTIFIC DATA AS INFRASTRUCTURE \nThe DCI community with many of their institutional \nand scientific community members already analyse large-\nscale scientific data in the context of data-intensive \ncomputing since decades. The view in this community \nwas traditionally very much oriented towards computing  \n\(cf. to the DCI term 


view as stated by the high-level expert group \ndocument on scientific data: ‘Our vision is a scientific e-\ninfrastructure that supports seamlesss access, use, re-use, \nand trust of data. In a sense, the physical and technical \ninfrastructure becomes invisible and the data themselves \nbecome the infrastructure’ [4]. As a consequence, also \nother more DCI-oriented high-level bodies have written or \naddress more data related topics such as e-Infrastructure \nReflection Group \(e-IRG  e-Infrastructure Forum \(EEF  sources suggest there are a wide \nvariety of requirements and demands for data \ninfrastructures and there are many more high-level \nreports, press releases, or rather political statements that \nall share in common that the technical realisation of them \nare often rarely described. In order to derive concrete \narchitectures for data infrastructures that are able to satisfy \nthe high-level requirements, we have started in realizing a nreference model-based approach on how such \ninfrastructures look like in Riedel et al. [3], illustrated in nFigure 1. The aim of the reference model is not only to \nincrease the understanding of different stakeholders from \nvarious scientific domains with desribed entities and their \nrelationships, but also to provide ‘a point of reference to \ncompare required functionality with the functionality \nalready existing in established DCIs or scientific \ndiscipline specific data infrastructures’.  \nBefore the overall paper and later sections will go into \nmore details about these comparisons and overlaps in \ndesired and existing functionality, this section briefly \noutlines the core building blocks of the reference model \ndescribed in more detail in Riedel et al. [3]. This includes \nsome hints on how we realize one out of many possible \nderived concrete reference architectures within the \nEuropean Data Infrastructure \(EUDAT  are entities in \nthe two layers that form the ‘collaborative data \ninfrastructure \(CDI multi-disciplinary large data \ncenters with massive computational power and large \nstorage systems as well as scientific discipline-specific \ncommunity centers with data archives and moderate \ncomputational power. The aim is to federate the available \nresources among these centers and to provide a stable and \nenhanced access to unique scientific devices and large \ndata archives as shown in Figure 1 for the scientific end-\nusers. As the illustrations reveal, the reference model also \nmodels the required resources for performing ‘high nproductivity processing’ on scientific data with either \nHTC or HPC resources possibly available in both the ncommunity centers and data centers. The required \nmethods that are realized as a wide variety of ‘common \nand generic services’ are illustrated in Figure 1 as well. \nIn this context, one could argue that the architectural \ndesign of the ‘European Grid Infrastructure \(EGI  concrete roles of the EGI \nresource providers are rather generally defined as equal \nwhile in the CDI the roles are more clear and \ndistinguished from each other. The realization of the \nEUDAT CDI however points to several overlaps in \narchitectural approaches, technology requirements, and \nrequired analysis methods. There are also several overlaps \nin the architectural design with the ‘Partnership for \nAdvanced Computing in Europe PRACE  e.g. parallel file systems, etc repositories, there are also architectural and \nfunctionality overlaps with a wide variety of existing nscientific discipline-specific data infrastructures such as \nthe ‘Common  Language Resources and Technology nInfrastructure \(CLARIN  DARIAH n[11] just to list a few.   \nIn order to realize the ‘data as an infrastructure’ \nwithout ‘reinventing the wheel’ and with building on \nestablished technologies and services emerging from \nexisting aforementioned infrastructures, we outlined the \nvision of a ScienceTube [3] that federates all the added \nvalues from the aforementioned existing infrastructures \nwith an increased interlinking. The goal is that users are \nable to dive into the data’ instead of just using data \nhaving at the same time a powerful ‘virtual workspace’ \nthat they can use for scientific data analysis. As illustrated \nin Figure 1, these virtual workspaces need to have service \nadapters’ to the wide variety of established services \navailable at the community and data centers The view on \ndata itself, metadata as well as additional information such \nas clear quotas of storage, lists of community times on \nrare computing resources are core functions of the virtual \nworkspaces. The ‘list of profiles’ enable the view on data \nwith different roles and lightweight Web 2.0 features in a \nwide variety of scientific application-specific potentially \nbrowser-based ‘Virtual Research Environments \(VREs project is currently realizing parts of this \nvision and the first service ‘Safe Data Replication’ [3] is nready for production being also the basis for ‘high \nproductivity processing’ on large scientific ‘big data sets’. \nFigure 1.  Conceptual view of the data infrastructure reference model \nincluding computing resources for ‘big data’ processing [3]. \n146\nIII. BIG DATA PROCESSING METHODS & APPROACHES  \nThe previous section outlines the general reference \nmodel approach of a CDI while this section provides \ndetails on the different 


types of available conventional \nanalysis methods in the context of processing large \nscientific datasets. The fundamental goal here is to change \nthe traditional view on ‘complicated technology \(i.e. one \nspecific middleware ntechnologies \(i.e. multiple middlewares this section \naims to provide a technology-agnostic specialization on \n‘common and generic services’ that are required on both \nthe community and data centers as ‘big data processing \nand analytics services’ illustrated in Figure 2. \nA. \(Iterative  scientific especially \nin those commercial enterprises that analyze ‘big data’ of \nconsumer behavior \(e.g. phone connections just to list a few. The method is \nsimple to program with existing Java-based frameworks \nlike Apache Hadoop 11,12] by just specifying a MAP \nand REDUCE function while the framework sorts results \nof the MAP execution by using a hash function REDUCE functions can be executed in \nparallel using HTC resources to perform the specified data \nanalysis That is one of the reasons why this method can \nbe applied in community and data centers as shown in \nFigure 2. In some cases it makes sense to use MPI \nimplementations of  Map-Reduce [34] on HPC resources. \nCombining research in the field of scientific \ncomputing with the ‘Map-Reduce method’ has been \nperformed, among others by Geoffrey Fox et al. in [13]. \nThe result is a new method named as ‘Iterative Map-\nReduce’ that enhances the classic Map-Reduce’ \nalgorithm with multiple ITERATIONS of the MAP-\nREDUCE steps. This enables more applications such as \nparallel linear algebra-based solutions and can be easily \nused by existing frameworks such as Twister [14].  \nB. Scientific Workflows \nThe methods of ‘scientific workflows’ represent an \napproach of chaining different tasks for data processing or \nthe preparation of it \(e.g. transformation of data formats ninto one another nexecution’ \(i.e. on which computational resource will be \neach individual task be executed data’ \n\(i.e. which input and output data matters for the specific \ntask one or another.  \nTo provide examples of this rather conventional data \nanalysis method, the UNICORE workflow nimplementation [15] focusses on the computational \naspects as the UNICORE middleware is primarily used in nHPC-driven infrastructures \(e.g. PRACE ninfrastructures \(e.g. EGI workflow tool \nimplementation supports ‘big data’ processing especially \nin the context of parallel applications using the ‘Message \nPassing Interface \(MPI  other workflow engines that put the \nemphasis more on defining the ‘data flow’ such as Kepler \nas described in Memon and Riedel et al. [17]. Yet another \nexample of a scientific domain-specific workflow we \nworked with is the WebLicht workflow tool \nimplementation [18] used in the CLARIN infrastructure \nspecifically optimized for analyzing data in the \ncomputational linguistic fields. While there are many \nother workflow implementations the key message to take \naway is that this rather conventional data analysis method \nwill still be important in the field of ‘big data processing’. \nC. Databases \nThe use of the ‘databases method’ in the context of n‘big data processing’ often refers to image-based \napproaches. Digital \(scientific e.g. from the bio-\nmedical domain nrequired to analyze and intelligently index datasets. \nApproaches using this method often include a typical two \nphase working paradigm.  Firstly, scientific end-users of \ninfrastructures \(and their databases images and \ntheir metadata. Secondly, scientific end-users search for \nthe right datasets with images \(i.e involving metadata e.g. \nimage similarity searches rather conventional method stores metadata in \nSQL databases while the large ‘big data’ images are stored \nin file systems to which a reference is stored alongside the \nmetadata. A query about image metadata is thus nperformed with the SQL language while the analysis of \nimage contents often triggers automatic processing ntechniques \(e.g. search for most similar images to the \ninput image processing-intensive \npart can be perfectly executed on HTC resources provided \nin infrastructures such as EGI. This was shown by I. \nMontagnat in [19] taking advantage of the wide variety of \nprocessing resources in DCIs just to provide one example \nof many in the context of medical image data analysis, but \nwe argue that this method is still needed for ‘big data \nanalysis’ in the decades to come. \nFigure 2.  Conventional ‘big data’ processing methods and approaches \nin context of a service-based federated collaborative data infrastructure. \n147\nD. Massively-Parallel Processing Algorithms \nMethods of this category include many traditional \ncomputing techniques and simulations that often take \nadvantages of large-scale HPC resources 


MPI-based \nmechanisms used in parallel computing or even OpenMP \ntechniques [21] are often used in scientific applications. \nThese applications are ‘conventional’ computational \nsimulations according to known physical laws or \nnumerical methods providing solutions for approximations \nof the reality requiring a large processing power. More \nrecently input data to these scientific applications is \nsteadily growing in sizes while at the same time the output \ndata of these simulations grow as well, because \(a of the physical \nmodels and \(b resources such as the \nBlueGene/Q series just to provide one example. \nIn this context it is important that this paper argues \nthat ‘big data processing’ cannot be done only with the \n‘Map-Reduce method’, because very communication-\nintensive scientific applications \(a supporting underlying low-latency \nnetworks \(e.g. Infiniband b of scientifically-proven physical models \nand libraries created over the last decade established by npeer-review procedures by the HPC and scientific \ncommunities that cannot be easily transformed into MAP-\nREDUCE steps. To provide an example, G. Fox et al. \ndescribes in [13] why scientific applications solving npartial differential equations \(PDEs e.g. n-body simulations for \nthe ‘Iterative Map-Reduce’ method. We further expect \nmore and more data analysis libraries to be important for \n‘big data processing’ \(e.g. R MPI package [22 visualization of scientific data’ is a \nconventional data analysis method is established and \nintensively used since many decades. We refer here to the \nvery processing-intensive simulations in the context of \nHPC simulations where each step is computed according \nto physical laws and visualized on the fly. To provide an nexample to obtain insights from computational \nsimulations, so-called ‘streamlines’ and ‘integral curves nare one of the important techniques that use vector fields \nand represent the cornerstone of visualization and data \nanalysis across a variety of application domains as \ndescribed by D. Camp et al. in [23]. This also includes the \nvisualization techniques required for large ‘big data’ \ncurrently emerging on large-scale HPC resources in \nscalable computational simulations. This method often \nimplies an interactive channel from the simulation to the \nclient desktop in order to show step-wise progress on \ncomputational simulation runs on the fly. \nAdding another scientific data analysis method to the \n‘visualization method’ is called the computational \nsteering’ method, which refers to the change of HPC \nsimulations and their application parameters during the \nrun-time on large HPC resources. This data analysis tool \nhas the advantage to flexible steer the focus of a HPC \napplication run to regions of interests dynamically \nunderstood via the visualization’ method. Although the \n‘computational steering’ method could be applied \nstandalone \(e.g. air shaft open/close within a \ncomputational fluid dynamics simulation it applied in context of \nvisualizations. In the context of DCIs in general and the \n‘Distributed European Infrastructure for Supercomputing \nApplications \(DEISA  method in various scientific application \ndomains but especially with those having a step-wise \nfashion to perform simulations on large HPC resources. \nHence, the step-wise approach not only enables the \nvisualization progress as mentioned above, but also the \nstep-wise change of parameters \(aka steering behavior. This method thus often implies a bi-\ndirectional interactive channel to transport current nvisualization progress to the client desktop while on the \nother hand transporting steering parameters from the client \ndesktop back to the ‘steered scientific simulation’. \nTo provide an example for this method, we used an \nimplementation named as the ‘Collaborative Online \nVisualization and Steering \(COVS  n-body \nsimulations in astrophysics and plasma-physics while the \nlatter is illustrated in Figure 3 alongside some steering \nparameters and necessary connection options. As the \noptions reveal, the COVS tool is realized with the \nmiddleware UNICORE that is available on a wide variety \nof DCIs today. Given its low-intrusive design where the \n‘client act as a server’ [20], the COVS tool is able to \nanalyze scientific applications that make use of ‘big data’. \nThis paper thus argues alongside others from the \nvisualization domain \(e.g VisIt team [25 in the processing and analysis of \nscientific ‘big data’ \(e.g. in extreme scale simulations Scientific investigation using computational steering and \nvisualization techniques is a valid ‘big data analytics’ method [20].  \n148\nIV. RELATED WORK  \nThere is a wide variety of related work in the context \nof scientific data infrastructures and possible architectural \napproaches that partly also address processing methods. \nOne of the largest distributed data infrastructure was \nestablished by the High Energy Physics \(HEP community \ncreating the ‘World-wide Large Hadron Collider \nComputing Grid \(WLCG  napproach, the WLCG data infrastructure is not multi-\ndisciplinary and particularly focussed on HEP physics ndata sharing and analysis using specific algorithms,  \nmethods, and services  from the HEP community \(e.g 


nGAUDI [33  represents \nonly one user community, but EGI is rather HTC oriented \nthus limiting the methods to gain scientific insights that \ncan only be done with large-scale HPC resources. In \naddition, EGI is moving towards a dynamic cloud-based \nmodel while the approach of EUDAT and its methods \nrather focus on the traditional computing paradigms such \nas HTC and HPC. In addition, storage space is rather \nspecifically negotiated in EUDAT instead of freely usable \nby registered ‘virtual organizations \(VOs  PRACE [9], but in contrast to our \napproaches in EUDAT, PRACE is much more focussed \non peta-scale HPC simulations instead of ‘big data’ \nstorages and the provisioning of ‘high productivity \nprocessing methods’ as listed in Section III.  \nThere are also a wide variety of related existing data \ninfrastructures in the field that we can not list all due to \nthe page restriction of this paper. One example of these \ndata infrastructures is the ‘PaNdata infrastructure for \nneutron and proton sources’ [28] that create with an nincreased set of sensor technologies more and more ‘big \ndata sets’.  In comparison to our approach, we can state \nthat the approach is much more standards-based, but being \nfundamentally oriented towards one user community. \nAnother example of a community-specific data \ninfrastructure is the ‘European Clinical Research nInfrastructure Network  \(ECRIN  nEUDAT \(e.g. long-term preservation of \n\(often anonymized ICOS  well as ~10 oceanic sites. Hence, \nthis related data infrastructure raise the challenge for real-\ntime analytics of scientific measurement data that we did \nnot mention in our survey of methods in Section III due to \nour limit in experience with it. Nevertheless, the work \nwith this data in EUDAT is a reasonable future work idea \nin particular when processing real-time data that can be at \nleast partly realized with the aforementioned‘Map-\nReduce’ method’. Also the ‘computational steering’ \nmethod might be a reasonable future work  item in this \ncontext to explore ‘regions of interest’ within the real-time \ndata-streams in order to prevent the storage of potentially \nuninteresting measurement data originating from the \nmultiple sensors. \nIn terms of access and processing of large-scale data \ncollections \(e.g. repositories, gene ontologies proteomics \ndata, archives of protein sequences, etc Biological Information \n\(ELIXIR  Envisioned solutions for a \nfederated ‘Authentication and Authorization \nInfrastructure \(AAI those of EUDAT and \nshould be kept in-sync in order to enable data sharing and \nlarge-scale data processing on DCI resources using several \nof the methods described in Section III. In this context, \nalso the data infrastructure for chemical safety diXA is an \ninteresting related work since it offers a ‘data pipeline nsolution [32] that could be of interest to the available \nsolutions in the context of  our surveyed workflow’ \nmethods.  \nV. CONCLUSION \nAs mentioned in the beginning one of the often \nreferred defintions about ‘big data’ states that it cannot be \nprocessed using so-called ‘conventional methods’. We \nsurveyed several known conventional methods \(i.e. \niterative Map-Reduce, scientific workflows, databases nmassively-parallel processing algorithms, and \nvisualization and steering and our scientific application work experience in \nparticular. We conclude that these conventional methods nare able to process ‘scientific big data’ as many of the data \nchallenges in the past is the current work practice of today \n\(e.g. visualization and the growing amount of CPUs/cores \nwas a trend over decades thus further argue that the \ncommercial approach of Map-Reduce for ‘big data’ is \nequally interesting for the data analysis in science and \nengineering, but representing only on of several methods \nthat will play a role in the ‘high productivity processing’ \nof large-scale scientific ‘big data’ or ‘data-intensive \ncomputing nAnother conclusion we derive from working with \nscientific datasets \(e.g. big brain slices of 40 GB each nsummarizing to a whole brain with ~700 TB computation \nto the data’ instead of ‘bringing the data to computation’ \nis at least partly wrong in our scientific DCI ecosystems.  \nThis can be explained by the fact that the large community \nand data centers \(cf Figure 2 to have scalable solutions for growing \nand new data volumes \(e.g. portable IO formats, or \nscalable I/O libraries, etc nsaving bandwidth for a while, but the expertise at the \ndifferent centers is much more valuable that outperform \nthe safe of bandwidth in a few data analysis cases by an \norder of magnitude.  \nFinally, we conclude that the shift of view from a \ntraditional ‘computing oriented’ focus in DCIs towards a \nmore ‘data oriented’ focus provides a more complete \nview on necessary services and approaches in the DCI \ncommunity

Table III shows the conversion time and running\ntime of METIS. The conversion time of DBLP is about 7.5\nhours even though it has the smallest number of triples. It\ntook about 35 hours to convert the Freebase to a METIS\ninput ?le. We believe that this is because there are much more\nvertices which are connected to a huge number of vertices on\nFreebase and DBLP as shown in Fig. 4\(e existing\ngraph partitioning tools require similar input formats, this\nresult indicates that the graph partitioning-based distribution\ntechnique may be infeasible for some RDF datasets.\nTABLE III: Graph partitioning time \(sec 27218 130\nFreebase 91826 2610\nDBpedia 3055 504\nFig. 6 shows, for different building blocks, the ratio of the\ntotal number of triples of all generated partitions to that of\nthe original RDF data. A large ratio means that many triples\nare replicated across the cluster of machines through the data\npartitioning. Partitions using the 1-hop extended out-vertex or\nin-vertex blocks have 1 as the ratio because each triple is\nassigned to only one partition based on its subject or object\nrespectively. As we mentioned above, the results show that\nthe graph partitioning-based distribution technique can reduce\nthe number of replicated triples considerably, compared to the\nhashing-based technique. This is because the graph partitioner\ngenerates components in which close vertices, which have\nhigh probability to share some triples in their extended vertex\nblocks, are assigned to the same component. Especially, there\nare only a few replicated triples for the 2-hop extended out-\nvertex blocks. However, for the other extended vertex blocks,\nthe reduction is not so signi?cant if we consider the overhead\nof the graph partitioning-based distribution technique.\nD. Query Processing\nTo evaluate query processing performance on the generated\npartitions, we choose different queries from one benchmark\ndataset \(LUBM2000 DBpedia a set of benchmark queries,\nwe select three among them. Note that Q11 and Q13 are\nslightly changed because our focus is not RDF reasoning.\nWe create three queries for DBpedia because there is no\nrepresentative benchmark queries.\nFig. 7 shows the query processing time of the queries for\nTABLE IV: Queries\nLUBM Q11: SELECT ?x ?y WHERE { ?x <subOrganizationOf> ?y .\n?y <subOrganizationOf> <http://www.University0.edu>}\nLUBM Q13: SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x <rdf:type> <GraduateStudent> .\n?x <undergraduateDegreeFrom> <http://www.University0.edu> }\nLUBM Q14: SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x <rdf:type> <UndergraduateStudent>}\nDBpedia Q1: SELECT ?subject ?similar WHERE n<Barack Obama> <subject> ?subject. ?similar <subject> ?subject. }\nDBpedia Q2: SELECT ?person WHERE { ?person rdf:type> <Person>}\nDBpedia Q3: SELECT ?suc2 ?suc1 ?person WHERE {\n?suc2 <successor> ?suc1 . ?suc1 successor> ?person}\ndifferent building blocks and different distribution techniques.\nAll building blocks ensure intra-VM processing for LUBM\nQ14 and DBpedia Q2 because they are simple retrieval queries\nhaving only one triple pattern. For LUBM Q13, random, 1-in\nand 2-in needs inter-VM processing using Hadoop because\nQ13 is a star query and so all triples sharing the same\nsubject should be located in the same partition for intra-VM\nprocessing. On the other hand, for DBpedia Q1 which is a\nreverse star query where all triple patterns share the same\nobject, random, 1-out and 2-out needs inter-VM processing.\nFor LUBM Q11 and DBpedia Q3 where the object of one\ntriple pattern is linked to the subject of the other triple pattern,\ninter-VM processing is required for random, 1-out and 1-\nin. The results clearly show that using inter-VM processing\nis slower than using intra-VM processing because of the\ncommunication cost across the cluster of machines to join\nintermediate results generated from subqueries. Furthermore,\neach Hadoop job usually has about 10 seconds of initialization\noverhead regardless of its input data size. In terms of the intra-\nVM processing, the difference between the hashing-based\nand the graph partitioning-based distribution techniques is not\nsigni?cant for most cases even though they have different\nbalance and replication levels as shown in Table I and Fig. 6.\nWe think that this is because each partition is ef?ciently stored\nand indexed in the RDF-speci?c storage system, thus such\nlevel of difference on the balance and replication does not\nhave a great effect on query processing. The only notable\ndifference is when we use 2-out for partitioning because\nthe graph partitioning-based technique reduces the number of\nreplicated triples considerably. Especially, on DBpedia where\n2-out using the hashing-based distribution technique generates\nmany replicated triples, 2-out using the 


graph partitioning-\nbased distribution technique is three times faster than that\nusing the hashing-based technique for DBpedia Q3.\nIn summary, we conclude that the most important factor of\nRDF data partitioning is to ensure the intra-VM processing\n333\n01\n2\n3\n4\n1-out 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(a 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(b 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(c DBLP\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n1-out 1-in 1-bi 2-out 2-in\nR\nep\nlic\nat\nio\nn \nR\nat\nio\n Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(d Hashing-based\nGraph partitioning-based\n\(e Replication\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nQ13\n\(hashing graph hashing graph hashing graph y\n P\nro\nce\nss\nin\ng \nTi\nm\ne \nin\n S\nec\n  \nrandom 1-out\n1-in 1-bi\n2-out 2-in\n\(a LUBM2000\n1\n10\n100\n1000\nQ1\n\(hashing graph hashing graph hashing graph P\nro\nce\nss\nin\ng \nTi\nm\ne \nin\n S\nec\n  \nrandom 1-out\n1-in 1-bi\n2-out 2-in\n\(b Time \(sec or most slower than intra-\nVM processing.

However, for all the\nother cases, the hashing-based distribution technique is a better\ndistribution method if we consider the huge overhead of the\ngraph partitioning-based technique. Also it should be noted\nthat running existing graph partitioner can be infeasible for\nsome RDF datasets due to their complex structure.\nV. RELATED WORK\nGraph partitioning has been extensively studied in several\ncommunities for several decades [13], [15]. Recently a number\nof techniques have been proposed to process RDF queries on\na cluster of machines. Most of them utilize existing distributed\n?le systems such as HDFS to store and distribute RDF data.\nSHARD [19] directly stores RDF triples in HDFS as ?at text\n?les and runs one Hadoop job for each clause \(triple pattern  store\nRDF triples and, given a query, iteratively evaluates each triple\npattern of the query on the two tables to generate ?nal results.\nBecause they use general distributed ?le systems which are not\noptimized for RDF data, their query processing is much less\nef?cient than the state-of-the-art RDF storage and indexing\ntechnology [18]. [14] generates partitions using existing graph\npartitioning algorithms and stores them on RDF-3X. As we\nreported in Sec. IV, running an existing graph partitioner for\nlarge RDF data has a huge amount of overhead and is not\nfeasible for some real RDF datasets.\nIn addition, two recent papers [17], [16 have proposed\ntwo different approaches to general processing of big graph\ndata. [17] promotes to store a vertex and all its outgoing\nedges together and implemented a distributed system to show\nthe parallel processing opportunity of their approach. [16]\nproposes to store a vertex and all its incoming edges together\nand shows that this can speed up some graph processing on a\nsingle server, such as PageRank. In comparison, [17] presents\na system built using out-vertex block for both subject and\nobject vertices, whereas 16] presents a single server solution\nusing the in-vertex block for both subject and object vertices.\nBoth are special cases of our SPA partitioner. We argue that\nour SPA framework presents a systematic approach to graph\npartitioning and is more general and easily con?gurable with\ncustomizable performance guarantee.\nVI CONCLUSION\nWe have presented SPA, an ef?cient and customizable\nRDF data partitioning model for distributed processing of\nbig RDF graph data in the Cloud. The main contribution is\nto develop a selection of scalable techniques to distribute the\npartition blocks across a cluster of compute nodes in a manner\nthat minimizes inter-node communication cost by localizing\nmost of the queries on distributed partitions. We show that\nthe SPA approach is not only ef?cient for partitioning and\ndistributing big RDF datasets of diverse sizes and structures\nbut also effective for processing RDF queries of different\ntypes and complexity.\nAcknowledgment This work is partially sponsored by grants\nfrom NSF CISE NetSE program, SaTC program, and Intel\nISTC on Cloud Computing.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “About FacetedDBLP,” http://dblp.l3s.de/dblp++.php.\n[2] “BTC 2012 Dataset http://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/btc-2012/.\n[3] “DBpedia 3.8 Downloads http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads38.\n[4] “METIS,” http://www.cs.umn.edu/˜metis.\n[5] “Opening up Government http://data.gov.uk/sparql.\n[6] “Resource Description Framework \(RDF  Data-gov Wiki,” http://data-gov.tw.rpi.edu/wiki.\n[8] “UK Legislation http://www.legislation.gov.uk/developer/formats/rdf.\n[9] S.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
