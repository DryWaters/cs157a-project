Introduction \nThe current information systems have produced a \nlarge volume of data. The process of visual analysis of \nthis information has taken longer, has presented \ndifficulties to interact with the data and information is \nnot visible to the user depending on occlusion and \naggregation. The area of information visualization, and \nrelated areas, has sought over time to overcome these \ndifficulties, either by hardware evolution as increased \nvisual space and processing power, as developments in \nsoftware improvement techniques and algorithms, and \nsoftware evolution more hardware that ensures \nscalability of data growth. \n2. Information Visualization \(IV 12], the area of information \nvisualization aims to design compact graphical \nrepresentations and software interfaces that allow the \nuser to manipulate a large number of items of visual data, \npossibly extracted from large databases. \nA visualization tool created with these concepts \nallows the user to: Discoveries Decisions; Presentations \non: Standards \(trends, clusters, gaps, exceptions items. \nCard [3] states that allow the user computing support \nto view and interact with abstract data amplifies or \nenhances human cognition, enabling users to gain \nknowledge about the data and the relationship between \nthem. \nSecond Shneiderman [14] key features considered \nessential in an information visualization tool are: \nOverview, Zoom, Filters; Details on demand; History \nactions [4]; Ordination; Mapping visual attributes [11]. \n2.1. Process of Visualization \nNormally, the process of information visualization \nis part of a process of exploratory data analysis, \nknowledge discovery, or visual analysis. The quality of \nthese analyzes is dependent on the quality of the data that \nare available for interaction, and there must be a stage \nprior to elimination of data errors or noise. \nA visualization tool should be flexible enough to \nallow adapt to different user profiles: experienced, \nbeginners, with more or less skill in the problem domain, \nand they also feel comfortable to achieve their objects in \nrelation to the proposed display. \nFigure 01 Visualization pipeline [16] \nThe interaction with a visualization tool occurs at \nseveral levels and generates many intermediate products \n\(Figure 01 visualization are described below: \n• Data modeling: structure the data pattern to be set to \nenable the use of different sources with different layouts. \n• Data Selection: identifying a subset of data, which can nperformed manually by the user or an automated fashion. \n• Visual Mapping Data: the data are linked to abstract \nvisual characteristics, for example, can be mapped to \nfeature size, position, color, shape, etc n• Configuration parameters Cena \(Transformation \nVision n2013 17th International Conference on Information Visualisation\n1550-6037/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/IV.2013.18\n13847\nthe view that are relatively independent of the data, eg, \ncolor, sound, light, etc n• Rendering or generation of visualization: rendering \nvisualization is the representation of the image on the \noutput device. Moreover, most of the views include \nadditional information to facilitate interpretation of the \ndata, such as axes, annotations, images, etc. \n2.2. Related Work of IV \nIn this section are presented tools with similar \nfunctionality to the tool proposed in this work. We will \nbe presented three papers on information visualization. \nThe third work presented here was the starting point for \nthe development of environment-PRISMA MDE. \n2.2.1. Snap-Together Visualization: A User \nInterface for Coordinating Visualizations via \nRelational Schemata. \nSnap-Together is an information visualization tool \nthat allows users to rapidly and dynamically mix and \nmatch visualizations and coordinations to construct \ncustom exploration interfaces without programming. \nUsers can create different types of coordinations such \nas: brushing, drill down overview, details on demand, \nand synchronized scrolling. The assessment of snap-\ntogether reveals benefits cognitive issues, and usability \nconcerns [14].\n2.2.2. PRISMA - A Multidimensional Information \nVisualization Tool using Multiple Coordinated Views.  \nThe PRISMA tool is a desktop tool based on \nmultiple coordinated views, which has three main \ntechniques: scatter data, treemap and parallel \ncoordinates. PRISM supports the key features considered \nessential by the community visualization tool for \ninformation visualization, which 


were mentioned earlier. \nIn addition, the prism offers portability, extensibility and \nusability [6]. \nFigure 2. Image of PRISMA Tool. \n3. Multiple Display Environment \(MDE MDE Multi-\nDisplay Environments viewable \narea of the user, is usually employed when it is necessary \nto use many visuals simultaneously. In the area of \ninformation visualization this feature is often used to \novercome the problem of lack of space to the views of \nthe GUI [9], another problem that this type of \nenvironment helps minimize is the aforementioned nproblem of occlusion data. \nMonitors can be of different types, sizes and brand \n[5] and are connected to one or multiple machines [9]. In \nthe case of visualization tools for MDEs is recommended \nthat the tasks of rendering and processing techniques of \ndatabases are distributed among the machines. \nThere are different interaction techniques for multi-\nscreen environments, in order to exploit their specific \npossibilities. An important question is how the system \nhandles input devices and how the content is presented \nthrough the various screens. Several projects based on \nthis type of environment apply input redirection or \nforwarding content to interact with the devices. \nThere are two main approaches to enable this shift. \nExtended Desktop mode, the user moves the mouse \ncursor through the screen, as if interacting with a single \ndesktop. In the Multi-Monitor Mouse, the user moves the \ncursor from one screen to another by pressing a key on \nthe keyboard nContent Redirection enables content to be viewed \non a screen in another. That is, the user uses one screen nto interact with the contents of several others. Unlike the \nforwarding entry is not the cursor moves, but the content. \n3.1. Related Work of MDE \nWe used six work of MDE. The first work was used \nDesign Considerations for Collaborative Information \nWorkspaces in Multi-Display Environments and were \nemployed the design considerations for the viewer \napplication with multiple views proposed by Waldner, \n2009 [17]; as the focus of the work is not collaborative \nenvironments, then were not used design considerations \nfor collaborative environments for multiple screens. \nAnother work used was the Three Modes of Multi-\nSurface Interaction and Visualization of where we used \nthe taxonomy display styles in environments with \nmultiple views of multiple screens work proposed in \n[14]. \nBesides these works were used the concepts of \ninput redirection proposed work: "PointRight: \nExperience with Flexible Input Redirection in Interactive nWorkspaces" of [9]. We also used other work that \ndiscusses the adaptation of systems single screen and nmulti-screen environments entitled "Adapting to Single-\nUser, Single-Display Molecular Visualization nApplication for Use in Multi-User, Multi-Display \nEnvironment", proposed by [5]. \nWe also used a work that discusses design \nconsiderations and interaction environments for multiple \ndevices, titled: "Code Space Touch + Air Gesture \nHybrid iteractions is Suporting Developer Meetings" \nproposed by [2]. Finally, the framework will be \npresented libGlass which is an API for distributed \ncomputing, widely used in augmented reality and virtual \n[7], this framwork was used to make distributed \ncomputing for this work and it was made some \nimprovements in the input devices of the environment. \nThe related works used in this project are described \nbelow. \n13948\n3.1.2. LibGlass\nThe libGlass is a library for distributed computing \nand cloud computing, with a focus on high performance \napplications, low lag, particularly virtual and augmented nreality [7]. LibGlass The framework is a set of scalable \ncomponents that can be used by applications to achieve \ndistributed computing. This is an important feature, since \nmost of the available solutions for distributed computing \nrequire a substantial amount of rewriting legacy code, \nand some of them require a complete change of \napplication design [7]. The main objectives of the \nframework libGlass are cited below Transparency,\nExtensibility, Performance and Efficiency, Network \nprotocol independence, Scalability Reconfigurable \nnetwork architecture, Reliability and fault tolerance,\nThread support. \n4. PRISMA-MDE \nThe PRISMA - MDE is a distributed multi-screen \ncombined with a visualization tool of the PRISMA \ninformation that improves the problem of occlusion data \nand allows the user to interact with several instances of \nthe application in parallel. Each instance is run on a \nmachine itself, displaying the results of a different nvisualization technique. \nBy using complete machines not just plug in more \nmonitors system you can count on the resources of the \nmachine to load and manipulate databases growing \nwithout harming the user interaction The user can still \nadd more techniques for each instance, or more machines \nand more technical. \n4.1. Key Features \nThe main feature of this project is to give the \nimpression of an extended desktop user to continue in \norder to facilitate interaction between the different \nscreens mouse giving the impression of vision continues. \nThe organization monitors was tiled and the mode of \ninteraction was chosen input redirection Figure 03 mouse and keyboard disadvantage of this approach occurs in an \nenvironment with many screens, for example, if used ten \nmonitors and the user is accessing the last screen, and he \nis the first screen, move the mouse pointer will be time 


nconsuming because runs will be necessary to screen for \nscreen get to the last screen. \nTanenbaum defines a distributed system as a set of \nindependent computers that the user is viewing a single \nand consistent. [15 Then, another feature is a \ndistributed processing environment, where every \nmachine connected to the environment processes each \ninstance of the tool PRISMA-MDE, despite possessing \ncharacteristics of client-server architecture, where the \nserver concentrates the business logic for managing the \nenvironment and MDE clients distributed processing tool \nPRISMA-MDE, keeping the server as a history of \nactions, if any customer to be used offline. \n4.2. Architecture \nThe architecture of PRISMA-MDE was designed \nbased on the design pattern MVC \(model view control nwell-defined modules. The representation of the \narchitecture was divided into two parts: client and server nbut the latter can is present within a customer without \nloss of quality for the system. This work is called node" \nand any customer "master node" that the customer owns \nthe server. \nThe client architecture is composed of six main \nmodules: GlassClient, PRISMA and four control \nmodules \(Figure 04 user's actions \non the environment. The server has five main modules: \nGlassServer and four management modules Figure 04 type of action that \nthe modules exchange. \nFigure 04 shows a graphical representation of the \narchitecture for three nodes \(clients npresent in all submodules of the modules. This \nrepresentation of architecture lives up to the model \nadopted for the test environment to be presented in the \nresults section. \nFigure 04: PRISMA-MDE Architecture. \n4.2.1 PRISMA \nThe basis of this work is the development of \ninformation visualization tool PRISMA [6]. This tool nwas chosen because it is a desktop tool based on multiple \ncoordinated views, which has three main techniques: \nscattering data [14], parallel coordinates and Treemap, \nthe tool has been developed entirely in Java, giving full \nportability to systems running Java also has important \nfeatures for a good tool IV as overview, details on \ndemand, selection, dynamic filters, zoom, settings of \nattributes, statistical charts custom reports, access to \ndiverse data sources , relationships between data, and \n1409\nhistorical stock [4 Following are the three main \nmodules of the tool. \n4.2.2. VIS Module \nThe main feature of this module is to keep \nconfiguration information and generate visualizations \nbased on these settings. This module also makes nmanaging a data source \(XML, CSV or SQL Database of filters, colors, details on demand and \nmanagement of visualization techniques for generating \ngraphical views. This configuration information is also \nshared with the control module settings. \n4.2.3. Kernel \nThe core module is the main tool of the PRISMA-\nMDE, has a connection with the presentation module, a \ngenerator MóduloVis, and a MóduloVis. It is responsible \nfor various control activities, startup, shutdown the napplication, management ModuloVis, startup \npresentation module, executing actions from the user \ninterface and interweaving of the graphical components \nof the module presentation with models contained in \nModuloVis Another function is to exchange status \ninformation to the control module status. \n4.2.4. Apresentation \nThe presentation creates and manages the \ncomponents of the graphical user interface. These \ncomponents are created according to the user's needs, for \nexample, when the user adds a new source of data or for \ntechnical application; this requires the creation of new \nconfiguration panels for example. The Presentation \nmodule has a strong link with the Center, where the \npresentation creates a new view \(this is a configuration \npanel or a panel drawing module. \nThis approach was chosen for the development of \nthe tool PRISMA [6] and the authors intended future nwork with web interfaces, wherein the presentation \nmodule could become a WebService providing \ninformation and a communication path for any platform \ncompatible, in the home environment MDE, this \napproach may be used for future development of \ncollaborative environments. \n4.2.5. Control Settings \nThe module configuration control is responsible for \npacking and unpacking messages and converts into \nshares of configurations of techniques, such as setting the \ncolor, size and labels the items, setting the axes X and Y \ncoordinates of the techniques and parallel scattering data. \nAn example of using this module is when an X \nclient makes the colors change a set of attributes, this \nmodule identifies the action, interprets and transforms\ninto messages, which forwards it to other clients for \nserver communication modules, when the message \nanother customer arrives at this module, which is also \npresent in other customer gets the message and takes \naction to change the color, automatically running inside \nthe module PRISMA. \n4.2.6. Dataset Control \nThe control database has a primary function to keep \nthe database updated, this module communicates with \nthe database manager server to receive the initial load of \nthe base, and the base case has been changed to make the nupdates for example, whenever a user makes a filter, this \nmodule converts the action in a query string and sends it \nto the communication modules, and when this module \nreceives a query string it converts into a 


filter action. \n4.2.7. Event Control \nThis module is responsible for synchronizing the \ninput events between devices, this is responsible for \nreceiving input actions and apply server on your \nmachine. Only the server can have the mouse being \nredirected for every customer, however, as previously \nmentioned, the server can be hosted within a customer \nmaking this a master node. \nCurrently this module works only with input events \nof mouse and keyboard, but can easily be extended to \nother controls, such as interaction devices by voice ngestures, tablets and other input devices as \nunconventional controls and other videogames.  \n4.2.8. Alive Control \nThe control module status is responsible to inform \nthe server every time a client connects or disconnects, \nthe server also receives information from other \ncustomers and maintains a table named customer assets, \nto be used by the communication module for exchanging \ninformation. This also answers the messaging server \nstatus check; these messages serve to know if the server \nwent offline unexpectedly. \n4.2.9 GlassClient \nGlassClient a set of modules is responsible for \ncontrolling the client and to communicate with the \nserver. This set was developed from the framework \nlibGlass that an API \(Application Programming nInterface lag, \nand applications of virtual and augmented reality. \nThe Glass framework is a set of scalable \ncomponents that can be used by applications to achieve \ndistributed computing. Applications are built by reusing \nthe available components as needed. One of the main \nobjectives of Glass is a framework being easy to use, not nonly suitable for new applications, but also for the legacy \ncode. This is an important feature, since most of the \navailable solutions for distributed computing require a\nsubstantial amount of rewriting legacy code and some of \nthem require a complete change of application design. \nThe modules control multiple screens and control \ncommunications are part of this assembly. The following \nwill show the main features of each of these modules. \n4.2.10. Multi-Display Control \nThis module is responsible for consulting the \nrecords of all clients and the server know the position of \nthe screens, for example, we will use three machines, one \non the left one in right and one in the center, in this case \nthe machine control panel will also host the server. In nthis example, the control module operates multiple \nscreens organizing the screens, he notes that the position \n14150\nof the machine that is present and makes settings areal \nextent of work for clients. \nIn Figure 04, the central server present on the \nscreen has information that there are two more customers \nwith the right side and one on the left when the mouse is \nmoved to the right, the input actions must be sent to the \nmachine's right side. This is the function of this module; \nknow the position of neighboring machines and which \nmachine is intended that action.  \n4.2.11. Communication Control \nThe primary responsibility of this module is to \nestablish communication with the server and make the \nexchange of messages. For that uses a computer network \nwith the TCP / IP, where communication is established \nfrom the TCP protocol, this was chosen because it is a \nprotocol for reliable connections, which enables delivery \nwithout error flow bytes n4.2.12. GlassServer \nThis, like the GlassClient is also a set of modules \ndeveloped based framework libGlass The modules: \nmanager multiple screens and communication manager \ncomposes this set. Its main function is to send and \nreceive messages sent by customers and apply some \nrules specific to each server module if necessary. \n4.2.13. Multi-Display Manager \nThe manager receives multiple screens of \ninformation devices that are connected to the server and \nkeeps this information so that clients can update the \ncontrol module multiple screens to do so, this module \ncommunicates with manager status to know which \ncustomers are still active. Another important function of \nthis module is to provide the initial load of settings, for \nexample the user is interacting with only two screens, \nand already has held various settings such as color filters nand others, when you include this third machine starts \nnow to your settings. \n4.2.14. Communication Manager nThe management module communication and \ncommunication is the control function is to effect the \nexchange of messages between the server and clients via \nTCP. Another function is to forward some of the \nmanagement modules before forwarding the message to \nthe recipient, ie, when it receives a configuration \nmessage that is routed to the module configuration \nmanagement applying some rules if necessary and \nforwards back this, which in turn sends to clients. \n4.2.15. Configuration Manager \nThe management module keeps track of incoming nmessages and applies rules for synchronization between \nconfigurations. To reduce network traffic, filters are \ntreated as settings because the message does not include \nportions of the database, only the query that is generated \nreduction. \n4.2.16. Dataset Manager \nThis is responsible for giving the initial load from \nthe database and replicating to customers, updates being \nmade on the basis of customers that when the base nmodule changes. This only keeps the last message stored \ndue to be transferred as queries. \n4.2.17. Event Manager \nIn this layer, also is stored only the last message, \nbecause there is no need to undo the actions of entry. \nThis is responsible for controlling the input and output \nevents. Currently this module only interprets input \nactions and outputs of mouse and keyboard, but could \neasily be extended to other types of 


interactions. The \ncapture event is always done from the server or "master \nnode" and referred to the communication module that \nsends to the client destination. \n4.2.18. Alive Manager \nThe status manager is responsible for receiving and \nstoring messages module status control, which tells you \nwhen the client connects and disconnects, furthermore, \nthis communication module tests in a period of 60 \nseconds to check if the client machine is still available. \n4.3. Prototype and Features \nThe PRISMA-MDE has three main techniques of \ninformation visualization: Treemap, parallel coordinates \nand scatterplot, other techniques can be easily integrated \ninto the PRISMA programs from defined interfaces [6]. \nFigura 05. Selection and data coordination nThe environment has the selection and coordination \nof data between multiple screens as shown in Figure 05 nbelow, these functions facilitate cognition from the \nprominence of the same information on different screens nand visualization techniques.\nFigure 06.Two machines extended a view. \nFigure 07. Four machines extended a view. \n14251\nThe PRISMA-MDE environment also supports key \nfeatures considered essential for the community of nvisualization in information visualization tool, described \nin Section 2 of IV. \nAnother concept employed in the environment \nPRISMA-MDE is the concept of scalability. Bondi [1] \ndefines scalability as a desirable characteristic in any \nsystem that demonstrates the ability to manipulate an \nincreasing portion of the working evenly, ie, be prepared \nto grow. Thus, the environment PRISMA-MDE is \ndesigned to support the entry of more machines. Figure \n06 shows the environment PRISMA-MDE with only two \nmachine and two monitors, one technique for extending \nboth monitors, finally Figure 07 shows the PRISMA-\nMDE machines with four and four monitors, in all \nenvironments has only been used a mouse and a \nkeyboard connected to the master node. \n5 Evaluations \nUsability Test \nOne of the main goals of PRISMA-MDE \nenvironment is to improve the problem of occlusion data \nby using a distributed, scalable multiple screens, for this; \nit is believed that the environment can best results when \ncompared only with the tool PRISMA. The usability \nevaluation is used with a method to generate quantitative \ndata for analysis, in addition to evaluating other \ninformation, which will be demonstrated later on. \nThe user tests have to evaluate the usability through\nthe use experience of the users who use the system, \nanother goal is to see how easy the software has to be \nclearly understood. The methodology of this assessment \nis based on quantitative data collection, and also for \nobserving the behavior of users watching their reactions \nas the aspects of the system, especially difficulties and \nproblems that only occur in a real scenario. \nHypotheses \nThe importance of clearly defining the goals before \nthe test definition, since these must be performed in \norder to highlight the usability criteria to be measured, so nthat in this work we apply the methodology proposed by \n\(Goodall, 2009 hypotheses \nabout the accuracy \(accuracy, number of hits of the \nproposed tasks time gain in solutions of \ntasks, from reducing the physical effort, mental and \ncognitive better performance, measured as \nthe number of discovered insights classification of user satisfaction nAccuracy \nThe accuracy measures the accuracy of the solution \nproposed tasks for the user. This accuracy is measured \nfrom the amount of hits and misses that users have the \ntasks of usability testing. The advantage of measuring \naccuracy is that the tools that provide a greater number \nof hits have great chances of being easier to interact. \n• Hypotheses 1: The PRISMA-MDE environment \nresulted in fewer errors compared to the PRISMA tool. \n• Hypotheses 1a: The advantage of the environment \nfewer errors using PRISMA-MDE is more common in \ntasks comparing the techniques in relation to the \nPRISMA tool. \n• Hypotheses 1b: There will be a significant advantage \nof fewer errors using the PRISM environment in MDE-\nidentification tasks, as compared with PRISM tool. \nIt is expected that participants were more accurate \nand have fewer errors on all tasks using the PRISMA-\nMDE environment than the PRISMA tool. Hypothesis 1 \nevaluates the environment in general while the \nhypotheses 1a and 1b are evaluating the interaction tasks \nbetween the tool and the environment The accuracy \nshould be more pronounced for the tasks to compare due \nto the existence of a screen for each technique, \ncompetition for space will be smaller. \nEfficiency \nThe efficiency measures the gain of time in the \nresolutions of the tasks proposed to the participants of \nthe test. To gain that occurs while the tool has to be able \nto make a reduction of physical effort, mental and \ncognitive user. From this, the hypotheses were proposed \nas follows: \n• Hypothesis 2: The PRISMA-MDE environment the \nuser will spend less time to complete tasks, compared \nwith the PRISMA tool. \n• Hypothesis 2a: The advantage of spending less time in ncompleting tasks will be observing the environment \nPRISMA-MDE for the tasks of comparison regarding \nPRISMA tool. \n• Hypothesis 2b: There will be no significant advantage \nto spend less time environment using PRISMA-MDE in \nidentification tasks and conclusion regarding the \nPRISMA tool. \nIn general it is expected that participants spend less \ntime to solve all these tasks using the PRISMA-MDE \nenvironment than the PRISMA tool as described by \nhypothesis 2. Hypotheses 2a and 2b are evaluating the \ninteraction tasks between the tool and 


the environment. \nThe efficiency and accuracy had to be more pronounced \nfor the tasks to compare due to competition for smaller \nspace, ie has more space for the rendering of \nvisualization techniques. \nDatabase nOne difficult of this work was to find a dataset of \npublic domain with solid features and a big size. The ndatabase chosen was a multidimensional and real data \nare presented for all scholarships postgraduate in Brazil \nin the years 2008-2011. This base has extensive real data \nand consistent, and easy to understand for all users who \nwill run the tests and doesn’t require any additional \nknowledge to understand it. This database has 27552 \nrecords and 13 attributes qualitative and 5 quantitative. \nTasks \nThe tasks were grouped into three groups: low-\ncomplexity tasks \(requires a simple answer, a "yes" or \n"no complexity \(does not require \nthe analysis of various attributes, at most two requires a more elaborate and analysis \nof three or more attributes  nThe application of usability testing took place in an \nenvironment with three computers tower format, with neight gigabytes of RAM, Intel Core i7 and three 20-inch \nmonitors, each monitor connected to a tower. The napplication server has been placed in the customer \ncenter, thus, a "master node" and only used the mouse nand keyboard of the customer master. We chose a group \nof ten people with experience in computing and ninformation visualization. This group was divided \nrandomly into two groups of five. \nThe start of testing occurred with a brief \npresentation of the application for users with an average \nduration of five minutes after the initial presentation, the \nevaluators invited users to interact with the tool for \nanother five minutes, where they could ask questions and \ndo some tasks not compose the test, but allow for a \ngreater sense of environmental features. \nAfter the presentation of the general features of the \nenvironment PRISMA-MDE, users passed the first \nquestionnaire, which aimed to prove whether or not the \nhypotheses presented in section 5.1.1. This questionnaire \nhas the tasks listed in section 5.1.3 and is present in \nAnnex 01 with the maximum solution for five minutes \neach. After resolution of the tasks in the first \nquestionnaire was handed an additional form with 10 \nobjective questions to assess the degree of user \nsatisfaction when interacting with the tool. \nFinally, users were asked to respond to review \nNASA Task Load Index \(NASA TLX that is a \nmultidimensional scale designed to obtain estimates of \nworkload for usability testing of one or more operators \nwhile they are performing a task or immediately after \n[17]. \nWorkload is a term which represents the cost of \nperforming the job requirements for human operator. If \npeople could accomplish all that is expected of them with \nspeed, accuracy and reliability using the available \nresources, the concept would have little practical \nimportance \(Hart & Stavenland, 1988 nIt is noticed that the group decided that the tasks \nusing the PRISMA-environment MDE had a number of \nhits greater than the group that used the tool PRISM. \nOverall, there was a match of 18% more environment-\nPRISMA MDE, the hit was even more pronounced in \ncomparison tasks. This confirms the hypothesis 1, 1a and \n1b, which assume that the prism-DEM would provide \nfewer errors, especially in comparison tasks, which can \nbe seen in Figure 08 with the graph of mean hit by task. \nIn general users who used the environment \nPRISMA-MDE were 22 faster than users who used the \ntool PRISMA, thus proving hypotheses 2, 2a and 2b, \nwhich addresses the efficiency, ie, users would take less \ntime to resolution of tasks, especially tasks for \ncomparison. The tool PRISMA was more agile in an \nidentification task complexity easy to solve because the \ntask would not be necessary to use more than one \ntechnique and includes the analysis of a single attribute. \nFigure 09. Average time to resolution. \nOverall the workload for the PRISMA tool was \nhigher than the workload for the environment PRISMA-\nMDE. These values are calculated from a scale marked \nby the user immediately after the test run, the test \nproposed NASA TLX \(Hart & Stavenland, 1988 frustrated and \nhave had a mental and physical demand lower than users \nof PRISMA tool, as shown in Figure 10 Another \nimportant item that is worth mentioning are those users \nof the PRISMA found that its performance was superior \nto that actually obtained. This is due to the resolution of \nseveral tasks with some visualization techniques that \nprovide occlusion data, passing a wrong idea to the user \nas their performance, but this issue needs further study. \nFigure 10. Workload per area\nPerformance tests \nTypically performance appraisals do or seek to do a \nload test to find the limits of data processing software \ntested, and evaluated in specific scenarios and \nconfigurations. This work does not seek to find the limit \nof the processing tool or environment PRISMA \nPRISMA-MDE, but rather, making a comparison \nbetween the applications of information visualization. \nThe performance evaluation proposed in this paper \naims to measure the performance of the environment and \nthe MDE-PRISMA PRISMA tool through three variables \nprocessing time, memory consumption and processor \noccupancy. In this work, the processing time is \nconsidered from the moment that user finishes ordering \nthe action to the computer until the time when the \ncomputer displays the result of the action, for example, \n14453\nyou want to carry three techniques in information \nvisualization three monitors with different 


environment \nPRISMA-MDE. Time will start counting after the user \nhas selected the techniques and when he let go of the \nmouse button \(MouseAction Release rendering \ntechniques on all machines. \nHypotheses \nThroughout the planning and development of nenvironment-PRISMA MDE were created some \nexpectations that the environment could have superior \nprocessing characteristics already found in the PRISMA \ntool. All these possibilities were converted into three nhypotheses describing the environmental performance \nPRISMA-MDE. These are described below: \n• Hypothesis 1 Rendering time overview of the \nenvironment will be less PRISMA-MDE compared the \nPRISMA tool. \n• Hypothesis 2: The CPU consumption of the \napplication and render a filter query on the environment \nwill be less compared to MDE-PRISMA PRISMA tool. \n• Hypothesis 3: The difference of the memory \nconsumption of the initial load of the data will not have \nsignificant relevance between the environment and the \nMDE-PRISMA PRISMA tool nHypothesis 1 refers to the initial loading of data \nfrom the time that the user terminates the choice of nvisualization techniques so far that the machine finishes \nrender the images on the screen. \nHypothesis 2 refers to the application of query \nstring and rendering of a query filter, from the moment \nthe user finishes set the filter up to the moment when the \nmachine finishes rendering the new image on the screen. \nHypothesis 3 refers only to load initial data, namely \nfrom the time the user finishes connecting the database, \nor open the file until the moment that the system offers \nthe choice of views. \nResults \nFigure 11. Consumption of time in rendering \noverview by size of the database \nFigure 11 shows the time taken to render the \noverview bases to five thousand, ten thousand, twenty-\nseven thousand and fifty thousand records. In all the \nbases environment PRISMA-MDE was more agile, \nnoting that at the base of fifty thousand PRISMA tool \ntook more than 36/2 to render the overview of the three \nvisualization techniques used in the tests, thus \nconfirming the first part of Hypothesis 1. \nThe second part of one hypothesis refers to the \ncharging time of the database which is shown in Figure \n11, where the PRISMA-MDE also met the expectations \nbeing faster than the tool PRISMA. Generally the \nenvironment took 18% of time unless another tool. \nFigure 12. Time consumption in the process of \ninitial charge by size of data base data \nFigure 13. CPU consumption in the process of \nrendering overview by size of database \nAnother point was evaluated in the CPU rendering \noverview, in general, the environment PRISMA-MDE \nconsumed 33% less than the PRISMA tool, as shown in \nFigure 13. \nThe memory consumption of rendering the overview was \n9% lower for MDE environment, when compared to the \nPRISMA tool Reaching peaks of up to 40% less on the \nbasis of twenty-seven thousand records.  \nFigure 14. RAM consumption in the process of \ninitial loading of databases for data base size \nHypothesis 3 refers to the RAM consumption of the \ninitial load of the data. In some sizes database there is \nnot much difference in intake observed between the \nenvironment and the tool PRISMA-MDE PRISMA, this \nis, because the initial load of the database is replicated \nparas the various machines in the environment, thus the \nconsumption memorio to be near the memory nconsumption of the initial load from the database tool \nPRISMA nevertheless it is still possible to realize a ndifference of 3% less memory consumption prism-DEM, \nas shown in Figure 14. \nFigure 15 shows the RAM consumption in the \naction of filtering, where the environment MDE less \nmemory consumed mainly in larger bases. This \nconsumption was 52% lower than the PRISMA tool. \n14554\nFigure 15. RAM consumption in action filter \nConclusions  \nPresented by the context, this work proposes to \ndevelop visualization tool CMV information from a \nsingle screen to a distributed system of multiple screens \nand processors. The visualization tool was used PRISMA \ninformation. As communication support for distributed \nenvironment was used libGlass library, the core of \nPRISMA, which generates the visualizations was \nmaintained, try their communication interfaces rebuilt, \nand other embedded control modules. The coordination \nbetween views now features two levels, local \ncoordination between the visualization techniques on the \nsame node-processor, and global coordination, which is \nthe coordination between all the various visualization \ntechniques we-processors that allow for coordination \ncertain visual property, e.g., color, transparency, etc.. \nSome guidelines have been set for the evolution of \nPRISMA, PRISMA-MDE, while scalable and distributed \nenvironment of multiple coordinated views of data: \n• Interaction: the environment must have an interaction \neasy and usable, and should allow support for other \nunconventional forms of interaction \(kinect, wii remote Performance: PRISMA MDE should provide better \nperformance than the desktop PRISMA; \n• Perception of User user perception must be better in \nPRISMA PRISMA MDE compared to desktop; \n• Configuration / Reconfiguration the user must be \nable to configure or reconfigure the position, size, \nresolution and the device itself; \n Sync / Update: data needs to be synchronized across \nall devices and be kept updated throughout the execution nof the system; \n• Scalability: the environment must have the ability to \nincrease when it is necessary for the user, ie the user can \nadd more devices during the execution of the system; \n• Multiple visions coordinates: the environment must \nhave resources to coordinate data presented on MDE. \nIn order to evaluate 


the process, two tests have been \nproposed to measure one's performance and compare the \ngenerated software already existing and another test to \nevaluate the usability of the proposed environment. \nThe performance of the MDE environment was \nbetter than the PRISMA. In usability testing, PRISMA-\nMDE was also better than the PRISMA, even though the \ntest showed that the environment needs to be an \nimprovement in the user interface in order to seek a \nbetter interaction with the same. \nFuture Work \n• Extend the environment multiple screens for a multi-\nuser collaborative environment. \n• Making new usability studies in order to improve the \ninterface of the environment PRISMA-MDE. \n• Make further study on interaction devices for multi-\nscreen environments. \n Adapting the environment for the use of devices such \nas tablets, mobile phones and others. \n• Evaluate the behavior of the environment in a \ngeographically distributed network \(WAN which power scalability \nof the environment. \nReferences \n[1] Bondi, A. \(2000 and their \nimpact on performance.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
