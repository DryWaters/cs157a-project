The method proposed fuses several criteria using the Belief Theory for the road selection process Belief Theory allows one to reason with uncertainty and suggests a way for combining uncertain data This theory was introduced by Dempster 1968,1976 and mathematically formalized by Shafer in 1976 Shafer 1976 It is the generalization of Bayes Theory in the treatment of the notion of uncertainty It allows to take into account the uncertainty of partial knowledge Generally, this theory is used in a mnltisensor context to fuse heterogeneous information in order to obtain the best decision The basic entity is a set of all possible answers \(also called hypotheses to a specific question This set is called the frame of discernment and is denoted 8 All the hypotheses must be exclusive and exhaustive and each subset of the frame of discernment can be a possible answer to the question The degree of belief of each hypothesis is represented by a real number in O,l called a mass function m It satisfies the following rules m  0 zm\(A 4 Ace A mass function is defined for all the different evidences. Each evidence A for which m\(A  0 is called a focal element The mass notion is very near to the probabilistic mass notion, exception that it is not shared only on single hypotheses but it is possible to attribute a mass for an union of hypotheses this is the main difference with Bayesian theory As the application is related to road safety only geometrical criteria are used because they are not influenced by human errors This means for example, that a criterion such as the speed of the vehicle is in agreement with the speed limitation is not considered formulated as follows The two criteria chosen in this article can he 1  the vehicle location is close to a segment of the neighborhood 2 segments on which the vehicle can be located are those which have an angle close to the heading of the vehicle This criterion depends on the estimated 3 bound of the heading and the speed of the car The Belief Theory needs the affectation of elementary probabilistic masses delined on O,l The mass assignment is computed on the defmition referential 2 2e 0SI,,H2 _ H.,Hj vH2   H~uH,uHwfiu  H   This distribution is a function of the knowledge about the source. The whole mass obtained is called \223basic mass assignment\224 The sum of these masses is equal to 1 Each expert or each source of information defines a mass assignment according to its opinion about the situation The frame of discernment that we use is 0 Yes No Perhaps corresponding to the answer of the following question is this segment the good one To build functions of mass assignment corresponding to 0 we propose to consider the inaccuracy of the various information sources DGPS Odometer and digital map and physical observations for example a car with a 40ds speed cannot be orthogonal to tbe direction of the segment\With this approach information sources \(also called criteria are worked out from sensors The problem of mass assignment of each criterion can be tackled in a global or local way The global strategy consists to consider together all the segments selected around an estimated position when affecting the masses The local strategy separately treats each segment with respect to the criterion considered 3.1 Proximity criterion The proximity criterion is based primarily on the measurement of the Euclidean distance between the estimated position and each segment taken in the road data base The estimated error of the position is quantified by an ellipse of 99 equi-probability produced by the EKF drawn in dark gray in Fig 6 The estimated position E is at the center of the ellipse To allot a mass to a candidate segment VB we proceed in the following way Let us note d the distance between the segment and point E Fig 5 Case of a non credible segment Yes 4 dES\222  BP Fig 6 Mass assignment of the proximity criterion The point S\222 falls at the intersection between the segment E8 and the ellipse The distance dES\222depends on the angle p which forms the segment ES\222l in the ellipse codinates system. In the zone d  dES\222 with a fuzzy modeling obtained by a probability-possibility transformation pubois and F\222rade 1993 Lassere 1997 Zadeh 1978 1986 the degree of membership is quantified. The first curve presented in Fig 6 assigns a mass to the assumption Yes In complementing the mass of Yes the mass to the assumption Perhaps is allotted Then the mass of Perhaps remains constant equal one for dES\222 c d  dES\222+e in order to consider the pmjection error and the errors on the co-ordinates of the segments of the data base. Finally the mass of assumption No is a step function starting from the distanced  dES\222ie 186 


In conclusion, the mass assignment of the proximity criterion depends on two variables  the distance d between the center of the ellipse and the segment  the angle fi between the distance support and the major axis of the ellipse The problem becomes more complicated when considering the width of the road We propose to model the road by a box centered on the segment, the length of which is equal to the one of the segment The exact influence of the width of the road I is difficult to take into account in the computations of the criterion because I modifies the values of fi and d To simplify we have chosen the following strategy 1 If the orthogonal projection of E exists inside segment AB d  dortho-I Fig 7a 2 If the orthogonal projection of E does not exist inside segment AB d  min\(dI,d2,d3 Fig 7b Fig 7 Computation of the distance d with the road-box 3.2 Angular criterion In this section a mass assignmnt function is proposed to express the fact that the most credible segments are those which have an angle close to the heading of the vehicle Figure 8 presents the fuzzy modeling of the absolute value of the difference between the heading of the vehicle and the heading of the candidate segment In fact This curve is an adaptive one according to two parameters 1 the speed ofthe vehicle.

optimization for larger transaction sizes and in cases where there are large number of candidate k itemsets 6 Conclusions In this paper e presented a parallel implementation of the Apriori algorithm on the SGI Power Challenge shared memory multi-processor We also discussed a set of optimizations which include optimized join and pruning computation balancing for candidate generation hash tree balancing and short-circuited subset checking We then presented experimental results on each of these Improvements of more than 40 were obtained for the computation and hash tree balancing The short-circuiting optimization was found to be extremely effective for databases with large transaction sizes Finally we reported the parallel performance of the algorithm While we d good speed-up we observed a need for parallel I/O techniques for further performance gains References  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Database mining A performance perspecti v e  I n IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engg  pages 5\(6 1993  R Agra wal T  Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in lar ge databases In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1993  R Agra wal H Mannila R Srikant H T o i v onen and A I V erkamo F ast disco v ery of association rules In U F et al editor Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  MIT Press 1996  R Agra wal and J Shafer  P arallel mining of association rules design implementation and e xperience Technical Report RJ10004 IBM Almaden Research Center San Jose CA 95120 Jan 1996  R Agra wal and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In Proc 20th VLDB Conf  Sept 1994  M Cierniak W  Li and M J Zaki Loop scheduling for heterogeneity  I n 4th IEEE Intl Symposium on High-Performance Distributed Computing also as URCS-TR 540 CS Dept Univ f Rochester  Aug 1995  M Holsheimer  M  K ersten H Mannila and H T o i v onen A perspecti v e on databases and data mining In 1st Intl Conf Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  Aug 1995  M Houtsma and A Swami Set-oriented mining of association rules In RJ 9567  IBM Almaden Oct 1993  H Mannila H T o i v onen and I V erkamo Ef 336cient algorithms for disco v ering association rules In AAAI Wkshp Knowledge Discovery in Databases  July 1994  J S P ark M Chen and P  S Y u  A n e f fecti v e hash based algorithm for mining association rules In Proc M SIGMOD Intl Conf Management of Data  May 1995 17 Proceedings of the 1996 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing \(SC\22296 0-89791-854-1/96 $ 10.00 ACM
