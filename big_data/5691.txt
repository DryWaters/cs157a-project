Due to the low level of informational flood control, the previous artificial observation data have big errors and maintenance difficulties leading to great losses. Currently, China aims to carry out digital water conservancy and a comprehensive real-time monitoring system over large reservoirs by means of remote video. Thus, flood control gradually transfers from a passive one to an active one. To further enhance the effectiveness and reliability of flood control, remote video monitoring system of flood control is needed and it can do dynamic monitoring on the flood, danger and disaster timely, knowing the situation at any time, and thus taking appropriate preventive actions and remedies to ensure a safe operation of reservoirs.

As BF533 has many outside-setting interfaces, this essay chooses SDRAM to store data and DPRAM to store character superposed data DPRAM, the dual ports RAM, has two independent addresses -- data wire and read-write control line. Its control logic and accumulator have been integrated in an electric circuit which has been widely integrated. Realizing the true dual ports asynchronous operation enables itself to be linked with many kinds of CPU ports and also it simplifies the electric design, increases the integrated level, and quickens data exchanging. Thereby, it can be used to store character superposed data that will be offered to the succeeding electric circuits 3.3V\all capacity, and low cost 3 The results of systematic analysis 433 Output of constant amount of line picture element ADV7181[8  i s an  inte grat ed v ide o  dec o di ng Ch ip produced by ADI company.

It mainly adopts BF533\222s UART\222s port[14 1 5 Because design of code needs a great amount of debugging work, deriving digital information from BF533\222s memory space through JTAG port often takes much time, for example 25 frames\222 pictures need half of an hour. Taking advantage of UART port can greatly shorten the time and in the succeeding design it can also make use of URAT port to link the system and the local monitor in order to succeed local digital communication, including RS232 and RS485.

QuakeSim portal tools were used to generate initial and subsequent meshes for input into GeoFEST viscoelastic simulation software   Figure 3 Fault parallel displacement for a: left panel: uniform slip model, middle panel: variable slip on the fault, and right panel: multiple segment San Andreas fault with plate boundary conditions. Residual velocities become smaller as the model becomes more complex forecast or the state of Califor nia. Approximately half the total boxes have at least 1 M>3 earthquake in them Therefore for the to tal active area, it would be forecast area of 2.4%. The approach is to minimize the forecast area which is essentially the false alarm rate, while still detecting all the large earthquakes \(maximizing the hit rate\The mean forecast error is the average distance that a M>5 earthquake occurs from a 11 km pixel box boundary. Most of this error is due to offshore earthquake # 6, which is about 50 km off the nearest red pixel. Without that earthquake, the error would be less than 5.5 km, half of one pixel box size. Additional earthquakes will allow us to optimize the forecast area Earthquake forecasts and models with time frames of years rather than decades and much smaller spatial scales on the order of 10 km rather than 100 km scales are now possible The models are based on patterns of seismicity at present Similar pattern recognition techniques will be used on the radar interferograms from DESDynI when they become available.  The methodology requires systematic data, which DESDynI will produce. Current InSAR missions do not produce systematic crustal deformation measurements   


  6  Figure 4 Recent successful forecast of the M 5.4 Chino Hills earthquake of July 29, 2008  5  C ONCLUSIONS  QuakeSim model applications are showing the importance of modeling the complexity and detail of fault systems Faults interact with each ot her, and the order in which earthquakes occur impacts the order of subsequent earthquakes.  Developing models to match observed data requires realistic models.  Efficiency is gained by the access of the data by models such as of QuakeTables through QuakeSim. Results from the Pattern Informatics method and Virtual California indicate that seismicity and crustal deformation produce detectable patterns that can be used to infer earthquake hazard. Con tinued modeling will indicate patterns of crustal deformation that may be key to improved earthquake forecasting.  Devel oping these prototypes now is important for being prepared to maximize the use of InSAR crustal deformation data from DESDynI and to develop a routine operational data analysis system.  UAVSAR will be a valuable testbed for developing a prototype system for DESDynI, but will also be important for filling in data gaps in response to earthquakes or other events 6  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  We\222d like to thank the many other QuakeSim contributors These include JPL staff members Charles Norton for the adaptive mesh refinement and porting and optimization of software to the Columbia and Cosmos systems, and Margaret Glasscoe for testing the portal using science applications and developing the web pages, and Harout Nazerian for developing the web pages and testing the portal.

managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
