high reliability. In large-scale identification system s, not only the volume of computing is extremely high but also the I/O volume per CPU second is extremely large. Therefore, how one places the data replicas in the computing nodes can have a significant impact on the pe rformance of id entification and on the availability of the bi ometric data sets. However, the traditional replica placement method used in the distributed processing frameworks and distributed storage technologies are unable to rebalan ce loads among nodes when the specific nodes are down and the throughput of identification slows. To 
address this problem, we propose a replica placement strategy called SPOAN, that enables us to rebalance the loads among computing nodes and maintain data more reliably. We also developed the architecture of the large scale identification systems using SPOAN. As the result of evaluations involving emulation of biometric database containing about 1.2 billion individuals, we found that we could rebalance the loads even when specific computing node s were slowed down unlike traditional placing systems of replicas and improve throughput

I I NTRODUCTION The process of confirming or iden tifying individuals is an essential component of many social scenarios. In particular, the series of terrorist attacks in the USA on September 11, 2001 significantly changed the level of importance of identifying individuals. However, personal identification based on possession of ID cards, numbers, or passwords is essentially incapable of preventing leaks, cou

nterfeiting or impersonation As a result, interest in biometric identification technology has grown, and its use in passports and immigration control is being adopted at an accelerating pace Citizen ID is one of the fields in which the application of biometrics is spreading rapidl y. At NEC, we have already achieved certain results in this field To use IDs in various authentication operations, a unique ID must be allocated to each citizen without duplication. This is guaranteed by collecting biometric information including facial images, images of irises of both eyes and fingerprints of ten fingers, checking if they are duplicated in previously 
recorded data Usually, in the field of in formation processi ng, the search index is developed in advance of registering the population in order to increase the speed of searching for the targeted individuals.  In biometrics, data from th e same individuals taken at different times may not match each other because the individual might have aged or because conditions prevailing at the time of collection were di fferent. As a result, it is generally difficult to develop an effective index. For example, in order to confirm that a person requesting regi stration is not duplicated all that can be done is to match the data with all of the 
registered data. In some identification systems that executes strict duplication checks, it is for bidden to narrow down the check targets by using personal demographic information such as gender, name and age, which means that the amount of required computation is enormous For example, to check for duplication among all of 1.2 billion people, about 7.2 × 10 17 matching operations are required. This workload requires some millions of CPU days so it must be parallelized across some hundreds of CPUs in order to complete it within a reasonable time. For example, to 
enable duplication checks on 60 0 million people in three years we have to implement a system capable of more than 1.9 billion matches per second without interruption In general, the fault occurrence rate of such a system will be high because the system is composed of an extremely large number of servers and the servers in charge of matching tend to be overused with CPU utilization rates of nearly 100 However, as this system is used as a government authentication platform, all operations should be able to continue, if the fault is in only a single component only

This means we can only handle the high volume of biometric data by making the thro ughput and availability of identification higher. Finding a way to do this is the motivation for our study  ework th at enables many serve rs to perform distributed process on large volume data sets while maintaining the redundancy of the data. In addition, research into the distributed storage ha ve the goal of balancing loads and maintaining availab ility. However, workload easily becomes unbalanced when some compute nodes are down or slow down Therefore, we developed SPOAN, a replica placement method that enables us to bala nce loads in order to support large-scale biometric identification systems. The results of a test show that improving the balance increases job throughput by 46% compared with the traditional replica placing methods In addition, we verified that 50 0,000 identifications per day in a biometrics database on 1.2 billion people is achievable The main contributions of this paper are as follows We developed SPOAN, metho ds of placing data replicas that enables us to balance th e loads to guarantee both high throughput and high reliabili ty. It is applicable to computation and data intensive workloads in a large-scale biometric identification system We developed a large-scale biometric identification architecture embodying the replica placement methods of SPOAN, and evaluated the job throughput. We verified that the target of 500,000 identifications per day in a biometric database on 1.2 billion people is achievable The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II gives an overview of biometric identification and a brief introduction to the MapReduce programming model. Section III presents the proposed SPOAN replica placement method Section IV shows the architecture of the large-scale identification systems using SPOAN. The evaluation and its results are described in Section V. Related work is discussed in Section VI. Section VII and Section VIII concludes the paper and outline future work II B ACKGROUND A ND M OTIVATION In the large-scale identification system, a scalability issue arises if the system is incapable of an efficient response to matching requests from the extremely-large-scale biometric database Even slightest delays in the overhead, idling of matching servers will occur, which results in reduced matching efficiency or attainment of the scalability limit at which the i throughput cannot be increased even when matching servers are added To achieve high enough thro ughput, one has to distribute large volume biometrics temp lates and use man y identification servers on parallel. A distributed parallel identification that can accommodate such a large scale data set is MapReduce of Google In the following subsection s, we will summarize the identification process and MapR educe. Then, we will discuss how to map the identification systems when MapReduce’s architecture is applied to large-scale identification systems Finally, we will explain the issues of large scale identification systems as they relate to MapR educe and the motivation for this study Fig 1 shows the biometric id entification process. The system captures the items such as finger prints, and iris and face images. After that, it extracts features from the captured raw images and creates a biometric template from them. Finally the created biometric template is matched against the biometric templates stored in the biometric databases to check if there are any duplications \(1:N search Usually, in the field of in formation processi ng, the search index is developed before the po pulation is registered in order to increase the speed of searching targeted individuals In biometrics, information gath ered at different times may not strictly match each other because of aging and the various conditions prevailing at the time of collection. As a result, it is generally difficult to develop and utilize an index effectively Consequently, all of registered biom etrics templates have to be used in order to ensure th ere are no duplications of a new registrant. That means the more registrants there are, the higher matching throughput must be. Therefore, the large-scale system requires extremely high throughput MapReduce is a software framework for writing applications which pr ocess large-scale data sets on large clusters in a reliable manner. MapReduce processes large volume data with multiple compute nodes by dividing a job into parallel tasks shows the architecture of MapReduce. MapReduce divides the dataset into multip le fragments \(chunks\of a certain size and distributes these chunks among the local storage disks of the individu al compute nodes. A map task will be assigned to each chunk. The map task is executed on multiple compute nodes in parallel The data processed in the map task is then cons olidated in a reduce task and the result is returned to the client Hadoop [2 is an ope nso urce implementation of the MapReduce framework

Fig 2. MapReduce overview Fig 3. Mapping of MapReduce and Identification System 
C Mapping of identification systems to MapReduce D Motivation 
The architecture of MapReduce is a g ood fit for our purpose because large-scale identification systems distribute their data to multiple nodes. In case of mapping identification architecture to the framework of MapReduce, one divides the biometric database into chunks and reads the chunks identifies them and returns the candidates. The matched candidates are then sorted by their scores in the reduce task Regarding large-scale identification systems using Hadoop Kohlwey et al  pr opos e d the Cloud Query Execution Framework In order to use MapReduce in the identification systems, we need to take care about the following tendency concerning the load on the CPU and the volume of data The map task will cause an extremely high CPU load on the compute nodes executing it because of the large volume data On the other hand, the CPU load in the reduce task will be extremely low because it only sorts the matching scores.  In addition, the map tasks have to read a large volume of data because they have to match all biometric templates in the database To check for duplication among all of the 1.2 billion people about 7.2 × 10 17 matching operations are required. To enable duplication checks on even 600 million people in three years we have to implement a system capable of more than 1.9 billion matches per second with out interruption In addition the biometric data has to be read in at approximately 17 TB/sec at the time of identification Large-scale identification systems not only have do many identifications but also have to read in large volume of data this makes them data intensive many-task computing  For these reasons, it is necessary to distribute the identifications to numerous identification servers. Furthermore the matching speed of th e multi-modal identification systems dealing with, for example fingerprint and iris image data varies depending on the quality of biometrics templates and the ratio of missing modalities. It means that the specific compute node could slow down depending on the bias of variation In addition, the failure rate of identification servers will be high because of the high CPU loads in identification Therefore, it is important for mu ltiple servers to be able to balance loads in order to balance the workloads of compute nodes while maintaining data redundancy Besides having high computing loads, large-scale identification systems have a high I/O volume per CPU second Data transfers have to be minimized while executing tasks in order to achieve high throu ghput because CPU utilization of the compute nodes will decrease when there is high volume of pending data transfers and reductio n in network bandwidth. To avoid large data transfers, one must assign the tasks to places where replicas exist in order to achieve the high throughput This means how one places the replicas in relation to the compute nodes determines the bi as of the load. In another words, data replica placement is key to balancing loads in large-scale identification systems However, Hadoop randomly places the replicas on the compute node g 4 a m p le of Hadoop’s replica placement. In some cases, replicas are biased to specific nodes, meaning that tasks are biased to specific nodes In addition, nodes holding a lot of replicas raise the rate of data loss Distributed RAID is the distribu ted storage technology that maintains the data redundancy and balan ces the data access  h is is t h e technology uses the storage nodes instead of disk drives as a minimum configuration unit. In particular, the mirror and striping placement method \(RAID 1+0\way to maintains chunks of replicas. Fig 4 \(b\hows an example of replica placement in the mirror and striping placement method The amount of data processed by each compute node equals the level of data redundan cy. However, the workload distributions would become unbal anced if the task execution slows down at one of the compute nodes because only one side of mirrored compute nodes can execute tasks That means although the distributed processing of the MapReduce architecture would be a good for our purpose conventional replica placement methods can’t balance workloads among compute nodes in large-scale identification systems The main motivation for our stud y is to improve the load balance among computing nodes while maintaining availability in the large-scale identification systems with high CPU and I/O demand

III SPOAN O UR R EPLICA P LACEMENT S TRATEGY In order to resolve above issues, we propose a replica placement strategy that balances the workloads of compute nodes while maintaining data re dundancy. We term our replica placement strategy SPOAN In this section, we describe SPOAN’s design goals and its load balancing and data redundancy effects The following two goals must be met by the replica placement method to achieve both the high identification throughput and reliability To achieve high job throughput, it is necessary to maintain a high usage rate of CPUs in compute node cluster. Therefore, our goal here is to balance the loads of compute nodes even if there are load biases due to the performance variation amo ng tasks or slow nodes To achieve high reliability, we should not allow the distributions of rep licas to stop identifications Therefore, our goal here is to prevent data loss if a compute node is down We should select a placement rule that balances loads in a way that also ensures the availability of data. It is simple to place replicas in multiple and different matcher nodes in order to ensure the certain level of data redundancy The main points of the replica placement policy to balance the loads are as follows A To equalize the number of tasks assignable to each matcher the data replicas should be divided up as evenly as possible among the matchers B Place the replicas on matchers to minimize the standard variation in the number of replicas to be shared among the matchers. The number of replicas to be shared among the matchers is hereinafter referred to as the mirror table value. In that way if one node is delayed another can carry out its tasks We can minimize the maximum lo ad by following load balancing rule A and rebalance the load by following load rebalancing rule B shows the replica placement when the number of matchers, chunks and th e level of data redundancy are 4, 6 and 2 respectively shows the mirror table value of SPOAN Because multiple matchers possess replicas of chunks, it is possible to distribute loads among the multiple matchers. In addition, it is possible to rebalance loads among the matchers if one or matchers slow down because the mirror table value is equalized among matchers. The mirror table value is equalized among matchers, meaning that the number of different replicas shared among matchers is high and the loads of delayed matchers can be propagated to different matchers. Therefore SPOAN can rebalance the workl oads of nodes quickly To better understand SPOAN replica placement, we will show some examples to illustrate the effect of load balancing with SPOAN and data red undancy using the examples Fig 7 shows the samples of mirror and striping replica placement \(MDP\SPOAN replica placement, when the number of matchers, chunks and the level of chunk redundancy \(No. of replicas\ and 2 respectively Fig 8 shows the mirror table values among matchers in the replica placements of MDP and SPOAN in Fig 7  Let us assume that the number of jobs is 4, tasks can process each chunk in 1 sec, and tasks are acquired in the order of Matcher 1, 2, 3 and 4 Fig 9 plots the job completion times of MDP and SPOAN in this case.

SPOAN and MDP placed two replicas at different matchers meaning so that both methods have high data redundancy when one matcher is down On the other hand, the availability of data in MDP is higher than that of SPOAN when two matchers are down. The reasons are, in reference to the mirror table value in Fig 8 there are many combinations of Matcher in SPAOAN where the mirror table’s values are more than 1, and it is possible that a matcher with multiple replicas could go down The reasons are, in reference to the mirror table value in Fig 8 there are many combinations of Matcher in SPAOAN where the mirror table’s values are more than 1, and it is possible that a matcher with multiple replicas could go down However, there are hundreds of matchers in the large scale identification systems and the quantity of replicas is in the thousands because of the high volume data. Th erefore, it is not as likely that matchers possessing the same replicas could go down at the same time IV A RCHITECTURE OF LARGE SCALE BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM Here, we explain the whole architecture of the large identification system and discu ss its design considerations for high performance and scalability The architecture of large scale identification basically inherits the spirits of MapReduce. However, we developed a unique implementation because MapReduce has several limitations. We will describe our reasons for doing so in the next section The large-scale biometric identification system has the following components The Planner computes the replica placement plan using SPOAN replica placement strategy, after dividing up the biometric database, it deploys chunks to the matcher nodes. These chunks will be placed in the nodes’ memories

Fig 7. Samples of the Mirrored Placement and SPOAN’s Placement Fig 8. Mirror Table Values of MDP and SPOAN As shown in Fig 9, the completion times of MDP and SPOAN are respectively 9 sec and 7 sec for job 4. That means the throughput of SPOAN is appr oximately 28% higher than that of MDP We can explain why this jobs throughput is higher by referring the mirror table values among matchers Fig 8 b shows that the mirror table values of the matchers are equal in SPOAN. The mirror table values between Matcher 3 and Matcher 1, between Matcher 3 and Matcher 2, and between Matcher 3 and Matcher 4 are each. That means, Matcher 3 has replicas shared by Matcher 1, 2 an d 4 so that the tasks using the data possessed by Matcher 3 can be executed by the other matchers in a distributed manner, and the loads can be balanced Fig 8 a\hows that the mirror table values between Matcher 1 and Matcher 2 and between Matcher 3 and Matcher 4 are only high in MDP. That m eans, Matcher 4 can only execute the tasks with chunks of C2, C4 and C6 possessed by Matcher 3 if Matcher 3 is down \(see Fig 7 a\he loads of Matcher 4 are only propagated to the Matcher 3. Therefore, the throughput of MDP will decrease if Matchers 3 is down The above example shows that SPOAN can rebalance the loads with multiple matchers even if matcher slows down. It means SPOAN can complete the whole jobs faster than MDP Jobs throughputs are high thanks to SPOAN’s placement Fi g 9:  Job Execution Time Com p arison of MDP and SPOAN

A Architecture Overview

The Matcher node requests tasks corresponding to the chunks it is assigned and performs matching on the chun ks placed in it. This is equivalent to the map task in MapReduce The Tracker divided jobs into multiple tasks corresponding to the number of chunks in the whole systems and hands over the tasks to the Task Scheduler when requested by the Task Scheduler Data-locality aware Task Scheduler assigns the unassigned tasks to matcher nodes. The tasks correspond to the chunks requested by matcher node The Aggregator sorts the scores of the matching results and computes the final candidates. This is equivalent to the reduce task process in MapReduce SPOAN’s replica placement and data-locality aware Task Scheduler balance the load among the matcher nodes. The Data Placement Planner places the replicas in the matcher nodes using SPOAN to balance loads among the matcher nodes, and Scheduler assigns the tasks to the matcher nodes which request tasks so that the matching can be done quickly in parallel The large-scale identificat ion system basically inherits MapReduces’s architecture. However, we developed the system without Hadoop because Hadoop has issues such as poor CPU utilization of the compute nodes and poor task scheduler’s scalability The first issue is that CPU utilization of the matcher decreases if Hadoop reads chunks from disks because the matcher needs to compute large volumes of data quickly. The second issue is that the performance of the task assignment worsens as the number of matcher nodes increases because the task scheduler has to assign a lot of tasks to compute nodes Below, we discuss the key design points for resolving these issues The volume of biometrics templates that one compute node reads in a seconds is very large \(tens of GB/s CPU usage rate decreases when chunks are placed on matcher nodes in the manner of Hadoop because it requires transfers from disk and networks. Because of this, we place the replicas on the Matcher nodes in adva nce of matching. In addition, we place them in the memory of the Matcher node because the replicas are read very often Because the speed of the matcher node’s identification is extremely high the task management cost of the Task Scheduler would be very high if the task execution plans, placement plans and delivery/execution results were aggregated individually. To avoid this, we decided to manage jobs in a certain period with a single execution plan. We succeeded in reducing the number of inter-server communications and the CPU power used in distributed management computations to several hundredths of their original values V E VALUATION We conducted the experiments to see how well SPOAN’s replica placement method balanced workloads in comparison with the existing replica placement method, and to determine whether the large-scale identification architecture has scalability In order to evaluate the workload balance of each replica placement method, we measured the job throughput of Hadoop’s random replica placement \(RDP\ with equal data redundancy, mirroring and striping placement \(MDP\, and SPOAN on a biometric database containing the data on 600 million   people To measure the throughput, we first measured the number of CPU cores needed by SPOAN to process 500,000 searches/day in a biometric database with the data on 600 million people. After that, we measured the job throughput of the other replica placement methods with the aforementioned number of CPU cores as the standard.  By creating a condition wherein a node’s process is delayed 100% when one matcher node stops, we made situation in which nodes slowed down and then evaluated the job throughput with each of the methods. We measured the number of CPU cores needed for SPOAN to have a job throughput of 500,000 searches/day, and then measured the job through put of RDP and MDP with the same number of CPU cores. We repeated the evaluation five times

In order to evaluate the scalability of architecture of the large scale identification systems using SPOAN, we increased the volume of registrants in the biometric database in steps of 200 million people up to 1.2 billion people, and evaluated the job throughput We tried to see if we can could achieve the Large-scale’s requirement of 500,0 00searches/day per scale of biometric database and determine how many CPU cores were needed Because of the high CPU loads in identification, we needed the hundreds of matcher nodes. We developed matcher emulator which emulated the real matcher performance Regarding the matcher emulator, we emulated 1,000 million matches/sec by assuming that each matcher server had 12 cores.  The Task Scheduler works on a real server equipped with Intel Xeon X5550 processor at 2.67 GHz with 32Gbyte memory shows the results of job throughput measurements for random replica placement \(RDP\irror replica placement MDP\nd SPOAN We found that SPOAN needed 3,600 cores in order to process 500,000 searches/day in the biometric database containing information on 600 million people. The maximum mirror table value of each replica placement method in RDP MDP and SPOAN were 1, 14, and 6 respectively The job throughput of SPOAN was 12% higher than RDP and 46% higher than MDP. It was also higher than RDP in worst, best and average cases shows the records of the actual measurement of the number of CPU cores needed to achieve 500,000 searches/day when we increased the volume of registrants in the database from 200 million people to 1.2 billion people. A throughput of 500,000 searches/day could be achieved with an additional 1,200 cores for every 200 million people added to biometric database. In addition, the CPU usage rate with Task Scheduler was only about 6% on average, ev en with 1.2 billion people The job throughput in SPOAN was up to 46% higher in comparison with random placement or mirror placement This is because the mirror table value of SPOAN is more uniform than RDP or MDP. Therefore, even if some nodes slowed down in SPOAN, other matcher nodes sharing the replicas can process the tasks and maintain th e load balance We expanded biometrics database to the level of 1.2 billion people, we achieved 500,000 searches/day with the additional 1,200 CPU cores per 200 million added to the database and the architecture scaled in a straight lin e. In addition, at 1.2 billion people, the CPU usage rate of the serv ers running the task schedulers is only 6% on average. As the targeted throughput was reached, we can conclud e that large scale biometrics architecture has extremely high scalability VI R ELATED W ORK In this paper, we proposed a replica placement method to balance the loads of compute nodes. Here, we discuss the related studies on load bala ncing among compute nodes in relation to the replica placement method and scheduling method Studies concerning how to place replica in a way that balances the loads are on going. Palanisamy presented the replica placement method that avoids placing high-load data set to certain compute nodes because the load per dataset is predictable. However, with the multi-modal identification systems, we cannot determine the loads of individual nodes in advance because the matching speed changes on the basis of the jo b and in accordance with the quality of biometric templates There are a number of dynamic replica placement techniques which balances worklo ads by dynamically placing replicas based on loads of the compute nodes  T h ese  techniques can minimize the required storage capacity because replicas are created and moved only when necessary. However

in large scale identification system s, the volume of replica is larger and the cost of data transfers becomes higher so that there is an issue of lower job throughput Chervenak sed to replicate data across sites on demand. In this research, the workload scheduler manages the distribution of data across a wi de-area network to dedicated storage servers in each cluster. Our work focuses on replica placement in a local-area cluster and minimizing data transfer Distributed database sy stems like TeraData use centralized external storage arrays and proprietary high-speed interconnects with high bisection bandwidth. However, the network bandwidth is low for large-scale biometric identification because it requires more than 10 terabytes worth of I/Os per sec to compute. All biometric templates must near the compute nodes’ memories  scheduling policies for task assignment to hosts in distribu ted systems. However, they dealt with scheduling independent tasks among a set of servers Our work deals with improving the throughput of jobs containing multiple tasks Zaharia proposed Delay Scheduling, which delays the assignment of tasks in case there is no data locally in a compute node, in order to place replicas in compute nodes locally. However, although it does reduce the data transfer rate it cannot completely elimina te data transfers. Moreover, it doesn’t solve the load bias issue mentioned in the preceding sections A load balancing met hod has been proposed that dynamically changes the number of slots for empty tasks based on the usage rate of computing res  However, the CPU usage rate of compute nodes is close to 100% in the large-scale biometrics system, so that it is difficult to measure the usage rate of computing resources of each node frequently. Therefore, an issue arises in how to assign the tasks optimally when the measur ement frequency of resource usage is necessarily low VII C ONCLUSION We proposed a replica pl acement method called SPOAN that balances loads among nodes in order to avoid the load balancing issues of the MapReduce framework and conventional distributed storage technology when they are applied to large-scale identificati on systems. SPOAN works by deploying replicas equally among the nodes and sharing the same replicas among the compute nodes SPOAN balances the workloads of matcher nodes and we showed that it enhances the throughput of identification jobs by up to 46% in comparison with the random replica placement and mirror replica placement, even when certain compute nodes slowed down. In add ition, even when compute nodes slow down, jobs can be performed without data transfers among compute nodes so that job throughput is high Furthermore, SPOAN has same av ailability in comparison with random placement and mirror placement when one matcher is down We also verified that a large-scale identification architecture implementing SPOAN could maintain a high throughput of 500,000 searches/day in a biom etric database containing data on 1.2 billion people VIII F UTURE WORK In the future, we would like to study the performance and accuracy characteristics of biometric identification and how to place replicas using the characteristics of biometric data by evaluating the identification performance and accuracy on actual large-scale biometric data We hope that our practical experience with SPOAN will help us to identify aspects of our replica placement policy that need to be refined A CKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank the reviewers and NEC colleagues for their helpful suggestions and discussions R EFERENCES  J.
