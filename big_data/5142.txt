brought to mobile operators However since the wireless network capacity is a 223nite resource the data tsunami and signaling storm are overwhelming the wireless networks nowadays To prevent network resources from being unexpectedly consumed it requires mobile operators to leverage appropriate strategies of capacity management to meet the ever-increasing network capacity requirements The capacity management in wireless networks refers to a process of ensuring the wireless network is properly sized to meet traf\223c demand and to consume network resources in a most ef\223cient way as much as possible Due to mobile data tsunami mobile operators have suffered unexpected network overloading to various extents over the past years Traditional 
approaches to wireless capacity planning consider one primary factor only which is the subscriber count A generic function is de\223ned as future capacity for traf\223c demand 
current capacity 
 
incremental capacity proportional to subscriber growth Before smart phone appeared devices behaved in a relatively similar manner since applications running on them were voice service and simple data services only The traf\223c model based upon that service scenario is stable and trendable given a period of time When dimensioning networks with a target at forecasting network capacity trends mobile operators used to focus on the overall traf\223c transmitted through the wireless pipes where they also consider coverage 
 
and interferences Due to smart phones with diversi\223ed traf\223c patterns and user behaviors the traditional method for network resource planning based on service traf\223c growth only has failed to solve the dilemma between network capacity and Capital Expenditure CAPEX Hence a scienti\223c approach becomes necessary to forecast network resources and dimension network capacity In particular the method should rely on a joint projection of dynamic changes in the traf\223c model where the subscriber count smart phone user behaviors and service patterns are taken into account in a timely manner This paper introduces a systematic methodology of data analytics and modeling to evaluate Long Term Evolution LTE network capacity based upon traf\223c measurements 
and service trends In this paper  we propose a no v el methodology to trend the dynamic change in the traf\223c model using the historical network measurements and diagnosis data which is due to the diversi\223ed services patterns and user behaviors Such dynamic changes caused by the diversities are then re\224ected in the change of network traf\223c which is ultimately carried by network equipped capacity Furthermore the capacity is supported by end-to-end network equipped resources whose physical threshold upper and lower bound is determined by how different types of traf\223c generated by the diversi\223ed services and devices are effectively utilized on the software and hardware of the network equipment A traf\223c model is developed with parameters that can represent the

statistical characteristics of the network traf\223c and network resources The systematic method should be auto-tunable in computing network capacity to re\224ect the dynamic changes in the traf\223c model The method should be an incremental learning process to identifying the pain points in network capacity management and perform accurate network planning This paper is organized as follows Section II presents the related works for wireless network performance evaluation WOCC 2014

behavior The network structure and topology are constructed via Opnet A few different traf\223c scenarios are simulated in the network to investigate the traf\223c behavior in wireless networks III Q UALITATIVE M ODELING TO E VALUATE LTE N ETWORK P ERFORMANCE The big data analytics leverages true measured data to study a given problem in the wireless networks The measured data from network side or from users faithfully re\224ects the network and user behaviors and the analysis result is more reliable and trustworthy The big data analytics is normally a supervised-learning can be unsupervised also or posterior learning process using the measured data to infer a certain pattern behind the data and reveal unseen situations in a reasonable way In order to solve a given problem on network performance and capacity in UMTS or LTE networks the following steps should be performed using the approach of data analytics and modeling 1 2 Section III presents the proposed novel qualitative modeling for LTE network performance evaluation the relational algorithm and forecasting algorithm is proposed in Section IV Section V shows the numerical results to validate this study and 223nally Section VI draws conclusion II R ELATED W ORKS Wireless network performance service quality and capacity management have been studied by many researchers in both academia and industry Most of the existing research on 2G 3G or LTE networks is performed by various simulation approaches The simulation based approach to study performance and service quality for 3G UMTS network has been widely accepted and recognized in academia le v eraged simulation to design and evaluation of three possible UMTS-WLAN interworking strategies proposed a tree-lik e UMTS terrestrial network where they developed two types of heuristic algorithms to ensure a low magnitude of traf\223c loss in such a network topology One of their algorithms solves the problem by modifying the tree-topology while others expand the network by inserting additional links Their approach showed how to 223nd a good compromise between topology re\223nement and network expansion in the case of realistic network scenarios presented a ne w content-based non-intrusive quality of experience QoE prediction model for low bi-trate and resolution QCIF H.264 encoded videos and to illustrate its application in video quality adaptation over UMTS networks They argued that the success of video applications over UMTS networks very much depends on meeting the QoE requirements of users In their study they performed the simulation via NS2 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation scheme especially at the UMTS access network which is a bottleneck performed an analysis on uplink and do wnlink air interface capacity They de\223ned canonical capacity as the maximum number of concurrent users of that service and de\223ne the network total load as a function of this parameter and the number of concurrent users A number of case studies are also presented to compare the results of utilizing the proposed framework with the results of network simulation This comparison demonstrates the accuracy and usefulness of the proposed approach for network design and dimensioning From UMTS to LTE simulation is considered as a smooth continuation as the most typical approach to study network performance quality and capacity related problems Below are a few typical research on LTE network performance service quality and capacity using simulation based algorithms and tools For example conducted a typical simulation for LTE networks at system level A LTE system level simulator was offered in Matlab to evaluate the downlink shared channel of LTE SISO and MIMO networks using Open Loop Spatial Multiplexing and Transmission Diversity transmit modes conducted a simulation analysis on S1 interface of LTE networks to study the throughput behavior The network structure and topology are constructed via OPNET A few different traf\223c scenarios are simulated in the network to investigate the traf\223c behavior in S1 interface  presented a traf 223c-light-related approach to autonomous self-optimization of tradeoff performance indicators in LTE multi-tier networks Introducing a low-complexity interference approximation model the related optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and is embedded into a self-organized network operation and optimization framework The optimization procedure is carried out considering time-variant optimization

Determine the representation of the input feature for the learned function Data set Model development validation and test primary steps should be followed a Training phase present training data from 216gold standard\216 and train the model by pairing the input network KPIs with expected output target network resource Each algorithm candidate has its own parameter options the number of layers in a Neural Network the number of trees in a Random Forest etc For each of your algorithms we must pick one option That\220s why we have a validation set for us to determine the best option in each algorithm b Validation/test phase now there is a collection of algorithms to predict target network resource A best algorithm should be determined That\220s why we need a test set We may want to pick the algorithm that performs best on the validation set which is good But if not measuring the top-performing algorithm\220s error rate on the test set and just going with its error rate on the validation set then we have blindly mistaken the 216best possible scenario\216 for the 216most likely scenario.\216 Thus this step is to estimate how good the model has been trained and to estimate model properties mean error for predicting network resource classi\223cation errors in classifying network features etc c Application phase apply the freshly-developed model to the new data and get the predictive network resources Since we normally don\220t have any reference value of target network resource in this type of data we can only speculate about the accuracy of predicted network resource using the results of the validation phase IV F ORECASTING LTE N ETWORK P ERFORMANCE A qualitative schematic relation between a given LTE network KPI and its associated network resources is illustrated in Figure 1 In the 223gure the X axis denotes the LTE network resource that is being consumed and the Y axis indicates the measured KPI The LTE KPI as a function of LTE network consumed resources is split in four areas separated by three dotted lines in Fig 1 3 the overall data set is split into training data set and test set Training set is a set of data to discover potentially predictive relationships between independent variables and dependent variables which are target network resources in our case The independent variables and dependent variables in the training set are used together with a supervised or unsupervised learning method to train the relationships between the response value which is a target network resource and the predictors which are the independent variables The training process is to 223t a model that can be used to predict the target network resource from the independent variables selected in step 2 The test set is a set of data with same independent variables and dependent variables that is independent of the training set but that follows the same probability distribution as the training data It is used to assess the strength and utility of the predictive relationship derived by the training set If a model 223t to the training set also 223ts the test set well minimal over-\223tting has taken place If the model 223ts the training set much better than it 223ts the test set over-\223tting is likely the cause 4 Fig 1 Relational model for network KPI and resource Zone 1 Constant good KPI consider a vanishing distribution of LTE network KPI the KPI is 223rst equivalent this step serves to determine structure of the model the learned model and corresponding learning algorithm Several algorithm candidates are selected by domain knowledge to train the relationship between target network resource and network KPIs While performing machine learning to evaluate wireless network capacity this step is to conduct feature selection in which appropriate independent variables are selected Typically the selected input variables are transformed into an independent feature vector which contains the information gain that is descriptive of the object In our case those input variables features are network counters and KPIs showing high correlation to target network resources to be predicted The number of features cannot be too large because of the curse of dimensionality but should contain suf\223cient information gain which is also known as entropy to accurately predict the target network resources 3 3 Factor OVSF Utilization Reference Signal Receive Power RSRP Received Signal Strength Indicator RSSI Received Signal code Power RSCP and CPU Utilization if any 2 B5.3.pd f WOCC 2014

in which many not reside entirely in the main memory Suppose algorithm on approach by further reducing the I/O cost The I/O cost can be reduced in two ways 1 to reduce the number of graphs constructed

Size of Largeincrease The reasons are twofold Firstly when increases according to the node selection scheme to construct decrease There are two reasons Firstly when the memory size increases the stop condition for graph contraction is easier to be satis\336ed since more nodes can 336t in memory Secondly when the memory size increases the costs of the external sorts in both graph contraction and graph expansion phases decrease  Average Degree Number of Largeincreases the time and I/O consumptions for both increases the number of iterations in graph contraction increases This is because when number of edges increases the cost to sort and scan edges in each iteration increases thus more time and I/Os are consumed in each iteration                                     2 4 1 u E  V v E    u v
