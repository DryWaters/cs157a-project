College of Mathematics and Information Science, Northwest Normal University 730070, Lanzhou, P.R.China Abstract One of the best prevention measures against breast cancer is the early tumo r detection in digital mammography Detecting tumor in mammography is a difficult task because of their size and the high content of similar patterns in the image. This brings the necessity of creating automatic tools to find whether a mammography present tumor or not. In this paper we 
join association rule classifier with rough set theory which we call the join ing associative classifier \(JAC to mining digita l mammography. The experimental results shows that this joining associative classifier performance at 77.48% of classifying accuracy which is higher than 69.11% using associative classifier only At the same time, the number of rules decreased distinctively. Moreover, the experiments we conducted demonstrate the use and ef fectiveness of association rule mining in image categorization 
 1. Introduction  Breast cancer is the second cause of death in women in the world. This is why breast cancer is considered a public health problem. Currently there are no methods to prevent breast cancer, which is why early detection represents a very important factor in cancer treatment and allows reaching a high survival rate Mammography is considered the most reliable method in early detection of breast cancer. Due to the high volume of mammograms to be read by physicians, the 
accuracy rate tends to decrease, and automatic reading   This paper is supported by national science foundation No 60373108 of digital mammograms becomes highly desirable That is why the computer aided diagnosis systems are necessary to assist the medical staff to achieve high efficiency and effectiveness [1 A lot of efforts have been done to solve this problem the authors use data m ining t echniques 
to detect and classify anomalies in the breast. They use neural networks and association rules as the data mining algorithms. They also use a histogram equalization process to enhance the image contrast and then they perform a feature extraction process and include those features combined with patients information for the classification task. Their results were of 82.248% with neural network and 69.11 with association rules. But one noticeable advantage of the association rule-based classifier is the time required for training, which is very low compared to other 
me   the authors use a Bayesian network to find and classify regions of interest In this research they use a segmentation algorithm based on wavelet transforms and the use of a threshold that corresponding to the local minimum of the image In 3 the authors present a method for feature extraction of lesions in mammograms using  an edge based segmentation algorith m we find an 
evaluation of different methods that can be used to get texture features from regions of interest extracted from mammogram im wavelet transformation has been used to detect groups of micro-calcifications in digital mammograms. In addition, some other methods were presented in the  and Markov models and neural networks [8 W i th all this effort, there is still no widely used method to classify 


medical images. This is because this medical domain requires high accuracy and low training time Association rule mining is one of the most important tasks in data mining and it has been extensively studied and applied to market basket  rule mining method for classify anomalies in the breast. But their classify accuracy was only 69.11%. In this paper we present a new cl assification method for medical images based on association rule mining algorithmÑApriori and rough set theory which we call the joining associative classifier \(JAC\on real the Mam m ographic Im age Analysis Society\t 77.48% classify accuracy which is higher than 69.11% using Apriori algorithm only  The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 describes the images pre-processing phase and the feature extraction phase. Section 3 presents the new association rule-based classifierÑ joining associative classifier \(JAC our experiments and results. Finally, in section 5, we show our conclusions and future work 2.Data Pre-processing and Feature Extraction This section summarizes the techniques used to enhance the mammograms as well as the features that were extracted from images To compare with we use almost same experimental methods as it 2.1. Data Pre-processing Pre-processing is always a necessity whenever the data to be mined in noisy inconsistent or incomplete Pre-processing significantly improves the effectiveness of data mi The type size of the images in MIAS was 1024x1024 and almost 50 of the whole image comprised the background with a lot of noise. In addition, these images are scanned at different illumination conditions, and therefore some images appeared too bright and some were too dark The first step toward noise removal was pruning the images with a cropping operation. The second step was an image enhancement. Thus, we eliminated almost all the background information and most of the noise. An example of cropping that elim inates the artefacts and the black background is given in Figure 1 \(a-b Since the resulting images had different sizes, the x and the y coordinates were normalized to a value between 0 and 255. The cropping operation was done automatically by sweeping horizontally through the image Then we applied the Histogram Equalization method to enhance the image in order to diminish the effect of over-brightness or over-darkness in images Histogram Equalization increases the contrast range in an image by increasing the dynamic range of grey levels Figure 1 \(c ple of histogram equalizati on result after cropping a b c Fig 1  Pre-processing phase on an example image a\age; \(b\age;\(c image based on histogram equalization 2.2. Feature Extraction After pre-processing the images, features relevant to the classification are extracted from the cleaned images. The extracted features are organized in a database, which is the input for the mining phase of the classifier. This database is also constructed by merging some already existing features like the type of the tissue dense fatty and fatty-glandular location of the abnormality \(like the center of a circle surrounding the tumor features are four statistical parameters mean  variance  skewness and kurtosis  The formula for the statistical parameters computed is the following Mean 1  N kf k k f pf 1 Variance 22 1  N kf k  k f pf 2 Skewness  3 3 3 1 1  N kf k  k f pf 3 Kurtosis 4 4 4 1 1  N kf k  k f pf 4 Where N denotes the number of gray levels in the mammogram k f the k th gray level and   fk k pf nn where is the number of pixels with k n k f gray level and n is the total number of pixels in the region All these extracted features are computed over smaller windows of the original image. The original image is first split in four parts. For a more accurate extraction of the features we split each of these four 


regions in other four parts. The statistical parameters were computed for each of the sixteen sub-parts of the original im statistical features 3.  Joining Associative Classifier In this section we propose to execute behind to the Apriori algorithm the Rough Set Theory in order to discover strong dependencies that can, in general be useful to reduce the original set of attributes and obtain more powerful rules to classify the concept. The following are the basic concepts of the rough set theory and association rules 3.1. Rough Set Theory The original Rough Set Theory was proposed by  14 This theory is concerned with analysis of deterministic data dependencies Definition 1.  Information Systems In the Rough Set Theory, information systems are used to represent knowledge. An information system S  U  A  V  f  consists of U a nonempty, finite set named universe which is a set of objects U  x 1 x x  2m A a nonempty, finite set of attributes  A C D in which C is the set of condition attributes and D is the set of decision attributes  V V is the domain of a  Va aA f  U  A V an information function For each a A and x U an information function f  x  a  Va is defined, which means that for each object x in U  f specify its attribute value Definition 2.  Lower and Upper Approximation Due to imprecision which exists in the real world data there are always conflicting objects contained in a decision table. Here conflicting objects refers to two or more objects that are undisti nguishable by employing any set of condition attri butes, but they belong to different decision classes. Such objects are called inconsistent Such a decision table is called inconsistent decision table In the rough set theory, the approximations of sets are introduced to deal with inconsistency. If S  U  A  V  f  suppose B A and XU then the B-lower and Bupper approximation s of X are defined as       B XYUINDBY  X       BX Y U INDB Y X   Here U/IND\(B denotes the family of all equivalence classes of B  IND  B   x  y  U  U  a B f  x  a  f  y  a  B-indiscernibility relation  B X is the set of all elements of U which can be certainty classified as elements of X employing the set of attributes B The Positive Region of X is defined as POS  X  B  B X 5  B X is the set of elements of U which can be possibly classified as elements of X using the set of attributes B The set    B B nd X B X B X is called the B-boundary of X If  B Bnd X then we say that X is  definable on B otherwise we say that X is non-definable on B which is also named as rough set  14  3.2. Association Rules The purpose of association di scovery is to find items that imply the presence of other items. An association rule is form Let 12     n I ii i be a set of literals called items Let D be a set of transactions, each transaction TI  An association rule is an implication of the form X Y where X I and YI and X Y  The rule X Y holds in the transaction set D with confidence c if c of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y  The rule X Y holds in the transaction set D with support s if s of transactions in D contain XY  Give a set of transaction D the problem of mining association rules is to gene rate all association rules that have support and confidence greater than the userspecified minimum support min-sup inimum confidence min-conf  association rules two steps are required 1 Find the large itemsets for a given min-sup 2\pute rules for a given min-conf based on the itemsets obtained before  In this paper, we are based on the Apriori algorithm and rough set theory to obtain the association rules 3.3 The Algorithm of Joining Associative Classifier Algorithm Joining Associative Classifier JAC Input  S the input decision data table. The set of attributes A will be divided in condition attribute set C and decision attribute set D   min-conf the minimum confidence for rules  n maximum number of condition allowed in the antecendent of the rules Output Data mining rule set  Str D 


We will assume that input table S has been discretized and binarized. The process that will be performed is as follows Step1 Execute the Apriori algorith m on the input data table S Internally the algor ithm will calculate the size of large itemsets k depending on the nature of S We call this new set of rules  ass S Step2 Delete all those rules in which the decision attribute occurs as part of their antecedent ass S Step3 If such that then is superfluous attribute so that it can be removed from A Remove also such rules from  ik k AD ik A ass S Step4.  Analyse of the rules in the new This set of rules contains two kinds of rules that we have called strong classification rules and meta-rules  The former is composed by all those rules in which the consequent is some with confidence min-conf The latter is a set containing rules that will allow us to reduce the number of condition attributes ass S ass S i D  Include strong classification rules in the output data mining rule set  Str D Those association rules in meta-rules that only contain condition attr ibutes have to be taken into account as they highlight dependencies among condition attributes. We will call this set of rules  red S Step5. Reduce A taking into account the rules in  red S Step6.Execute the Positive Region algorithm to obtain a set of rules that will be included in output data mining rule set s tr D  4.  Experimental Results This section introduces the data collection that we used and the experimental resul ts obtained using the joining associativ e classifier proposed 4.1.  Mammography Collection The data collection that was used in our experiments was taken from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society \(MIAS This sam e collection has been used  It consists of 322 im ages which belong to three big categories normal, benign and malign. There are 208 normal images, 63 benign and 51malign which are considered abnormal. In addition, the abnormal cases are further divided in six categories microcalcification, circumscribed masses speculated masses ill-defined masses, architectu ral distortion and asymmetry All the images also include the locations of any abnormalities that may be present. The existing data in the collection cons ists of the location of the abnormality  like the center of a circle surrounding the tumor its radius breast position right or left of breast tissues \( fatty, fat ty-glandular and dense tumor type if it exists \( benign or malign\the mammograms are medio-lat eral oblique view We selected this dataset because it is freely available, and to be able to compare our method with other published  is a com m only used database for mammography categorization 4.2  Experimental Results We used the 10 fold cross validation techniques to evaluate the algorithm performance We divided the features database in ten splits. For each split we selected about 90% of the data set for training and the rest for testing. That is 288 images in the training set and 34 images in the testing set. The features database is composed with the extracted features and the existing data of 322 images in MIAS. All the numeric attributes are discrete using algorithm In the training phase, the joining associative classifier was applied on the training data and the set of association rules were extracted. Then, for an image in the testing set, the classification process searches in Table 1 The comparison of two algorithm on MIAS this set of rules for finding the class that is the closest to be attached with the object presented for categorization Apriori JAC  Ten splits rules accuracy rules accuracy 1 965 63.705 66 69.342 2 1080 67.648 98 86.373 3 1005 80.412 71 77.586 4 847 64.705 85 72.912 5 1782 64.705 74 78.224 6 1201 67.642 70 77.055 7 1359 88.205 69 77.691 8 895 64.721 80 73.752 9 1383 66.512 73 82.123 10 1366 62.901 76 79.819 average 1188 69.11 76 77.48 The support was set to 10% and the confidence to 3 The reason for choosing the 3% percent for the confidence is motivated by the fact that the database has more normal cases \(about 70 table 1, we got 77.48% classify accuracy result with the joining associative classifier than 69.11% with the  At the sam e tim e the number of rules decreased distinctively 


In table 1 the first column is the ten splits of dataset. The second and third columns are the number of rules and classify accuracy on Apriori. Then , the forth and fifth columns are the  number  of  rules  and classify accuracy on JAC We also present the positiv e predictive and the negative predictive graphs in Figure 2 to show that both false positive and false negative are very small for normal cases which means that for abnormal images we have a very small number of false negative which is very desirable in medical classification. The formula for the positive predictive and the negative predictive are given below Positive predictive=TP/\(TP+FP 6 Negative predictive =TN/\(TN+FN 7 Where TP stands for true positives, FP for false positives FN for false negatives and TN for true negatives. In addition, we can notice from equations 6 and 7 that the values for FP and FN tend to zero when the positive predictive and th e negative predictive tend to 100%. Thus, from the Figure 2, we can see that the positives predictive and in particular the negative predictive are almost 100% with our approach which means that the classification in just normal and abnormal categories was actually high                                  Fig 2  Positive and negative predictive over the ten splits The experiment is made on a computer with single 996MHz Pentium 3 CPU and 256MB memory and the JAC program is written in Bo rland C++ Builder 6. The source program of Apriori is downloaded from  5. Conclusions In this paper, we presented a cooperative association classify method applied to medical image classification. This joining associative classifier is based on the association rule mining algorithm--Apriori and the rough set theory. This approach provides a sound basis for the definition of a new cooperative algorithm to obt ain comprehensible rules while avoiding the comput ational complexity of classical predictive methods. In addition we demonstrated how important the image pre-processing phase is in building a classifier. The evaluation of the classifier was carried out on MIAS dataset and experimental results show that the accuracy of the joining associative classifier reaches 77.48% than 69.11% which execute Aprio ri algorithm itself in And the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value tend to 100% in more than half the splits. There are some future research directions to be studied To cooperate with medical staff would get more interesting results. In ad dition, the extraction of different features or a different database organization could lead to improved results 6.

Conclusion  In this paper, we presented the XQuery expression of the FP-growth method from XML data We use the FP-growth algorithm to generate the large itemset document, and then select all association rules from the large item set where support is greater than or equal to the minimum support. We have proposed frequent pattern tree \(FP-tree growth method, FP-growth. There are several advantages of FP-growth over other approaches. It constructs a highly compact FP-tree, which is usually substantially smaller than the original database, and thus saves the costly database scans in the subsequent mining processes. It applies a pattern growth method which avoids costly candidate generation and test by successively concatenating frequent 1-itemset found in the \(conditional divide-and-conquer method which dramatically reduces the size of the subsequent conditional pattern bases and conditional FP-trees. To our knowledge, the FP-growth method has been implemented using the query language XQuery, without pre-processing or post-processing of the data. Many issues remain open, one of the issues concerns the structure of the XML data. Since the structure of the XML data can be  very complex and irregular, identifying the mining context on such XML data becomes difficult. Our current and future research in this area focuses on investigating what other standard data mining algorithms can be expressed in XQuery  References  1] PMML 2.1 Predictive Model Markup Language http://www.dmg.org, March 2003 2] World Wide Web Consortium.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
