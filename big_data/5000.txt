TABLE I Load Balance Evaluation  size of global sliding window  update granularity  and number of peer nodes are used in this experiment Table I gives the exclusive cpu time per update for updating the skyline computation of the 10 peer nodes As can be seen from the table the proposed algorithm can achieve good load balance among all the peer nodes in CPM and DPM In Algorithm 1 the monitor node divides the data fairly according to the capabilities of the peer nodes which contributes to the ideal query load balancing Since the streaming data is continuously arrived and sometimes a batch of items may arrive at a time thus we need to evaluate the performance with the number of the arrivals at a time To evaluate the effect of the numbers in our experiments we vary from 1 to  As shown in Fig 6 we can see that the time per update for two models increases as increases for both the synthetic and real data due to the time-consuming for the query updating for the larger number of arrivals Nevertheless we also nd that the time is not linearly increasing as the increase of  This is probably a consequence of that when is small the communication overhead increases due to the frequent data transmission whereas when is large the vast number of dominating tests increase the computation overhead Update granularity Furthermore as shown in Fig 6 we can nd that the performance of DPM is better than CPM which stems from that the computation of the skyline probabilities for the new arrivals is only occupied by a peer node in CPM while in DPM the tasks are executed by all peer nodes Thus the computation is improved especially in the cloud environment To be more obviously evaluate the models we choose 100 as the default value for the remaining tests Moreover from Fig 6 we can also see that the performances of CPM and DPM in two types of synthetic data are close this is probably the consequence of that we compute the dominating probabilities for new items and update the skyline probabilities based on the complete dominance tests in the models Therefore in the following experiments we only use Independent data to evaluate our proposals To evaluate the scalability of the models we test the performances of the models with different number of peer nodes From Fig 7\(a we can see that the time per update for continuous uncertain skyline queries in each model is reduced when the number of peer nodes increases from to  The results con“rm that the more peer nodes are adopted to parallelize the query the more improvement will be especially for the query over the large sliding window Therefore we believe that the proposed models are scalable Fig 7 Performance Peer number Moreover from Fig 7\(b we can see that the performance which is measured by the number of items updated per second is improved as the increase of the number of nodes Nevertheless the growths are relatively slowly compared with the growth rates of peer numbers The main reason is that the size of each local window decreases gradually with the increase node number thus the computational overhead on each node decreases whereas the communication overhead increases which affects the performance of the models To evaluate the adaptivity of the framework for the size of the global sliding window wevary from to  Moreover we assign the global window to local windows with equal sizes to achieve the goal of load balance as far as possible From the experiments we nd that framework can effectively process the queries even when the sliding window is large As shown in Fig 8 the overall time per update increases when we vary the size of global window from to  This is nature as that the larger size of the global window

Fig 8 Performance Window size is the more recent stream items that need to be maintained will be thus the computation overhead including the cost for updating the existing items and the cost for computing the skyline probabilities for new arrivals increases Furthermore as it is expected the performance of DPM is better than CPM due to the more parallelism for computing the skyline probabilities of the new arrivals V C ONCLUSION Nowadays parallel query processing over data streams has received considerable attention in academic and commercial areas but it poses an immense challenge to researchers In this paper we present a general framework GPS for parallel queries over data streams for distributed computing environments with high performance 22 especially for the cloud computing environments To the best of our knowledge it is the rst work to study the problem Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GPS is effective and practical As future work it is interesting and challenging to improve the framework in several aspects such as the index techniques and interface standardization of the framework Moreover we will test the performance of the framework for other queries such as uncertain topqueries and the queries over the graphical streaming data Additionally we are currently studying the fault-tolerant techniques for parallel query processing over uncertain data streams based on the proposed framework GPS A CKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported by the National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China Grant No.2011CB302601 the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant No.61379052 the National High Technology Research and Development 863 Program of China Grant No.2013AA01A213 the Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hunan Province Grant No.S2010J5050 Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education Grant No.20124307110015 R EFERENCES  C Aggarw al and P  Y u On inde xing high dimensional data with uncertainty in
