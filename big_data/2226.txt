An Ef?cient Multi-keyword Ranked Retrieval\nScheme with Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform\nOver Encrypted Cloud Data\nKe Li, Weiming Zhang, Ke Tian, Rundong Liu and Nenghai Yu\nAbstract—Cloud computing is becoming more and more pop-\nular recently, and this trend encourages large corporations and\ncompanies to outsource their data to a remote cloud server.\nHowever, the concern of data privacy and security is a huge\nproblem which impedes the development of cloud computing. It\nis essential and necessary to propose a scheme to realize the\ninformation retrieval and protect the data privacy at the same\ntime. Since ranked multi-keyword search is a pretty practical\nquestion in this area and it has a signi?cant in?uence on\nthe user experience, we would mainly focus on the scheme to\nachieve high performance and low cost multi-keyword ranked\nsearch. In this paper, we proposed a novel search scheme\nwith Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform \(J-L scheme for short optimised maximum query” to live\nup to our ef?ciency demand. Furthermore, we established a\ncomplete system to guarantee a set of strict privacy requirements.\nExtensive experiments on real-world database are presented to\nshow our proposed scheme’s ef?ciency and accuracy.\nKeywords—multi-keyword ranked search, privacy preserving,\ncloud computing\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCloud computing is prevalent in our daily life everywhere.\nThe long-held dream of computing as a utility, has a signi?cant\nin?uence on the IT industry and makes the software more\nattractive and shapes the way of everyone’s life [1]. In fact,\ncloud computing is de?ned as a colloquial expression which\nis used to describe a variety of different computing concepts\nwhich involve plenty of computers that are connected through\na real-time communication network. Moreover, companies\nand corporations with large computing tasks are motivated\nto outsource the dif?cult tasks to cloud server to make the\nbest of cloud’s high performance computing capacity. These\ndata owners would also like to store data into cloud server for\nconvenience and low storage cost. In a word, we can anticipate\nthe huge potential of the cloud computing development.\nEven though cloud computing grows rapidly, there are\nstill large number of people afraid of using cloud computing\nanyway. They mainly concern about data privacy in the cloud\ncomputing especially data abuse and information leakage\n[2]. Internet companies \(such as Amazon, Google, Dropbox service to attract customers.\nBut considering that these companies may take advantage of\npersonal data, such as personal health record, for commercial\npro?t probably, we could not completely trust the cloud server.\nIn order to protect data privacy, we need to encrypt the\ndata before outsourcing them to a commercial cloud server.\nAfter encrypting the data, we will confront a huge challenge\nabout how to analyze this data especially how to search the\ninteresting keywords. Information Retrieval \(IR problem and basic demand for mass data use.\nHowever, traditional symmetric encryption demand users to\ndownload all the data, decrypt all, and then search keywords\nlike plaintext retrieval. This method not only costs user plenty\nof time but also is rather impractical. Thus achieving privacy\npreserving and effective keyword search in the encrypted cloud\ndatabase is rather important.\nIn order to meet ef?ciency demand of information retrieval,\nSearch Encryption \(SE  to large scale data\nwill cause space and time disadvantages. Therefore, building\na secure and ef?cient search index [4] [5] is necessary. In\nthis paper we mostly concentrate on multi-keyword ranked\nsearch because when user executes the information retrieval,\nhe/she will only wants the most related documents. Therefore,\nhow to make an ef?cient index and sort the search results is\nsigni?cant prominent in our work. Former works have adopt\ndifferent techniques [6]-[10]. D.Song et al. [11] have ?rstly\nproposed a scheme only supporting single Boolean keyword\nsearch, which is regarded as “coordinate matching”. C.Wang et\nal [6] introduced order preserving encryption\(OPE on the OPE, J. Xu et al [10] proposed Two-\nStep-Ranking to ful?ll multi-keyword ranked search. Even\nthough OPE have protected keyword frequency, it will still\nleak the relationship of frequency comparison. Furthermore N.\nCao et al [7] proposed multi-keyword ranked search scheme\ncalled MRSE based on secure KNN computation. In MRSE\nscheme, N. Cao adopted the space vector model to build the\nindex, which means that all of the keywords are de?ned in\na prebuilt dictionary and every keyword is identi?ed by its\nlocation in the dictionary. Each article is corresponding to\na vector and each position in the vector represents whether\nor not the corresponding keyword is in this article. Then\nsymmetric encryption \(like DES [12], AES [13 for\nencrypting the documents and two random inverted matrixes\nare used for encrypting the index. Furthermore MRSE applies\nan internal ranking algorithm by using the inner product\nof two query vectors to determine the most related top-k\nresults. However, this approach has several drawbacks. The\nmost important one is the space consume, the total space\nconsume will increase extremely rapidly when the number of\nkeywords in the dictionary increases. Secondly, MRSE does\n2013 International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data\n978-1-4799-2829-3/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.37\n32030 9 4 31 4\nnot take keyword frequency into consideration, so the ?les\nwhich contain heavy frequencies might not be included in 


top\nreturned results due to the MRSE method. Thirdly, MRSE\ndoesn’t support index update ef?ciently. For each new keyword\nto be added to the dictionary, the whole index has to be rebuilt.\nZ. Xu et al [8] proposed MKQE based on the MRSE to\nimprove the ef?ciency for updating function, but MKQE also\ndid not solve the space consume problem very well.\nIn this paper, we applied Johnson-Lindenstrauss \(JL  multi-keyword ranked search. Since this ?eld\nused to be dominated by the OPE method and secure-KNN\nmethod, we are pretty motivated to introduce JL transform\ntechnique and present its potential application in this eld.\nDirectly applying JL transform cannot get high ef?ciency as\nwe need, so we adjust this technique and improve its algorithm\nto match the ef?ciency and security demand. To our best\nknowledge, it is the ?rst time that JL transform is introduced to\nprovide a solution for the multi-keyword ranked search. Then\nwe propose Optimized Maximum Query” method to make an\nef?cient trapdoor and conquer the problem of low accuracy by\ndirectly using JL transform to search. The experiment result\non real-world data set shows that our scheme not only guar-\nantees the ef?ciency, but also reduces the space complexity\nsigni?cantly. Our scheme is ?exible and the parameters can\nbe selected with different demand of ef?ciency and accuracy.\nIn summary, our contribution can be listed as follows:\n• We proposed an ef?cient scheme based on JL transform\nto solve the multi-keyword ranked search problem for the\n?rst time.\n• Our scheme signi?cantly reduces the space complexity\nand guarantees the ef?ciency according to the experi-\nments.\n• The paraments in our scheme is exible and we show\nthat potential of application of JL transform in research\nand practical areas is unlimited.\nThe rest of our paper is organized as follows: we will\ndescribe the basic system model and privacy requirements in\nSection II. In section III, we will elaborate the JL transform\nbased scheme \(J-L scheme some analysis. We present\nthe experiment results in Section IV and draw a conclusion in\nSection V.\nII. PROBLEM FORMULATION\nIn this Section, we will concentrate on de?ning the problem.\nWe will describe our searching system model and the privacy\nrequirements based on the analysis. Then we will describe\nsome preliminaries related to our work.\nA. System model\nDifferent from traditional plaintext information retrieval,\nthe encrypted database retrieval in cloud computing always\nhave three entities:data owner, remote cloud server and users.\nThe data owner can be divided into individuals or corpo-\nrations who own a collection of n plain document les\n\b\t\n\b\t\n\f t\b\n\n\b\t\n\t\b\n\b  b\n b\t \b\t\nFig. 1. System Framework of multi-keyword ranked search\nD = {D1, D2 . . . Dn} . To guarantee privacy and secu-\nrity, the data owner encrypts the plaintext ?les into ? =\n{E1, E2, E3 . . . En} and outsource them to a remote cloud\nserver with index I to support the multi-keyword ranked\nsearch where I is built from the ?le collections.\nTo search over the encrypted ?les ?, a data user will ?rstly\nmake a query Q consisted of the interesting keywords he/she\nwant to search and turn Q into trapdoor T using encryption\nkeys The cloud server will receive T and search it through\nan existed index I, then the server will ?nd the matched les\nand sort them by the matching scores. Furthermore, the cloud\nserver return top-k ID set  = {ID1, ID2 IDk}. With ,\nthe server can easily ?nd the corresponding ?les, and then\nreturn the result R which includes the required encrypted\n?les.Finally the data user decrypts R and gets the plaintext\n?les. Since all the procedures are isolated from cloud servers,\nthe cloud server will neither know the keywords the user\nsearch nor the exact information of returned ?les.\nThe whole framework can be divided into four core algo-\nrithms which is shown as follows:\n• KenGen\nThe data owner generates encryption keys K for building\nsearchable encryption index and traditional symmetric\nkeys K? for encrypting and decrypting ?les. The keys\nare shared with the owner and users by secure commu-\nnication protocols.\n• BuildIndex\nThe data owner builds a privacy-protecting index I sup-\nporting multi-keyword ranked search from the database D\nbased on K with JL transform. After building the index,\n321\nthe owner can send both I and encrypted ? to cloud\nserver.\n TrapGen\nThe data user generate the trapdoor T according to the\nquery Q including the interesting terms.\n Search\nThe cloud server compares the T with each entry in I\nand return the matched result R to the user.\nWe will talk more in details about how to adopt JL transform\nto make an ef?cient and secure index, and how to make\na corresponding trapdoor to get most matched results.The\nfollowing is a set of notations.\nB. Notations\n D: the set of total n original plaintext ?les. D is denoted\nas D = {D1, D2 . . . Dn}.\n• ?: the set of the encrypted ?les, corresponding to the plain\ntext ?les D, and ? is donated as ? = {E1, E2, E3 . . . En}.\n• W the set of total m keywords in the the dictionary, and\nW is presented as W = {W1,W2,W3 . . .Wm}.\n• I: the secure index I built by using JL transform. Ii\nis corresponding to the ?le Di. I is denoted as I =\n{I1, I2, I3 In}.\n• Q: the vector which is consisted of the interesting key-\nwords the user want to search.\n• T : the 


trapdoor, built from a query Q, prepared to be\nsent to the cloud server.\n• : the list of the ?les IDs from returned matched result,\nand  is denoted as  = {ID1, ID2 . . . IDk}.\nC. Privacy requirements\nGenerally, the cloud server model is considered as “semi-\nhonest”, also called “honest-but-curious” [18]. Speci?cally,\na cloud server will not remove encrypted data ?les or in-\ndex from the storage.Besides it will also correctly follow\nthe designated protocol speci?cation and execute the pro-\ncedure correctly. However, it is curious to infer more da-\nta \(including trapdoor and index private information. There\nare two threat models “Known Ciphertext Model” and\n“Known Background Model 7].\n“Known Ciphertexrt Model” assumes the cloud serv-\ner only knows the encrypted ?les and the index. Since our ?les\nand index are both encrypted, without decryption keys, there\nis no computational possibility for the cloud server to know\nthe exact content of the ?les.\n“Known Background Model” means that the cloud\nserver is strong to possess much more knowledge. The server\nmight intentionally collect the statistical information about\nqueries. Because JL transform can leak the Euclidean distance\nbetween the two vectors, the cloud server will know the\nEuclidean distance similarity among the entries in the index.\nFurthermore, the cloud server might have the capacity to infer\nwhich ?les contains a certain keyword through calculating\nand guessing the correlation relationship of search requests.\nHowever, the server will almost never infer exact frequency\nof each term in the encrypted index.\nIn our scheme, the ?les are protected by AES encryption,\nwhich can be considered secure. We focus on privacy of the\nindex and trapdoor. And we expect the index and trapdoor\nshould leak as less information as possible. In MRSE, the\nauthor protects the privacy by multiplying two large matrix.\nIn our scheme, we introduce a more ef?cient scheme – JL\ntransform to encrypt the index. Furthermore we ensure the\ntrapdoor privacy by guarantee that the same query generate\ndifferent trapdoors at different time thus the cloud server will\nbe unable to deduce the relationship between trapdoors. This\nproperty is also de?ned as “trapdoor unlinkability”.\nIII. PROPOSED SCHEME\nIn this section, we will talk about the creativity ef?ciency\nand security of JL transform based scheme \(J-L scheme for\nshort scheme, different from the MRSE and MKQE\nschemes, which use “inner product similarity” to quantitatively\nevaluate the coordinate matching, we use the Euclidean dis-\ntance to evaluate the matching scores of two vectors. In MRSE,\nthe author calculates a secure index which is consisted of a set\nof vectors and each vector is corresponding to each ?le based\non the keywords the ?le contains. Each vector has m bits m\nis the total number of keywords in the dictionary. But when\nwe consider the situation that ?les are stored in the cloud,\nMRSE will confront the huge space consume problem and\nthis disadvantage will prevent MRSE from being applied to the\npractical industry use. To solve this problem, in our scheme,\neach vector also presents each ?le, but we can reduce the\ndimension of a vector signi?cantly by applying JL transform.\nHowever, we would face another challenge about how to\ncompare the similarity of two vectors using the Euclidean\ndistance after the dimensionality reduction. We then proposed\na novel method called “Optimized Maximum Query” to\ngenerate an ef?cient trapdoor. Such trapdoor can return top-k\nmatched results more accurately.\nB. Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform\nOur key idea of dimensionality reduction rises from\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss lemma: “If points in a vector space\nare projected onto a randomly selected subspace of suitable\nhigh dimension, then the distance between the points are\napproximately preserved.” This random projection has been\nshown to have promising theoretical properties because using\nJL transform can keep the accuracy as the original method\nand at the same time reduce the dimensionality. The detailed\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss lemma is as follows:\nLemma 1. Given  > 0 and an integer n, let b be a another\npositive integer to satisfy b  b0 = O\(?2logn points that u,v ? Rm, there exists a map\nfunction f : Rm ? Rb, where f\(u v 1 f\(u v 1 Eucildean space can be embedded into b-\ndimensional Eucildean space, where b is logarithmic in n and\nindependent of m. Furthermore the privacy via JL transform\nis discussed detail elaboratively in [17]. K Kenthap et al\n[17] concentrate on the problem whether it is possible for\nparty A to publish some information about each user so that\nparty B can estimate the distance between users without being\nable to infer any private bit of a user. Their method, which\ninvolves projecting each users representation into a random,\nlower-dimensional space via a sparse JL transform and then\nadding Gaussian noise to each entry of the lower-dimensional\nrepresentation, can preserve different degree of privacy where\nmore privacy is desired, the larger the variance of the Gaussian\nnoise is.\nIn this paper, we will combine JL transform with random-\nized matrix to meet best privacy request. Then in order to\nget the best performance, the constraint of b must satisfy\n: b  b0 = O\(?2logn linear\ntransformation represented by m× b matrix R. Choice of the\nrandom matrix R is our key interest. In order to satisfy the\nLemma 1, the R must hold the following constraints:\n• The columns of the random matrix R 


are composed of\northonormal vectors with unit length\n• The element ri,j in R have zero mean and unit variance.\n1 the dimensionality\nreduction, and these ways all depend on the properties of the\ndata that need to to preserved. Our choice of the matrix is\nguided by the two main factors: ef?ciency and security.\n• Each entry of the matrix R is chosen independently from\na Normal distribution with the mean 0 and ?2 = 1b , where\n? is standard deviation.\n• Each entry of the matrix R is chosen independently and\nuniformly from {? 1?\nb\n,+ 1?\nb\n randomly.\n• Each entry of the matrix is chosen independently\nto be {?\n?\n3\nb , 0,+\n?\n3\nb} with corresponding probability\n{ 16 , 23 , 16} respectively.\n• The sparse projection matrix of Dasgupta et al. [16] .\nIn our J-L scheme, we choose the ?rst method as our\nstandard one to generate the projection matrix R and we will\nalso add the random matrix into the index I to enhance the\nsecurity.\nC. Making ef?cient and secure index\nThe goal of building the index is generating an algorithm to\ntransform the original plaintext index into a privacy-preserving\nsketch and recover distances between original ones from\ntransformed sketches.\nOur algorithms can be expressed as follows: ?rst of all, we\nbuild a plaintext index from a set of ?les. During building the\nindex, we consider the term weight which is not included in\nMRSE. Instead, we calculate w\(i, j to represent the score\nweight in jth term in ith document using TF-IDF [19]\nmethod. This index is de?ned as n×m matrix P which rows\nare corresponding to ?les and columns are corresponding to\nkeywords listed in the dictionary. w\(i, j i, j 1 + log\(TFi,j 1 frequency number of jth term in ith\ndocument, n stands for the total number of documents and\nDFj represents the number of documents including the jth\nterm. By adopting TF-IDF method, each position in the index\nwill contain more weight information. That is an improvement\ncompared with MRSE that each position only is occupied by\n0 or 1 .\nBut considering the real-world database, the P is rather\nsparse because each ?le will only include a very small pro-\nportion keywords in the whole keywords dictionary. Therefore,\nthere will plenty of zeros in the index. It is essential for us\nto introduce the random disturbance to covers the positions\nwhich are embedded by zeros. We use ? as the noise matrix\nwhich is selected from a uniform distribution with the arrange\nfrom \(0, ?], where ? is the maximum in the range. And we\nplus it to the plaintext index P. Secondly we generate the\nprojection JL transform matrix R in which each entry of the\nmatrix R is chosen independently from a normal distribution\nwith mean 0 and ?2 = 1b . Then, we get the secure index I by\nmultiply two matrixes The details are shown in Alg.1.\nIntuitively, given the level of desired privacy, the dimension\nb will affect the performance and utility of our J-L scheme\nsigni?cantly. On the one hand, if b gets smaller, we will have\na lower space consume, but the distance between two vectors\nwill have more deviations after JL transform because the ?0\nwill become larger. On the other hand, as b gets larger, the\nspace and computation consume will increase rapidly. Finding\nthe optimal value for the dimension b is challenging and\nimportant theoretically And we will show different b with\ndifferent experiment results in the next section.\nD. Euclidean distance search\nBefore introducing how to make an ef?cient trapdoor, we\n?rstly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the\nEuclidean distance to match top-k results. Euclidean distance\nis unlike MRSE or other methods using “inner product similar-\nity” or “cosine similarity” which is a judgement of orientation\nand not magnitude. We choose the “cosine similarity” for an\nexample, two vectors with the same orientation will have a co-\nsine similarity of 1, two vectors at angle 90 will have a cosine\nsimilarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have\na similarity of -1, which is independent of their magnitude.\nHowever, the Euclidean distance is the “ordinary” distance\nbetween two points that one would measure with a ruler, and is\ngiven by the Pythagorean formula [22]. The Euclidean distance\ncan be regarded as the length of the line segment connecting\ntwo points and is affected by the magnitude of the two vectors.\nGiven two vectors p and q , the Euclidean distance can be\npresented as:\n323\nAlgorithm 1 Build The Secure Index\nInput:\nPlaintext index with frequency whose rows corresponding\n?les and columns corresponding to keywords listed in the\ndictionary, this index is de?ned as n×m matrix P ;\nPrivacy paraments , ?;\nProject dimension b;\nOutput:\nProjection Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform matrix R;\nPrivacy-preserving encrypted index, which is de?ned as\nn× b matrix I;\n1: initialize R = Ø;\n2: initialize I = Ø;\n3: generate the projection Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform\nm× b matrix R ;\n4: to protect the privacy and reduce the zeros existed in the\nP, generate the noise n×m matrix n5: P? = P+?;\n6: I = P?R;\n7: construct the n× b index matrix I ;\n8: publish\(I,R p, q p1 ? q1 p2 ? q2 pm ? qm pi ? qi 2 follows:\nd1\(p, q pi × qi 3 inner product similarity can be shown as follows:\nd2\(p, q 4 infer that even though the\nvectors are in the same orientation, their Euclidean distance\ncan also be pretty large because Euclidean distance is easily\naffected by the magnitude of elements in the vector. We will\ngive a 


simple example to demonstrate this problem.It is not\nhard to notice that in the ?eld of multi-keyword ranked search\nover encrypted database, this is a novel and dif?cult problem.\nIn order to get high search ef?ciency we proposed Optimized\nMaximum Query to solve this problem.\nTable I is a simple example of relevance score index in the\npalintext. The rows are corresponding to ?les and the columns\nare corresponding to the keywords Let’s give a query q =\n{0, 1, 0, 1}, which means that the second and fourth term is\nour interesting words.\nw1 w2 w3 w4\nFile1 1.5 0 1.6 1.2\nFile2 0 2.5 0 2.4\nFile3 0 0.4 0 3.2\nTABLE I\nEXAMPLE OF RELEVANCE SCORE INDEX TABLE\nInner product Cosine similarity Euclidean distance\nFile1 1.20 0.13 4.80\nFile2 4.90 0.28 4.21\nFile3 3.60 0.24 5.20\nTABLE II\nRESULTS BY DIFFERENT MTHODS\nTable II is the results of different methods. The smaller\nresult of Euclidean distance is, the more relative we consider\nthe two vectors are. And it is opposite to measure the relativity\nby using “inner product similarity” and “cosine similarity”,\nthe larger score is then the more relative we consider they\nare. Through these results, we demonstrate the problems we\nmay confront using the Euclidean distance as the criterion of\nthe results. The vectors of File2 and File3 have the same\norientation, but the Euclidean distance between the search\nquery q is signi?cantly different. And the distance of File1\nfrom query is smaller than the distance of File3 from query,\nthis is unrealistic because a user always wants the server to\nreturn most relative results which will contain all the input\nkeywords respectively. Since the JL transform can only protect\nthe Euclidean distance, we are motivated to propose a novel\nmethod called “Optimized Maximum Query” to solve this\nchallenge.\nE. Optimized maximum query\nIn this subsection, we will discuss the method “Optimized\nMaximum Query” in detail. Speaking of information retrieval\nin the encrypted database, we have to take two factors \(security\nand ef?ciency We introduce JL transform\nto reduce the space consume and enhance the security of\nthe index but we also confront the challenge of making an\nef?cient trapdoor. In the subsection above, we have discussed\nthe shortcomings using the Euclidean distance directly. In\norder to meet the ef?ciency demand, we proposed Optimized\nMaximum Query” algorithm. The core of our algorithm is\nto increase the weight of the interesting words in the query\nvector. To help better understand the algorithm , we take an\nmathematical analysis based on a given example.\nGiven a simple search query q and a list of ?rst r interesting\nterms as {q1, q2...qr}. To enhance the weight of interesting\nterms in the search query, we expand the search query into\nm bit length vector by adding zeros behind and multiply the\nweight parament k to q. To guarantee the privacy and meet the\nsecure demand of trapdoor unlinkability , we will plus\na m bit random number vector ?. When compared with an\nindex vector p, we calculate the Euclidean distance to be the\nmatched scores as follows in Equ.5:\n324\nscore\(p, q p, k × q pi ? k × qi ? ?i pj ? k × qj ? ?j nm?\nt=r+1\n\(pt ? ?t p2j ? 2kpjqj ? 2pj?j + k2q2j + ?2j p2t ? 2pt?t 2t p2i + ?\n2\ni ? 2pi?i k2q2j ? 2kpjqj pi ? ?i nr?\nj=1\nk2q2j ? 2k × \(p · q q 5 send\nit to the cloud server to do a search, the score function can be\nmore simpli?ed as follows In Equ.6:\nscore\(p, q pi\n2 + ?2i p · q q  p · v p · q q q  p · q p · v p · \(kq + v 6 information retrieval, q and ? will change after we\ninput different interesting terms. But when we make one exact\nsearch, we can regard q and ? are constant variables. Therefore\nC is a constant positive number which is related to q and ?.\nAnd p · q is the inner production similarity. ?p?2 means the\nsize of the vector p and only depends on the construction of\ndocuments and keywords. Due to the score equation, to ?nd\nthe most matching documents is the same to ?nd the minimum\ndistance between search query vector and each entry vector in\nthe index.\nFrom the Equ. 6, we can conclude that the search accuracy\nwill be affected by ?p?2. So how to reduce the in?uence of\n?p?2 will become a huge challenge. According to the score\nfunction, when the weight parament k is large enough and the\nrandom vector ? is chosen well enough to make little affect on\nthe result we can eliminate the in?uence of ?p?2 on our ?nal\nFig. 2. original query distribution Fig. 3. trapdoor distribution\nresult. In our future study, we will quantity the result using\nmathematic methods. We assume that p is the plaintext query\nvector with m bits corresponding to one document, and i is\nthe encrypted index vector with b bits after the JL transform:\ni = p R, where R is n× b JL transform matrix. The trapdoor\nvector t is from t = \(q+v vectors, in\nour J-L scheme, from Equ.3 we can de?ne the ?nal JL scorejl\nfunction as below :\nscorejl\(i,t d\n2\(i,t pR, \(k × q p, k × q p, q 7 conclusion that with selectable\nparameters, our JL scheme results can get the ef?ciency\nas using the plaintext Euclidean distance search. And the\ndeviation between plaintext search and encrypted search comes\nfrom the 


parameters of the JL matrix R. Besides, we need\nless space and time consume than MRSE. We will show the\nexperiment results in the next section. More importantly, we\nwill talk about the security of the trapdoor Because we use\n“Optimized Maximum Query” to make a query, the word of\nthe interesting keywords will have large weight which will leak\nthe information of the query vector. In Fig2, the two interesting\nkeywords’ weight is much larger than other keywords which is\neasily attacked by an adversary. However, after the encryption,\nwe generate the trapdoor from the original query, obviously the\ndistribution of query is hidden through JL transform. In Fig.3,\nthe weights in the trapdoor are totally random, and the server\ncould infer little information from the random distribution.\nF. Ef?cient search algorithm\nAfter the analysis of our “Optimized Maximum Query”\nalgorithm to make a trapdoor, in this part, we will talk about\nhow to make an ef?cient search using our algorithm. The\nsearch algorithm can be described simply as follows: given\na m bit query vector Q ,we rst multiply a weight parameter\nk and then plus a random vector ? as Optimized Maximum\n325\nAlgorithm 2 Ef?cient Search\nInput:\nEncrypted secure index I;\nsearch query vector Q;\nthe random vector ?;\nProjection Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform matrix R;\nOutput:\nthe list of the ?les IDs from returning matching result n1: initialize ? = Ø;\n2: initialize trapdoor T = Ø;\n3: T = \(Q calculate the scorejl between Ii and T ;\n6: return the top-k minimum scores results ?;\nQuery says. Then we generate the trapdoor T by multiply\nit with the Projection Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform matrix\nR. At last we compare the Euclidean distance between each\nentry in the index I and return the top-k results with low\nscores. The detail of making ef?cient search is in Alg.2.\nGenerally, since the frequency in the trapdoor is hidden\nand isolated from the cloud server and JL transform is a one-\ndirection function, the cloud server cannot decrypt the trapdoor\nto obtain the original search query Q. Suppose even the user\ninput the same search query at different time, the distortion of\ndifferent random vector ? will have in?uence on generating\nthe trapdoor T , the cloud server will receive two different\ntrapdoors and never know the relationship between the two\ntrapdoors. By adopting these methods, we not only guarantee\nthe search accuracy but also live up to the privacy demand\nof “trapdoor unlikability”.As for “rank privacy”,our scheme\nwas unable to avoid the curious server to infer some rank\ninformation from the returned results like MRSE,as this is a\nnecessary privacy sacri?ce to get better user experiment.We\nnoticed that different b may provide different perturbation on\nthe ranked result,which will be digged in our future work.\nIV. RESULT AND COMPARISON\nIn this section, we would compare our purposed J-L scheme\nwith MRSE. We use precision rate and recall rate [21] as our\ncriterion to evaluate the search accuracy and compare search\nresults with standard results to calculate precision rate and\nrecall rate. Taking account of all former algorithms, to our\nbest knowledge and considering the fairness MRSE algorithm\nis the most representive one,since MKQE will face the space\nconsume problem as MRSE does. By the way, OPE method\nis not using the “vector space model” like MRSE and our J-L\nscheme. In a word, we demonstrate a thorough experimental\nevaluation on the TREC data [20], which is consisted of\n7594 documents and 18238 distinct terms. The experiment\nis implemented by MATLAB language and conducted on a\npersonal computer to imitate the cloud server with i-3 CORE\n2.13GHz processor and Window 7 home basic system. In the\nexperiment,we choose the weight parameter k = 1500,and the\nrandom ? is a uniform random distribution between {0,1}.\nFig. 4 the search ef?ciency with different b\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25\n0.35\n0.4\n0.45\n0.5\n0.55\n0.6\n0.65\n0.7\n0.75\n0.8\nrecall rate\npr\nec\nisi\non\n ra\nte\nPlain Retrieval\nProposed JL Scheme &b=1000\nProposed JL Scheme &b=4000\nKNN based MRSE\nFig. 5. the search ef?ciency of different algorithms\nThe parameter b represents the dimension of columns in the\nprojection JL transform matrix R, it is also the targeted\ndimension we will reduce the original index vector to. Fig.4\nshows different b will have different performance on the\nresearch result. As the b becomes larger, we will get the high\nperformance but the space consume will increase at the same\ntime.So choosing the selectable parameter k and b is feasible\naccording to the accuracy and ef?ciency need of the users.\nCompared with MRSE, we choose our b = 1000 and b =\n4000 where the original size is 18238, which means there are\n18238 different keywords in the dictionary. According to the\nresults shown in Fig.5, our scheme performs much better than\nMRSE when returning the top 10-30 results and the results will\nget much closer to the plaintext as we increase the parameter\nb. In the real-world circumstance, the user only concentrate\non the high ranked results,so our scheme can meet the user’s\nneed perfectly and be adopted into practical ways.\nFig.6 shows the space complexity of our algorithms with\ndifferent parameter b and the KNN-based MRSE. We conduct\nthe logarithmic coordinate systems to measure the size of s-\npace complexity. From Fig.6 we can see it is highly impressive\nthat our scheme consumes much less space complexity than\n326\n102 103 104\n10?1\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\nlog\(number of diocuments s\npa\nce\n si\nze\n nMB\n b=500\nFig. 6. the Space Complexity\nMRSE.

one of the most important contribution in this paper.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we ful?lled a system model to realize a\nmulti-keyword ranked search over the encrypted database\nin cloud computing. To meet the challenge of guaranteeing\nef?cient retrieval, we proposed our J-L scheme by applying\nthe Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform into this ?eld for the ?rst\ntime. And we proposed “Optimized Maximum Query” to make\nan ef?cient trapdoor Experiment results showed our novel\nscheme achieves advantages both in accuracy performance and\nstorage space.\nWe will provide strict mathematic analysis on the chosen\nrandom vector of our scheme in our future work on the\nresearch. Since the JL transform is the ?rst time introduced\ninto the ?eld of information retrieval over encrypted database,\nwe will do deeper research on this method and hope to expand\nthe application to other related signal processing ?elds like\nencrypted image search perfectly.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported in part by the Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China under Grant 61170234 and Grant\n60803155, by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the\nChinese Academy of Sciences under Grant XDA06030601,\nand by the Funding of Science and Technology on Information\nAssurance Laboratory under Grant KJ-13-02.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
