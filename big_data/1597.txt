A Deep Sum-Product Architecture for Robust Facial Attributes Analysis\nPing Luo1,3 Xiaogang Wang2 Xiaoou Tang1,3?\n1Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong\n2Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong\n3Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences\npluo.lhi@gmail.com xgwang@ee.cuhk.edu.hk xtang@ie.cuhk.edu.hk\nAbstract\nRecent works have shown that facial attributes are useful\nin a number of applications such as face recognition and\nretrieval. However estimating attributes in images with\nlarge variations remains a big challenge. This challenge\nis addressed in this paper. Unlike existing methods that\nassume the independence of attributes during their esti-\nmation, our approach captures the interdependencies of\nlocal regions for each attribute, as well as the high-order\ncorrelations between different attributes, which makes it\nmore robust to occlusions and misdetection of face regions.\nFirst, we have modeled region interdependencies with a\ndiscriminative decision tree, where each node consists of\na detector and a classi?er trained on a local region. The\ndetector allows us to locate the region, while the classi?er\ndetermines the presence or absence of an attribute. Sec-\nond correlations of attributes and attribute predictors are\nmodeled by organizing all of the decision trees into a large\nsum-product network \(SPN MPE on a large data set\nwith 22, 400 images show the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.\n1 Introduction\nVisual attributes are properties observable from images,\nsuch as “smiling” and “lighting”. They are powerful as\nhigh-level representations of images in a variety of tasks,\nsuch as object recognition image-to-text matching, and\nattribute discovery.\nThe usefulness of face attributes has also been demon-\nstrated in the applications of face search [11], ranking [19],\n?This work is supported by the General Research Fund sponsored by\nthe Research Grants Council of the Kong Kong SAR \(Project No. CUHK\n416312 and CUHK 416510 No.201001D0104648280 a of face variations. \(b  pre-\nde?ned functional regions, such as the eyes and chin shown in the second\nimage of \(a binary SVM to build a separate classi?er\nfor each attribute—this method is unreliable due to feature corruption at\nthe functional regions. \(c large occlusions. This study intends to bridge this\ngap between computer vision and human vision.\nand veri?cation [12]. The success of these algorithms relies\nheavily on the accuracy of predicted attribute values, i.e. the\nscores of separate attribute classi?ers. For example, Kumar\net al. [11] created an image retrieval system in which users\ncan search for face images based on text queries, such as\n“young woman smiling”. Images are retrieved by simply\nranking the values of face attributes. Recently, Siddiquie et\nal 19] exploited the cooccurrences of attributes to improve\nimage search performance. Since the query “young woman\nsmiling” contains the attribute “woman”, face images with\nattribute “mustache” will be disregarded, and those with\nattribute “blond hair” are likely to be selected.\nCurrent methods [11, 12] concatenate low-level features\nextracted from a few pre-de?ned functional regions, e.g.\neyes and chin, and then train a separate binary SVM\nclassi?er for each attribute. Although they are suf?cient\nfor well controlled environments, the problem is that if\nlarge face variations such as pose, lighting, and occlusion\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision\n1550-5499/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/ICCV.2013.356\n2864\nare present Fig.1 \(a func-\ntional regions as in Fig.1 \(b on top of them.\nIn uncontrolled scenarios, faces could be only partially\nvisible for many reasons. Subjects may intentionally wear\nmasks, sunglasses, or makeup to hide their identities. The\nsame happens when cameras cannot capture faces with the\noptimal viewpoints, subjects occlude each other, or some\nregions have heavy shadows under lighting conditions.\nEven if faces are fully visible, some functional regions\ncould be misdetected for various reasons. All the above\npose a big challenge for attribute estimation.\nNevertheless human vision can predict attributes even\nwith the presence of large variations. There are three key\nobservations. First, an attribute can be estimated even\nfrom small image regions. For instance, one can easily\npredict a person is “smiling” only by the mouth, as shown\nin Fig.1 \(c.1 occluded, an\nattribute can still be inferred by its interdependence with\nrespect to other regions. For example, according to the\neyes and the nose-mouth line \(c.2 smiling”. Third, the presence of some\nattributes may indicate the absence or presence of others.\nFor example given the “black hair” and “black eyes” of\nthe woman shown at the right, the attribute “European” is\nunlikely to be present.\nIn this work, we propose estimating attributes from\nface images that may be corrupted. Our method involves\nthe following three steps: 1 


attribute, 2 attributes.\nIn the ?rst step, we devise a discriminative binary\ndecision tree for each attribute. Each node corresponds\nto a rectangle region in images, and contains a region\ndetector as well as a regional classi?er The region detector\nprovides reliable localization over a cluttered background\nand occluded faces, while the regional classi?er predicts the\nattribute. Region discovery at each node can be considered\nas selecting the most discriminative region separating posi-\ntive and negative samples.\nIn the second step, a learned decision tree is transformed\nto a sum-product tree \(SPT regions. SPT outputs\nthe likelihood that an attribute will be present, using the\nscores of all the regional classi?ers as input. If a region\nis misdetected, the output of the corresponding regional\nclassi?er can be ef?ciently marginalized during inference\nwithout affecting attribute estimation.\nIn the third step, we organize all the SPTs into a sum-\nproduct network \(SPN organzine the regional classi?ers in a hierarchical\nmanner layers\nof sum and product nodes. As the SPN goes deeper, an\nexponentially large number of attribute correlations can be\ncompactly encoded. Even for a large and deep architecture,\nSPN can be ef?ciently learned by the EM algorithm, and\ncan perform exact inference, such as the most probable\nexplanation \(MPE misdetection handling is\nlike answering “probabilistic queries” [5]. We can ef?-\nciently derive the probabilities of the presences of attributes\nconditioned on only a few evidences, i.e. p\({presences of any\nsubset of attributes}|{scores of any subset of region classi?ers be summarized\nas follows. We propose a new deep SPN architecture for\nrobust estimation of facial attributes Our system models\nattribute correlations using a new network architecture\nthat combines decision trees with SPN, and has some\nattractive advantages. 1 discovered. 2 occlusions. The joint distribution\nof classi?cation scores and attribute labels can be learned\nfrom unoccluded training samples. 3 of attributes, which is not trivial \(there are 2n\npossible subsets for n attributes stage,\nany types of misdetections can be handled by ef?ciently\nmarginalizing the classi?cation scores of the misdetected\nregions.\n1.1. Related Work\nWe review several robust deep models to handle data\ncorruption, such as noise and occlusion. These models\ncan be divided into two categories: implicitly learning\nrobust features [22 4, 13], and explicitly modeling the\nstructure of occlusions [21, 20, 18, 16, 15, 14]. To learn\nrobust features, Vincent et al. [22] extended Hinton’s deep\nautoencoder [8] by randomly corrupting the input of the\nrestricted Boltzmann machine \(RBM explicitly\nmodel the structure of noisy images. Tang et al. [21]\nintroduced the robust Boltzmann machine which couples\nnoise estimation and feature learning. It distinguishes\ncorrupted and uncorrupted pixels and nds useful latent\nrepresentations. Nicolas et al. [18] proposed a more\nsophisticated model to separate appearance and occlusion\nboundaries of image patches with a ?eld of RBMs.\nThese methods have certain drawbacks. The denoising\nautoencoder [22, 4] has a strong assumption that input is\ncorrupted following a known distribution. The subsequent\nmethods [21, 20, 18, 16] overcame this problem by learning\nnoise models from training data. The learned models rely\non noisy training samples, but the large noise space cannot\nbe easily covered by the training set. We did not employ\n2865\nFigure 2. We ?rst select discriminative regions with a discriminative decision tree \(DDT a sum-product tree \(SPT c b the prior distribution\nof noise in face images and our training set does not include\nnoisy or occluded samples. Unlike previous deep models,\nour work does not need to employ or synthesis training\ndata with noise and can naturally cope with any kinds of\ncorruptions, because the scores of the misdetected region\nclassi?ers can be marginalized out.\nWe adopt the recently proposed SPN [17], which models\nprobability distribution by stacking many layers of sums\nand products. We extend the traditional SPN by proposing\na new architecture with 12 layers for modeling correlations\nof attributes. Our deep SPN learns the joint distribution\nof the regional classi?ers’ scores and the attributes’ labels\nfrom the images without occlusions, and it can capture\ncorrelations between any subset of attributes. During\ninference, occlusions can be handled by marginalizing out\nthe variables of the undetected regions given the property of\nSPN. Our SPN is more ef?cient and robust than the existing\nSPNs [17, 7], which use pixel values or low-level features\nas input, because we operate on classi?ers’ scores.\n2. Discriminative Region Discovery\nA binary discriminative decision tree \(DDT is learned\nfor each attribute to discover discriminative regions. As\nshown in Fig.2 \(a to a rectangle\nregion and contains a region detector and a regional classi-\n?er. Each node splits data into 


its children by ?rst scanning\nimages with the region detector and then classifying the\nattribute with the regional classi?er once the region has\nbeen located. The split process stops when a pre-de?ned\nmaximum depth is reached. In this work, the maximum\ndepth is 3 and the number of nodes is N = 7. Fig.3 shows\nthe selected discriminative regions of several attributes.\nIn order to learn DDT, three training sets are prepared:\n“presence”, “absence”, and “background”. Both the “p-\nresence” and “absence” sets contain images with faces,\nindicating whether the attribute is “on” or “off”. The\n“background” set contains images without faces. Training\nis conducted in four steps: 1 various positions; 2  positives, and the “absence” set\nas negatives; 3 information gain [1] as a discriminative region;\n4 selected\ndiscriminative region with linear-SVM, which utilizes both\nthe “presence” and “absence” sets as positive training\nsamples, and the “background” set as negative training\nsamples. Steps 1 to [25], and step 4 are captured in\nan unconstrained environment, the regions extracted from\ndifferent images at the same position are not well aligned.\nTherefore, given a sampled rectangle with its position\ndenoted as \(x, y region classi?er rc with\nlatent-SVM that iterates between locally searching the\nregion position \(x, y image and optimizing the\nparameters ? by minimizing the objective function,\nL 0 1? irc\(I\(x,y 1 x,y x, y and its label. rc\(I\(x,y x,y x,y x,y x,y I\(x,y determines the region position \(x, y current\nparameters ?. dist x, y x, y Eq.1 can be\nef?ciently optimized with the stochastic gradient descent\n[6].\n3. Region Interdependencies\nRegion interdependence is modeled with a sum-product\ntree \(SPT SPN Overview. SPN models joint probabilities and\nbuilds on the network polynomial [5], which is a multi-\nlinear function of variables’ indicators. For example,\nconsider the joint probability P \(A1, A2 binary\nvariables, A1, A2, which can be written as a multi-linear\nfunction with only sums/products: P \(A1, A2 P \(A1 =\n1, A2 = 1 A1 = 1 A2 = 1 A1 = 0, A2 = 1 A1 =\n0 A2 = 1 A1 = 1, A2 = 0 A1 1 A2 = 0 visualized in red. Yellow indicates the area where the seven regions\nare highly overlapped. Also, a positive example and a negative example are shown for each attribute.\nP \(A1 = 0, A2 = 0 A1 = 0 A2 = 0  is the\nindicator, i.e. 1\(x x simply by setting\nall the indicators related to A1 as 1 [17]. The above\npolynomial then becomes P \(A2 A2 1 A2 = 1 A2 = 0 A2 = 0 A1|A2 A1,A2 A2 variables, e.g. 2n for n binary variables.\nFigure 4. Example of SPN.\nSPN compactly represents the network polynomial in\na hierarchical manner. In the simple example shown in\nFig.4 \(a probability of two binary\nvariables, X1 and X2, as a rooted acyclic graph with\nterminal, sum, and product nodes. We denote indicators\n1\(Xi = 1 Xi = 0 The sum and product nodes are\narranged in alternating layers: all the children of a product\nnode are sums, and all the children of a sum node are\nproducts or terminals. An edge \(v+, v its child v? has weight wv+v? > 0, and all\nthe weights of its children\n?\n?v??Ch\(v v the set of children of v+. An edge \(v?, v v uniform weight wv?v+ = 1. With this representation,\nthe value of a sum node v+, denoted as Sv+ , can be\nrecursively derived as Sv+ =\n?\n?v??Ch\(v v root equals the joint probability of the variables [17],\ni.e. S\(X1, X1, X2, X2 X1, X2 a illustrates an example when X1 = 1 and X2\nis unobserved. Thus, by marginalizing X2, S\(1, 0, 1, 1 X1 = 1 0.3 × 0.4 + 0.7 × 0.7 = 0.61. With SPN, we can\nef?ciently infer the value of an unobserved variable using\nthe MPE inference [17], which has linear complexity in the\nnumber of nodes and is tractable in polynomial time. We\n?rst replace the sums with maximizations, as shown in Fig.4\n\(b product node with maximum\nvalue is selected during inference. The MPE contains two\npasses. The ?rst pass computes the value at each node\nfrom bottom to top \(b rst pass from top to bottom \(c 1, 1, the most probable explanation of X2 when\nX1 = 1 is 0. This is why we can estimate the occluded\nattributes conditioning on the observed ones.\nDDT to SPT. Our SPT considers the scores of 


the\nregional classi?ers {ri} in Eq.1 as terminals. To model\nregion interdependencies and simultaneously maintain the\ndiscriminative power of DDT, we transform a DDT to\nSPT, which can better handle misdetection. If a region\nis not detectable, DDT must guess the output of the\nregional classi?er at the misdetected node, while SPT can\nestimate the attribute by marginalizing the variables of the\nundetected regions.\nA decision tree can be transformed to a sum-product\nstructure with the join tree using the algorithm proposed\nin [10, 5]. A join tree is an undirected tree on which each\nnode is a set of variables, called a cluster, and each edge\nis labeled with the intersection of the adjacent clusters,\ncalled a separator. The join tree of our decision tree is\nillustrated in Fig.2 \(b instantiation\nof a cluster is mapped to a product node; and 2 a sum node.\n2867\nFor instance, as shown in Fig.2 \(b c blue r1r2, r1r2, r1r2, r1r2, and is\ntransformed to four products, while the separator r1 \(red instantiations r1, r1 is mapped to two sums. In\nFig.2 \(c instantiations\nwith sum/product nodes.\n4. Attribute Correlations with Deep SPN\n4.1. Our Architecture\nOur deep SPN jointly models the outputs of regional\nclassi?ers and the labels of attributes. It has two types of\nterminal nodes \(Fig.5 rij}K,Ni=1,j=1,\neach of which indicates the classi?cation score of the\nj-th regional classi?er of the i-th attribute. 2 Ai, Ai Ai = 1 and Ai = 0\ndenote that the i-th attribute is present; otherwise, Ai = 0\nand Ai = 1.\nIn the following we denote the name of an attribute\nwith bold Ai and its binary indicator with Ai, Ai. Our\nnetwork is shown in Fig.5, where different sets of nodes\n\(in dashed lines in bold type layer\n4 can be viewed as A1A2A3A4 for group A1A2A3A4\nin layer 5. A set of sum nodes represents the possible\ncorrelations among a group of attributes, e.g. there are 3\npossible correlations \(3 sum nodes A1A2A3A4 in\nlayer 5, each being the weighted sum of the product nodes\n\(instantiations the number of possible\ncorrelations, i.e. the number of sum nodes of each attribute\ngroup, is an empirical parameter. Once it has been set,\nthe number of product nodes for an attribute group is\ndetermined. In Fig.5 since both groups A1A2 and A3A4\nhave 3 sum nodes, there are 3 × 3 = 9 products in layer 4.\nIn our experiment we set the number of sum nodes in each\ngroup as a constant 20. Intuitively, a larger number of sums\nresult in larger number of products, which means they have\nstronger representative power.\nOur SPN is reconstructed as follows. 1 blue in Fig.5. 2 represent the correlations of the same set of\nattributes; 3 all\nthe products belonging to the same group of attributes, e.g.\neach sum of A1A2 in red connects to all the products in\ngreen, since they all relate to the correlations of attributes\nA1 and A2. A product node connects to two sum nodes to\nform the instantiations of an upper attribute group.\nInference. Given an image, we ?rst run the region\nFigure 5. In our SPN, different attribute correlations are modeled by different\ngroups of nodes, e.g. group A1A2A3A4 represents correlation among the ?rst\nfour attributes. When more layers are added an exponentially large number of\nattribute correlations can be compactly encoded. Ti represents a SPT and it has\nK × N terminals R = {rij}K,Ni=1,j=1.\ndetectors with the sliding window scheme. If a region is\nlocated apply the corresponding regional classi?er. Let\nRd, Rud, and A denote the continuous terminals i.e.\nclassi?cation scores of the detected and undetected regions,\nand the binary terminals respectively Inferring the values\nof attributes is equivalent to maximize the posterior with\nthe learned SPN,\n{A?,Rud argmaxA,RudP \(A,Rud|Rd A,Rud,Rd Rd 2 Rd are observed\nvariables.

Learning the Deep SPN\nThe learning algorithm is summarized in Alg.1. Given\na set of training images {Ii}ni=1, we ?rst obtain Rdi , Rudi ,\nand Ai from Ii. As occluded images are not required for\ntraining, Rudi could be empty. The training process iterates\nbetween learning weights w while keeping the network\narchitecture ?xed and pruning edges with zero weights.\nLearning weights w. If v?i ? Ch\(v is a child\n\(product v?i |Rd sum node v\n+, conditioned on\nthe observables Rd. SPN can be learned with an EM-like\nalgorithm following [5 The E-step computes P \(v?i |Rd to chose during inference. The M-\nstep adds all these probabilities and renormalizes them to\nupdate the 


weights. Speci?cally, at the E-step, we use the\nMPE inference as in Sec.4.1 to select the child of a sum\nnode At the M-step, we maintain a count for each of its\nchild, and increment the count if a child has been chosen in\nan iteration during training. Then the weights at each sum\n2868\nAlgorithm 1: Learning Deep SPN\nInput: All the training images {Ii} and the labels of 73 attributes\nOutput: w and network architecture\n1. train DDT for each attribute as described in Sec.2\n2. transform DDT to SPT by bi-breadth-?rst search in Sec.3\n3. obtain {Rdi Rudi ,Ai} from {Ii}, and initialize w and network\narchitecture as described in Sec.4.2\nrepeat\n-Update w\nE-step: infer Rudi ,Ai according to Eq.2, Sec.4.1\nM-step: renormalize w\n-Prune edges with zero weights\nuntil converge\nnode are updated by normalizing the counts over all of its\nchildren. A similar strategy was used in 17, 7].\nInitializing network architecture. We initialize the\nnetwork following Sec.4.1. Each group at an upper layer\nrepresents the combination of two groups at the lower layer.\nOur goal is to obtain a compact network structure, i.e. to\ndetermine which two groups should be combined, because\nthere are exponentially large numbers of combinations\nwhen SPN goes deeper. As we have 73 attributes in our\nexperiment, layer 3 in Fig.5 may contain 73!\(73?2 full combinations all the time, when more\nlayers are added, learning SPN becomes impractical due to\nhuge computational cost. For example, layer 5 will have\n2628!\n\(2628?2 compactness as well as combination diversity,\nwe introduce two constraints at layer 3 and the above layers:\n1 a group in the previous layer can be combined only once;\nand 2 priority\nto be combined. We adopt greedy search to ?nd group\ncombinations. Considering the groups at layer 3 of Fig.5\nin sequence, we ?rst search forA3A4 to be combined with\nA1A2, because they do not have overlap in attributes. We\nthen considerA1A2A3A4 as a new group at layer 5. And\nA1A2 can no longer be combined at the next iteration. This\nstrategy will reduce the number of groups at each layer\nby half at a time, while retaining the diversity of attribute\ncombinations. Our deep SPN has 12 layers in total.\n5. Experiments\nDatasets. The previous works [11, 12] evaluated their\nmethods on the subsets of FaceTracer and PubFig, but did\nnot release the subsets selected. Therefore, it is impossible\nto directly compare with their published results on those\ndatasets. To achieve a fair and extensive comparison, we\nconstruct a large dataset that is a composition of LFW [9],\nFaceTracer [11], and PubFig [12], and implement state-\nof-the-art methods for comparison. The face images are\ntaken in uncontrolled environments with large variations in\nFigure 6. Some images with occlusions in Experiment II.\nFigure 7.

An image was labeled by one sub-\nject because the data scale. Face images are roughly aligned\nbased on the positions of eyes, cropped and normalized to\n200× 160.\nI Learning Attribute Correlations. We use the learned\nSPN to compute the correlation between two attributes as\nthe conditional probability of one when the other is present\nin a way as described in Sec.3. Note that the correlation\nbetween any two sets of attributes can be computed in\nthe same way. The correlation value is in the range of\n[0, 1]. “0”, “0.5”, and “1” indicate “negative correlation”,\n“independence”, and “positive correlation”, respectively.\nFig.7 plots the pairwise correlations among 15 attributes,\nwhere an element in this matrix represents the probability\nof the attribute at the j-th column when the attribute\nat the i-th row is present. Some interesting results are\nobserved.

Classi?cation accuracies of deep SPN, SAC [12 11], and MAC [2]. The ?rst three rows are on the unoccluded test set, and the last three are on\nthe occluded test set.\nwith the separate attribute classi?ers \(SAC  MAC 2] on both the\nunoccluded and occluded testing images. The SAC trains a\nbinary SVM classi?er for each attribute. The original MAC\nis to predict human attribute based on poselets. We apply\nit to faces by replacing the poselets with our discriminative\nregions in Sec.2 and then train different level of classi?ers\nas in [2 Note that MAC can model pairwise attribute\ncorrelations.\nThe results are reported in Table 1. On the unoccluded\ntest, the averaged classi?cation accuracies of SAC, MAC,\nand deep SPN are 82.1%, 84.4%, and 87.9 respectively,\nwhile the corresponding accuracies on the occluded test set\nare 68.0%, 72.1%, and 79.8%. The deep SPN generally\nperforms better especially with the presence of occlusions,\nbecause it effectively models the high-order correlations\nbetween attributes and regional classi?ers. On the occluded\ntest set, the deep SPN signi?cantly outperforms SAC and\nMAC on nearly all the attributes, because SAC assumes\nindependence between attributes, while MAC can only\nmodel pairwise correlation. We also examine our SPTs\nalone. The averaged accuracies are 81.9% and 70.2%\nof the unoccluded and occluded tests, respectively, which\nindicate their performances can be signi?cantly improved\nwhen organizing them into the deep SPN. Moreover, it takes\n2 hours to train our deep SPN on two 3.3 GHz CPUs and\n16G RAMs, and 5.3 seconds to classify 73 attributes of an\nimage which is comparable to 5 seconds of MAC in the\nsame experimental environment.\nIII. Experiments on synthetic datasets. We evaluate\nthe robustness of deep SPN under different levels of\nocclusions on a synthetic dataset We use the same training\nand unoccluded test sets as in parts I and II. However,\nfor each sample in the test set, a series of corrupted\nimages are generated with the following strategy. We\n?rst generate random noise that covers the whole image,\nand then gradually reduce the coverage of noise towards\none of the four directions: “Top to Bottom”, “Bottom to\nTop”, “Left to Right”, and “Right to Left”. An example\nof generating occluded images along the “Right to Left”\ndirection is shown in Fig.8.\nFig.8 plots the classi?cation accuracies of the deep SPN\nwhen the percentage of visible image region is increased\nfrom 10% to 80%. At 50 visibility, all the accuracies are\nover 75% \(random guess is 50 few attributes need to be observed in\norder to infer the others. As plotted at the left of Fig.9, we\naverage the accuracies of the four directions and compare\nwith SAC and MAC. Our method clearly shows superior\nperformance, showing that our method is more robust when\nlarge occlusions are present.\n2870\nFigure 8 Classi?cation accuracies of deep SPN under different levels of\nocclusions.\nFigure 9. We compare our deep SPN with SAC [12] and MAC [2] under\ndifferent levels of occlusions.\n6. Conclusion\nThis paper has proposed a facial attribute estimation\nframework, where attribute estimation is achieved by\ncombining discriminative decision trees with a SPN. For\nrobust attribute estimation, we devise a deep architecture to\ncapture attribute correlations for the SPN, where occlusion\nhandling is casted as marginalizing the variables of the\nundetected regions. Experimental results on both occluded\nand unoccluded images show great improvement and indi-\ncate that our method is very robust under different levels of\nocclusions. As face attributes are becoming more important\nfor face recognition, in the future work, we will explore the\nadvantage to combine face attributes with traditional face\nrecognition approaches [23, 24, 3, 26].\nReferences\n[1] A.

between the MSL flight computer and the Electra-\nLite UHF Transceiver that resulted in constraints on nallowable command data product size and development of a \ncomplex buffer management system to avoid truncating \ndownlink frames.  While operational workarounds were \nultimately identified, these idiosyncrasies resulted in more \ncomplex ground processes and delayed other critical relay \ntests.  Future missions should ensure early and thorough \ndocumentation and validation of the end-to-end relay data \npath. \nVerification Validation \(V&V including during the cruise phase of the mission.  \nWhile these were addressed prior to arrival at Mars, and nactual surface operations have proceeded smoothly, it would \nhave been desirable to identify these issues earlier.  The \nchallenge here, which is common to the previous \nexperiences with MER and PHX, is that the testing timeline \nis dictated by the lander mission’s V&V test program and \ntestbed accessibility.  The Mars Exploration Program may \nneed to establish more formal guidelines for the scope and \nschedule of testing related to verification and validation of \nrelay services, and ensure that all missions develop their test nschedules and corresponding resource profiles to meet those \nguidelines. \nEnd-to-End Relay Testbeds:  The fidelity of the end-to-end \ntestbeds for relay system testing can play a significant role \nin the overall success of the V&V test campaign.  For the \nMSL-MRO link, both the orbiter and lander projects had \nhigh fidelity spacecraft testbeds resident at JPL, with \nEngineering Models of the Electra and Electra-Lite ntransceivers, and with flight-like representations of the \nspacecraft Command & Data Handling \(C&DH subsystem.  \nWhile these testbeds were located at separate sites within \nthe JPL campus, fiber optic links supported signal flow \nbetween them, as well as integration of a high-fidelity link \nchannel simulator capable of emulating realistic time \nvariation of link amplitude, frequency, and delay, enabling \nthorough end-to-end data flow testing over a range of flight-\nlike signal conditions.  For ODY and MEX, however, each \norbiter project had only a portable test set available at JPL to \nsupport cross-project testing with MSL, each with a flight-\nlike UHF transceiver but with lower fidelity representations \nof the orbiter C&DH.  This limited the scope of ground \ntesting possible on the MSL-ODY and MSL-MEX links.  \nThis, combined with some non-flight-like aspects of the \nODY test set that were discovered late in the V&V test \ncampaign, resulted in the deferral of full validation and use \nof the MSL-ODY forward link capability until well after \nlanding.  The conclusions here are that high-fidelity testbeds \nincrease the robustness of end-to-end relay testing; when \nprogrammatic considerations limit the test hardware fidelity, \nit is essential to clearly document and assess any non-flight-\nlike aspects of the testbed infrastructure. \nElectromagnetic Interference:  Uncertainty in the MRO nEMI environment resulted in significant concern prior to \nMSL arrival as to whether Curiosity would be able to \nachieve the desired 250 Mb/sol data return via the MRO \nrelay path.  This resulted in a large amount of MRO flight \nand ground testing to attempt to better quantify the EMI \nimpacts as a function of Electra return link frequency.  It \nalso drove the need for a lengthy commissioning phase \nduring the first few months of MSL surface operations, to \ncarefully monitor performance as each MRO science \ninstrument was powered on Electra’s frequency-agility \nturned out to be an important tool in mitigating the EMI \nimpacts.  In hindsight earlier and more thorough flight \ntesting could have provided more confidence in the \npredicted MRO relay performance; however, such testing \nwould have required interruption of ongoing MRO science \nobservations Ultimately, future missions will want to \naddress EMI issues earlier in the spacecraft/instrument \ndevelopment cycle to identify and mitigate any spurious \nemissions prior to launch. \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nNASA’s ODY and MRO orbiters and ESA’s MEX orbiter \nembody an international network of Mars relay orbiters, \nproviding essential telecommunication services to the Mars \nScience Laboratory mission.  All three orbiters provided ncomplementary coverage of MSL’s EDL, acquiring tracking \nand telemetry data from MSL’s UHF transmission that ncould have provided essential information for fault \nreconstruction had a mission-ending anomaly occurred nduring EDL.  Since landing, ODY and MRO are providing \nthe highest levels of data return yet achieved for a Mars \nlander, with over 45 Gb of Curiosity data returned over the \nfirst 90 sols of the surface mission.  Key to this level of \nperformance are a number of new capabilities in the Electra \nand Electra-Lite UHF Transceivers on MRO and MSL, \nrespectively, including higher data rates, frequency-agile \noperations, and adaptive data rates, as well as the dedication \nof the operations teams on each mission and the MaROS nmultimission relay operations tools and processes \nsupporting them. \n \n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 11 \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe research described in this paper was carried out at the \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of \nTechnology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration. \nREFERENCES  \n [1] Charles D.

the?Vdeorbit is computed based on a change of\nsemimajor axis from the current circular orbit to an elliptical\norbit that has the perigee at 0km and the apogee at the orbit\naltitude:\n?Vdeorbit,drag = ?V \(r, r RE , r, r 23 semimajor axis from the\ncurrent circular orbit to an elliptical orbit that has the same\nperigee and a slightly higher apogee:\n?Vdeorbit,SRP = ?V \(r, r, r, r + ?h, r 24 are due to the GEO restricted zone, the\n35km are to allow for gravitational perturbations, and the\nremaining margin depends on the magnitude of the effect of\nsolar radiation pressure on the spacecraft \(the larger the ef-\nfect, the larger the margin the spacecraft.\nOnce the ?V has been calculated, it is possible to compute\nthe propellant mass required to satisfy this ?V budget. The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators. The mass\nof the sensors is driven by the attitude knowledge accuracy\nrequirement acc \(Equation 26 satisfy by the momentum storage h required \(Equation 27 26 27 that acc can vary depending on the architecture, as the\npointing requirements of a high gain antenna, or an optical\npayload, are very different from those of a low gain antenna.\nConcerning the momentum storage h, it is assumed to be\nsized to counter the different disturbance torques produced by\natmospheric drag, gravity gradient, solar radiation pressure,\nor the Earth’s magnetic field. Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload. The\nconstans k that are used for each subsystem are summarized\nin Table 8.\nThe mass of the launch adapter mLA = 0.01mdry is added\nto the mass of the spacecraft.\nUpdate spacecraft mass and dimensions—After the first iter-\nation, the dry and wet mass of the spacecraft are updated.\nDimensions are estimated assuming a perfect cube of 100\nkg/m3. The mass and dimensions of the solar panels are\ntaken into account to update the inertial properties of the\nspacecraft, as illustrated in Equation 30:\nLA = 1.5s+ 0.5\n?\nAa\n2\nIz = 0.01mdry\nIx = Iy = Iz + L\n2\naMa \(30 design algorithm is\niterative because several feedback loops appear in the N2\nmatrix showing the dependences between different modules\nin the algorithm. For instance, the mass of the ADCS depends\non the mass of the spacecraft, which obviously depends on the\nmass of the ADCS. Thus, a set of convergence criteria need\nto be defined. The convergence criteria used by the tool are\ndescribed in Equation 31:\n|mdry,i+1 ?mdry,i| < 10kg 31 the current status of the MIT archi-\ntecture study for the SCaN system. The study consists of a\nstakeholder analysis to identify the primary stakeholders and\ntheir needs, and the development of a computational tool to\nexplore the architectural tradespace.\nSeveral interviews have been conducted with experts at\nNASA to elicit the potential requirements on SCaN from\ndifferent user communities.\nThe major architectural decisions to be made by the SCaN\nprogram have been identified and encoded in a mathematical\nmodel. A computational tool has been developed that can\nautomatically enumerate and evaluate thousands of different\nSCaN architectures. This tool contains both a performance\nand a cost model.\nNext Steps\nThe next steps include calibration of the optical link budget\ncalculations, comparisons of the network scheduling calcula-\ntions with historical TDRSS load data, and validation of the\nspacecraft sizing algorithm with real TDRS data. Following\nthe completion of the stakeholder analysis, the tool will be\nbe used to explore the architectural tradespace and identify\na subset of preferred architectures worth studying in more\ndetail. These architectures could then be analyzed in NASA’s\nArchitecture Development Lab \(ADL NNX11AR70G.\nThe authors would also like to thank the Centre de Formacio\nInterdisciplina`ria Superior and the Cellex Foundation for\npartially funding this project.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
