Educational \norganizations such as universities have a need to provide \neducational cloud curriculums for their students. In our \ncurrent research, we are constructing a private cloud based on \nsuper-saturation, which is defined as the allocation of a much \ngreater amount of logical resources than physical resources. \nSuper-saturated clouds therefore realize up to 10 times more \nrunning instances than conventional clouds. While the \nperformance of super-saturated clouds decreases somewhat \ncompared with conventional clouds, their costs also greatly \ndecrease. Moreover, in the post-cloud era, i.e., the big data era, \ndata scientists will be increasingly required to process big data \nin the cloud Mahout and Hadoop are two popular tools used in \nthe fields of data science and machine learning. However, a ncertain level of skill is required to build such machine learning \nsystems, and because it takes a long time to build such systems, \nthe curriculums available to learners are limited. In this paper, \nwe propose a method of rapid deployment for machine \nlearning systems in the educational cloud. We show that our \nproposed method can reduce the required preparation time. \nKeywords: Educational Cloud, Hadoop, Mahout \n \nI. INTRODUCTION nRecently, cloud computing has developed dramatically \n[1], and the development of mobile computing and IPv6 has \npromoted the growth of the Internet of Things \(IoT such as \nsmartphones and sensor devices are connected via the \nInternet. Furthermore, the big data generated by these \ndevices is collected in the cloud. The explosive growth of \nsuch big data is now a hot topic in business, and the field of \ndata science has developed in response to the need to apply \nsuch big data to business; hence, we are now in the cloud \nera.  \nIn the cloud era, conventional IT skills are not enough. \nFor example, embedded systems engineers must learn a \nnumber of Web services for calling cloud services from nembedded systems; cloud network administrators are \nrequired to manage more than 10-100 times more nodes nthan those found on a conventional network; IT architects \nare required to design cloud based systems; system nengineers must learn to ‘mash up’ multiple services for \nconstructing large systems in short amounts of time IT \nstrategists must collect business administrative data to be \nused for continuous cloud innovations finally, data \nscientists are required to identify useful business knowledge \nfrom collected data. \nAs for universities, while they are able to change \ncurriculums and educational environments for teaching \nadvanced ICT, in most cases students must still use shared \nPCs while simultaneously being limited from actually nimplementing and administrating their projects. \nWe propose an educational cloud as an educational nenvironment to support education in the cloud era. In our \neducational cloud, every student owns a dedicated PC. \nUsing this dedicated PC, the practices previously disabled \nby shared PC environments will become possible. For \nexample, administrator privileges are required in system \nadministration practices. In the educational cloud, students \ncan virtually own multiple PCs, thus allowing them to \nconduct various experiments by constructing a virtual \nnetwork using a set of virtual PCs. \nUsing conventional methods, the cost of constructing an \neducational cloud is high; therefore we propose a \n‘lightweight’ cloud to reduce the overall cost. To realize this \nlightweight cloud, we introduce the concept of super-\nsaturation. We define super-saturation as the allocation of \nmore logical resources than physical resources. For example, \nCPU resources are typically measured by the number of \ncores; a node is ‘super-saturated’ if the total number of nvirtual machine cores in the node is larger than the number \nof actual physical cores in the node. A typical educational \npractice is programming. In programming practice, many \nsmall programs often run over a short period of time. A \nsuper-saturated cloud is well-suited for executing many \nsmall programs. In other words, a super-saturated cloud may \nnot be well-suited for businesses because almost of the \navailable resources would be idle. It is possible to run 10 \ntimes the typical number of instances in a super-saturated \ncloud, and therefore the cost of such a cloud system would \nbe reduced to one-tenth of typical costs. \nRecently, big data has become a hot topic in the business \nworld, where massive volumes of a variety of data types are \ngenerated at high velocity. The main features of big data are \n2013 16th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems\n978-0-7695-5052-7/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/NBiS.2013.59\n372\ncommonly referred to as the ‘3Vs’ \(Volume, Variation, and \nVelocity predication, classification, and recommendation. \nHowever, big data itself does not result in meaningful nconclusions directly; data scientists who can analyze such \nbig data are necessary. Therefore, students learn data \nengineering or data science methods in schools. Big data, in \naddition to issues involving the processing of 3V data, may \nalso discover new values attached to the regularity of data. \nNetwork throughput is increasing, clouds are federating, and \nthe price of storage is decreasing, resulting in greater \ndemand 


for big data. To this end, therefore, more \neducational environments for big data experts are needed. In \nthe field of data science, machine learning is important. \nMachine learning is used for market predictions, the nanalyzing of popularity of goods, information extraction, \nand recognition in computer vision. Is these ways machine \nlearning is a powerful tool for data science. However, with \nconventional teaching methods, each student must build \ntheir own learning environment for machine learning; \nhowever, this need prevents students from adequately \nacquiring knowledge about machine learning. In this paper, \nwe propose a rapidly deployable machine learning \nenvironment, while demonstrating how to reduce the \nrequired deployment time.  \nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we \nintroduce several related works. In Section 3, we propose \nour rapid deployment method, and in Section 4 we evaluate \nit. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5. \n \nII RELATED WORKS \nRecently, big data has become a major topic in business \ncircles. According to Doug Laney, data growth challenges \nand opportunities can be described as being three-\ndimensional, i.e., increasing volume the amount of data the speed of data in and out the \nrange of data types and sources  at least 10TB, and often more than 1PB. For example, \nthere are many types of sensors in the real world. These nsensors generate a large amount of data in real-time. \nTherefore, big data is large, fast, and varied. In big data, \nalthough each set of data may be small, the total amount of \ncollected data is very large. From this new knowledge can \nbe discovered because of the data’s high resolution.  \nWe have looked at big data in our previous work [9]. We \nproposed a system that guarantees Web page existence. The \nInternet is usually used as a large database. However, Web \npages published by an author are often modified and deleted \nby the author but not by viewers. Therefore, it is difficult for \nviewers to guarantee the contents of the Web pages referred nto by official documents. Our proposed system checks \nwhether the contents of a page accessed at a single point in \ntime are the same. It does not need to collect all available \npages and can guarantee only those pages accessed at once. \nIn this system, the cache server log is constantly monitored \nand, cached pages are copied from the cache to an archive. \nFurthermore, a user can search pages by a query specified \nwith a particular time and retrieve the contents created or \nmodified at that time. \nAs mentioned above, sensor networks such as Home \nEnergy Management Systems \(HEMS of sensor networks, there are \nHEMSs as well as BEMSs \(Building Energy Management \nSystems power consumption data in homes \nand offices and then provide visualizations of the data for \nthe purpose of saving energy. For such purposes, sensors \nmeasure the parameters such as power consumption of \nvarious electronic products, room temperature, humidity, \nillumination, and human movement. Naturally, the amount \nof data gained in this process becomes large.   \nIn previous work [10] we propose cloud based HEMSs \nthat combine sensor networks with the cloud. In \nconventional HEMSs, an expensive home server is required \nto visualize the results of energy consumption analyses. In \nour method, however, the cloud costs can be reduced \nbecause a supersaturated cloud is more economical, as \nexplained previously. Our previous work also discusses \navoiding incidents for stable cloud operation.  \nTo discover new knowledge from big data, machine \nlearning is useful There have been many successful cases \nstudies on machine learning in big data. For example, the \nwebsite Amazon.com recommends books related to the ones \nthat customers have previously purchased or viewed. \nFacebook also recommends friends from the known data of \nits users. In addition, machine learning is used for spam nfilters in email systems. \nCurrently, many machine learning tools are available, \nsuch as Mahout and Jubatus Mahout [11] is machine \nlearning library derived from Hadoop, which is a Java-based \ndistributed processing system compatible with the Google \nMapReduce service. Therefore, Mahout is partially \ndependent on Hadoop Mahout supports various learning \nalgorithms, such as clustering, classification, and \nrecommendation. In clustering, Mahout creates groups of \ndata. In classification, it determines the categories of data. In nrecommendation, it identifies the favorite items of users. \nJubatus [12] is a machine learning system based on CEP \n\(Complex Event Processing stored data. However, it \nhas an advantage because it requires smaller resources to \nprocess big data than Mahout. Jubatus can also perform \nclustering, classification, and recommendation functions, \njust like Mahout Furthermore, the development of CEP-\nbased algorithms is planned for the future, indicating that \nJubatus will be able to be used for an even greater variety of \npurposes.  \nNext, we describe educational cloud [2][3][4 which we \nare developing as educational platform. This study is based \non the educational cloud. The most important feature of our \neducational cloud is supersaturation. Therefore, we call it \nsupersaturated cloud As mentioned in section 1, we define \nsupersaturation in the cloud as the allocation of more logical n373\nresources than actual physical resources. Supersaturation \ncauses to degrade the performance. Indeed, the performance \nof educational cloud is not so high. But, it is used for \neducation but not used for high 


performance computing. In \nthis study, we describe how to build educational \nenvironment of Mahout. However the aim is to learn \nMahout effectively but not to do high performance \ncomputing by Mahout.  \nUsing educational cloud, we have several educational \ncontents and services. Our educational cloud provides the nfollowing services. Basically, the educational cloud is \nIaaS.\(Infrastructure as a Service a \nbeginner who is more familiar with graphical user interfaces \n\(GUI CLI Thus we provide \nDesktop as a Service \(DaaS  and an instance through an \nSSH \(Secure Shell connecting SSH tunnels. We have \nbuilt Development as a Service \(DEVaaS  developing software on \nPaaS\(Platform as a Service students to start developing \nas soon as possible. We have developed PaaS on IaaS \(PoI  development of Web applications in \neducational cloud.  Furthermore, we have developed several \neducational contents and provide them as courseware on \nMoodle. The Moodle server is running on educational cloud \nand currently provides 48 courses in all categories. \n \nIII. EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT FOR MACHINE \nLEARNING nCompared with Mahout, Jubatus has a real-time \nadvantage because of its pipeline processing. That is, it can nbegin to process data before all of the data is collected. \nMahout is not capable of such pipeline processing. The \nresponse time for Mahout is longer than that of Jubatus \nbecause of batch processing However, Mahout has the \nadvantage of being able to combine with Hadoop. For \nexample, the Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS addition, Mahout can be combined with other \napplications such as Hbase and Hive. Because of Hadoop, \nMahout requires many system resources, but Jubatus can \nrun on small computers such as those in embedded systems nThus, each system has its respective advantages and \ndisadvantages.  \nIn this paper, we employ Mahout as a machine learning \ntool. We believe it is easier to learn Mahout than Jubatus, \nbecause generally speaking it is more difficult to understand \npipeline processing than batch processing. Furthermore, \nMahout can be programmed in Java.  \nWe have developed courseware for learning Mahout on \nMoodle, a learning management system. We employ \n“Mahout in Action” as the textbook. This text recommends \nJDK6, Maven 2.2, Hadoop 0.20.2 and Mahout 0.7. The \nstructure of this recommended environment is illustrated in \nFigure 2. Furthermore, the textbook introduces how to use \nIDEs \(Integrated Development Environments nFigure 2. Standalone environment for learning Mahout. \n \nNext we describe this recommended educational nenvironment for learning Mahout. The textbook requires the \nfour basic components illustrated in Figure 2 JDK, Maven, \nHadoop, and Mahout. JDK is used to compile sample \nprograms written in Java. Maven is used for project \nmanagement. Hadoop is used for running examples.  \nTo build such an environment, the following steps are \nnecessary.  \n1. Download and install JDK, and set the environment \nvariables;  \n2. Download and install Maven, and set the environment \nvariables; \n3. Download and install Hadoop, and set the environment nvariables; \n4. Set up JAVA_HOME in hadoop-env.sh;  \n5. Download and install Mahout, and set the environment nvariables; \n6. Enable access to localhost via SSH without a password.  \nTo build such an environment, Virtual Machine Monitor \n\(VMM students use a \nWindows PC environment. VMM is well-suited to run a \nguest OS Linux on host OS Windows environments.  \nThe abovementioned steps can take up to 90 minutes to \ncomplete. In addition, the image size of virtual machines \ntends to be large. A USB SSD is required to run VMM \nbecause USB memory is not suited for such purposes. Thus, \nthere are many issues that must be dealt with when \npreparing for learning. \nWe propose cloud based methods for the rapid \ndeployment of Mahout to reduce the time required for \npreparation. Using our educational cloud outlined in Section \n2, our proposed Mahout learning environment is illustrated \nin Figure 3.  \n \nPC \nEclipse \nLinux on VMM \nMahout \nHadoop \nMaven \nJDK \n374\n \nFigure 3. Cloud based environment for learning Mahout.  \nHere, we propose two methods for building \nenvironments: the stack method and the image method. In \nthe stack method, the environment is always built by \ninstalling a Mahout stack whenever an instance starts to run. \nThe stack consists of layers of applications. LAMP \(Linux, \nApache, MySQL, and PHP is a typical stack. In the image \nmethod, on the other hand, a Mahout stack has already been \ninstalled on the image. The image is specialized for learning \nMahout. However, the stack method provides more \nflexibility than the fixed image method.  \nIn our educational cloud, 30-100 instances can run on a \nsingle NC. Of course the larger the number of running \ninstances, the longer the time required to invoke instances. \nIn our experiments, the invoking time for about 60 instances \nwas less than 10 minutes. This time can be reduced by ncustomizing the image. In this sense, the image method is \nthe better way of building an environment nHowever, as mentioned above, the stack method has the \nadvantage of flexibility; it can be combined with other \nstacks. For example, if both Mahout and LAMP stacks are \ninstalled on the same instance, then the 


instance is useful for \nrunning Web applications using big data.  \n \nIV. EVALUATIONS  \nWe now evaluate the proposed method through \ncomparisons with other methods. In conventional methods, \nvirtual machines are usually used to run Hadoop in \nWindows PC environments. Virtual Machine Monitors \n\(VMM VirtualBox run a virtual \nmachine on Windows. In this evaluation, we employ \nVirtualBox as the VMM. \nThe specifications of our educational cloud are shown in \nTable 1. The NC of the OS is Ubuntu Desktop 11.10 n\(Gnome   1000\nInstance 1 0.5 6\n#cores: number of cores  \n \nTable 2 shows the specifications of a host machine \nrunning a virtual machine in the conventional way.  \n \nTable 2. Host machine specifications. \n PC \nCPU Atom N570 1.66GHz/2core \nMemory[GB] 1\nDisk[GB] 250\n \nIn Tables 3 and 4, the preparation times for several cases \nare shown. Here, we define preparation time as the interval \nfrom the time when a student wants to start learning to the \ntime when he or she really starts learning. Generally, the \nfirst preparation time is different from subsequent times \nbecause additional preparation is required for the first time. \nWe call this the initial preparation time.  \nFor the VMM method, the initial preparation time is very \nlong. Here, the initial preparation time does not include the \ntime required to download and install the VMM. For the \nstack method once a new instance starts running, it is \nnecessary to install Mahout. To this end, we developed an \ninstall script to install the stack easily. For the image method, \nsuch installation is not required. However, the Hadoop \nsystem must be re-configured because the IP address of the \ninstance changes at every boot time.  \n nTable 3. Comparison of initial preparation times. \nMethod Time[s] \nVMM 6116\nCreate VM 4539\nInstall 1577\nStack 303\nBoot 97\nInstall  206\nImage 136\nBoot 110\nConfiguration 26\n \nAs noted earlier, in the VMM method the initial npreparation time is longer than subsequent preparation times. \nThe preparation times for the other two ways on the other \nhand, are equivalent. However, for the VMM method, after \nthe initial preparation times subsequent preparation is not \nneeded except for the copying of the installed image. The \nimage size of the VM in our study was 2.37GB.  \n \nTable 4. Comparison of preparation times across methods. \nMethod Time[s] \nVMM 242\nStack 303\nImage 136\n \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper we proposed a cloud-based method for the \nrapid deployment of machine learning tools for the purpose \nof building educational machine learning environments As \nshown in Table 2, the total time required to download all of \nthe components, including JDK, Maven Hadoop, and \nPC \nSSH SSH\nInstance \nMahout \nHadoop \nMaven \nJDK \nEclipse SVN\n375\nMaven, was 207[s] using the VMM method. If we subtract \nthis time from the total time of 6116[s], the result is 5909[s], \nwhich is longer than the allotted class time of 90 minutes. \nTherefore, even if not all of the necessary components need \nto be downloaded, the VMM method is not a practical \nmethod to be employed in 90-minute classroom \nenvironments. In addition, if the installation happens to fail \nfor any reason, it is necessary to rebuild the VMM from the nfirst step described above. On the other hand, when cloud-\nbased methods are used, there is no need to ever rebuild an \neducational environment. These results suggest that the \nproposed method can reduce preparation time to as little as \n1/20 of the conventional preparation time. Furthermore, we \ndeveloped a configuration script to reconfigure the Hadoop \nsystem using the image method. Using this script, we can \nreduce the configuration time from 74[s] to 26[s].  \nIn our future work, we plan to add support for other \nmachine learning tools, such as Hbase, Hive, and Jubatus. \nThen, we will extend our basic system to one that focuses on \nbig data as a service.   \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] P.

In particular the pads staggering and\ndisplacement is faithfully reproduced.\n• Magnetic ?eld and multiple scattering: an angle distributed\nwith a Gaussian distribution with ??, ?? = 5, 20mrad\nis conservatively assumed.\n• Incoherent Background: the ? - dependent incoherent rate\nis from Fig. 4, scaled to L = 5× 1034 cm?2s?1.\n• Coherent Background: the ‘standard’ coherent background\nremains to be simulated.\n• Cathode charge distribution: a Gaussian distribution with\n? = 3mm is assumed. The charge is spread in two\ndimensions over the neighbouring pads.\n• Ef?ciency: an ef?ciency of 1 for a charge deposit above\n0.5mip is assumed. For a deposit below 0.2mip the\nef?ciency is null, and increases linearly between these\ntwo values.\nIt should be noted that each of the above features with its\nparameters can be switched on or off and parameterized.

READ-OUT SYSTEM AND DATA-QUALITY\nMONITORING\nThe off-detector readout chain of the ATLAS detec-\ntors presently consists of sub-detector speci?c ReadOut\nDrivers\(RODs ROS ReadOut Links \(ROLs  the S-link protocol [7]. The ROLs cross the boundary\nbetween the sub-detector domains and the TDAQ domain.\nAfter Long Shutdown 3 this organisation will be changed: the\nworking group for de?ning the architecture of the off-detector\nreadout has recommended to split the ROD functionality in\ntwo:\n• The front-end links connecting the detectors to the off-\nchamber readout electronics will be interfaced to a general\npurpose COTS network with a stateless, non-detector-\nspeci?c and high-availability interface.\n• The ROD data processing and other functions will operate\non data delivered by an industry standard network Even-\ntually such a ROD could be implemented in an industry\nstandard PC.\nThe front-end links will be for many subdetectors by CERN\nGBT links [8], which also can, and will, be used for transferring\nTTC, DCS, and front-end con?guration information. In view\nof the handling of DCS traf?c, the interface should be as\nstateless and as ignorant of detector speci?cs as possible, that\nis, its state should not depend on the state of the DAQ system\nand subdetector-speci?c data handling should be avoided. The\ninterface must also be able to generate a BUSY signal when\nits event data buffers become full and to connect to both the\ncurrent and the upgraded Phase-II TTC system.\nThe connectivity of the interface, which is named FELIX\n\(Front End LInk eXchange implemented with FPGAs\nfor interfacing to the GBT links and for formation of data\nstreams that will be routed to server PCs. For event data, these\nPCs will perform the classic ROD functions: fragment building\nand associated error detection, data checking and transformation\nand monitoring. The fragments may be forwarded to server PCs\nimplementing the ROS functionality or alternatively the ROS\nfunctionality can also be implemented in the same server PCs\nas used for fragment building. DCS and front-end con?guration\ninteract with the on-chamber systems via the general purpose\nnetwork and FELIX.\nTwo important advantages of the architecture are: minimiza-\ntion of the amount of special purpose detector-speci?c hardware\nand associated ?rmware and the exibility offered by the use of\ngeneral purpose, industry standard networking and server PCs.\nOn the time scale of installation 40 or 100Gb/s Ethernet \(and\nsimilar speeds for In?niband available\nat reasonable cost, so that the data from 10 to 25 fully utilized\nGBT links can be concentrated on a single network link \(even\nhigher concentration is possible when, as for the NSW, the\nGBT bandwidth is not be fully utilized functionality as needed.\nIf needed, the processing capabilities of these PCs could be\naugmented by GPUs or other types of coprocessors such as the\nIntel Xeon Phi coprocessor [9]. The use of PC technology and\nCOTS network \(for the output to the ROS as well bene?ting\nfrom further evolution of the technology. Testbeam work and\nproduction testing will be possible with less performant network\nand server PC hardware than needed for the ?nal system, but\nthe network protocols and the software can be identical to\nthose to be used in the ?nal system.\nBy adopting FELIX as the NSW off-detector readout, the\nNSW will be Phase-II compatible with respect to functionality4.\nThere are two possible models for FELIX: \(1 to GBT links and one network card, or \(2 system is by means of mezzanines that can be replaced for\nthe Phase-II TTC system. Although the former is less compact,\nits network connection does not require ?rmware development,\nit is more ?exible and is more easily upgradeable. The FPGA\nboards maybe commercial boards or boards developed for other\nprojects such as the ATCA based TELL40 for the LHCb Phase 1\nDAQ upgrade [10], the ALICE C-RORC PCIe board [11], to\nbe used as the new ROBIN [12] for Phase 0 ATLAS DAQ and\nthe GLIB board [13] developed by the CERN GBT project.\nFor initial testing of the FELIX approach in 2013 / 2014, the\nserver PC-plus-PCIe plugin card model will be taken Either\nthe C-RORC, the GLIB board if its PCIe interface can be\nused, or a commercial FPGA PCIe card will be used. NSW\ncollaborators will be part of a wider collaboration designing\nand building the FELIX interface.\nIX CONCLUSION\nThe proposed NSW will allow the ATLAS muon system\nto maintain its full trigger acceptance and its excellent muon\ntracking at the highest LHC luminosities expected. At the same\ntime the Level-1 single muon typically pT > 20GeV requirement for very good segment angle resolution\nof 1mrad at the Level-1 trigger level. This angular 


resolution\nallows for a powerful background rejection in the track density\nNSW environment. It is also an important step towards a further\nimprovement of the muon Level-1 trigger system foreseen in\nthe Phase-II upgrade for even higher luminosity. This Phase-\nII upgrade will substantially improve the pT resolution of\nthe Level-1 muon system. This will be achieved by using\nthe information of precision tracking detector Monitored\nDrift Tubes, MDT per track segment\nprovided by the NSW.\n4Full Phase-II compatibility requires the hardware to be performant enough\nand to support interfacing to a new TTC system.\nThe NSW project consists of R&D of detector technology\nand electronics. The schedule for installation is 2018 at LS2.\nBefore the installation, it is planned that the completed wheels\nare fully tested on surface during 2017 for about one year. In\norder to match such a schedule, the production of the chamber\nmultiplets, which is expected to take < 2 years to complete,\nshould start from 2015. Year 2014 will be devoted to the\nproduction of module-0 and its quali?cation.\nREFERENCES\n[1] ATLAS Collaboration, The ATLAS Experiment at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider JINST 3 \(2008  Experiment, Tech.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
