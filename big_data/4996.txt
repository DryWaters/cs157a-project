227 Finding frequent patterns in data mining plays a significant role for finding the relational patterns. In this study an extendable and improved itemset generation approach has been constructed and developed for mining the relationships of the symptoms and disorders in the medical databases. The algorithm of the developed software finds the frequent illnesses and generates association rules using Apriori algorithm. The developed software can be usable for large medical and health databases for constructing association rules for disorders frequently seen in the patient and determining the correlation of 
the health disorders and symptoms observed simultaneosly Keywords: Improved itemset generation approach, Data Mining Artificial Intelligence I  I NTRODUCTION   The usage of data mining and artificial intelligence techniques in the medical areas and knowledge discovery is very significant for searching the hidden and valuable data Data mining explores the hidden relationships and secret knowledge that can not be observed and evaluated by the human beings easily and improves the quality of our lifes by helping the experts showing the secret relationships and 
correlations in the large databases [1; 2   Data mining has been played an important role in the intelligent medical systems [3; 4  T h e relatio n s h i p s o f d i so rders and the real causes of the disorders and the effects of symptoms that are spontaneously seen in patients can be evaluated by the users via the constructed software easily Large databases can be applied as the input data to the software by using the extendibility of the software. The effects of relationships that have not been evaluated adequately have been explored and the relationships of hidden knowledge laid among the large medical databases have been searched in this study by means of finding frequent items using candidate 
generation. The sets of sicknesses simultaneously seen in the medical databases can be reduced by using candidate generation of Apriori algorithm Apriori is a data mining algorithm for mining frequent itemsets for association rules [5; 6  T h e n a m e o f t h e al g o rith m  is based on the fact that the algorithm uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties. Apriori algorithm uses an iterative algorithm known as a level-wise database search for finding frequent patterns  II  THE  GENERAL  STRUCTURE  OF  THE 
 DEVELOPED  SYSTEM  In this study an improved itemset generation algorithm approach is developed for mining the relationships of the symptoms observed together. The developed algorithm shows the relationships of the symptoms observed together by generating the itemsets and constructing association rules using the candidate generation algorithm.  In the developed approach the algorithm can be stopped by the user according to the itemset number \(generation\ determined by the user in addition to the classical type Apriori itemset generation approaches. The 
developed approach can finalize itemset generation process before reaching the last itemset, this approach gives the opportunity to construct different association rules according to the user defined itemset number parameter. The constructed system also includes the classical properties of Apriori algorithm. The pruning property is used in the software for optimizing the constructed software and decreasing computation time The constructed approach also explores dependencies of the illnesses and symptoms frequently observed in the medical data bases.The developed software was constructed by using C#.net 
programming language and the joining step and the pruning step properties of Apriori algorithm were used. The pruning step property of Apriori algorithm is added to the software for scanning large medical databases more effectively and quickly In the developed approach, the itemset generation process can be stopped by the user according to the itemset number generation\ determined by the user in addition to the classical type apriori itemset generation approaches. This proposed 


approach gives opportunity to the system for generating different association rules regarding to the generated final itemset. In the classical approaches the algorithm continues itemset generation process until finding the last itemset. The developed software also supports the classical itemset and association rules generation properties in addition to the approach expressed above The software is developed with the specification of adaptation to large and different databases. The number of the transactions can be extendable by the specialists or the user and the support count values can be changed by the user of the constructed software. The self pruning property is used for improving the performance of the developed software. Each transaction represents different kinds of disorders observed synchronously in the patients in the medical database. Support counts can be changed for determining the frequency of the illnesses in the medical databases The sets of frequent itemsets \(illnesses, symptoms and disorders itemsets\ are generated by scanning all the transactions in the medical database regarding the minimum support threshold level via developed software. The minimum threshold support level can be determined by the user, or the specialists using the software. The minimum confidence value is determined by the user for constructing \223strong association rules\224 for the symptoms observed in the patients and researching the dependency of them. The confidence value is a user defined parameter which is proportional to the set of illnesses spontaneously observed in medical transaction databases and this value is determined by the user of the software for obtaining the dominant correlations among the disorders seen in the related patients The general structure of the developed software depends on the finding frequent itemsets using candidate generation Apriori\ algorithm. The input data can be read from the text file and can be extendable for large data bases [5  T h e support count can be also determined as different values for having the feasibility to be adaptable to different data bases. In the Apriori algorithm, initially the set of itemsets including one item is constructed and the medical data base is scanned for determining the count for each item. The support count expresses the number of minimum count and expresses the count of repetition number of the selected item or subset used for constructing larger sets. Joining the sets with k elements will give us the sets with k 1 elements by obeying the joining and minimum support count threshold property of Apriori algorithm. Collecting items that satisfy the minimum support count are expressed by the set named L n The itemset generation algorithm recursively iterates until finding the last itemset The self pruning property is used for optimizing the software for scanning large medical databases more quickly All nonempty subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent according to the pruning property of Apriori itemset generation algorithm. The pruning property searches for the subsets of any of the candidates that have a subset which is not frequent. The pruning step of Apriori algorithm enables the algorithm to run faster when large databases are scanned. All subsets of a frequent set must also be frequent according to the pruning step property. The pruning step property can be summarized as Any itemset that includes k-1 elements which is not frequent can not be a subset of a frequent k itemset. This property decreases the computation time when very large databases are used. By using this property, some itemsets can be pruned by not scanning all the transactions of the input database. The pruning property is also used in the constructed software for increasing the performance of the algorithm and also decreasing the computation time [6-9   The input database is a medical database that shows the symptoms and disorders or sicknesses observed.  The medical data base consists of 25 transactions. Minimum support count can be changed by the expert and different association rules can be generated depending on the support count threshold level. The relationships of the diseases observed can be easily interpreted by the experts via the constructed software. The database can be read from an extendable text file and the number of transactions is unlimited and can be specified by user Transactions of the input database represent the gastroenterological disorders or the disorders or the symptoms simultaneously observed in patients of the medical database A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 and A 5 represent the disorders named as Gastric Ulcer, Duedenal Ulcer, Reflux Disease, Dyspepsia and Stomach Cancer respectively in the input database and each transaction T 1 T n row\presents the specified patient and each column represents a disorder or symptoms mentioned above. The 1\222s in the table depict that A n  disease or symptom is observed in the patient T n and the zeros \(0\epict that the specified disease is negative or not observed in patient T n   Some of the transactions were shown in the Table 2.1                 Table 2.1 Some of the transactions of the input medical database showing the diseases and symptoms Finding frequent itemsets using an iterative level-wise approach based on candidate generation is known as Apriori algorithm and the steps of classical Apriori algorithm is given as below  T A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5 T 1 1 1 0 0 1 T 2 0 1 0 1 0 T 3 0 1 1 0 0 T 4 1 1 0 1 0 T 5 1 0 1 0 0 T 6 0 1 1 0 0 T 7 1 0 1 0 0 T 8 1 1 1 0 1 T 9 1 1 1 0 0 T 10 0 0 0 1 1 T 11 1 1 1 1 0 T 12 1 0 1 0 0

Some diseases or symptoms may be the cause of some other types of diseases or the symptoms The constructed software has a very significant role for determining the associations of the diseases by constructing association rules  002 212 212 212 003  004  004  004 1 11 21 12 1 2 1 2 11 1 min_sup   _ 1  1  1    2   2       2   2    2  1    kk k k k count return L L procedure apriori gen L frequent k itemsets for each itemset l L for each itemset l L if l l l l l k l k lk lk then cl l 212 212 212 005 006 212\212 004 004 007 007\007\212=\212 007\212<\212 b 2 1 1   __      _   1  1 k k k k join step generate candidates if has infrequent subset c L then delete c prune step else add c to C return C procedure has infrequent_subset c candidate k itemset L frequent k itemsets for each k 212 212 212 212\212 212 1    k subset s of c if s L then return TRUE return FALSE 212 t    II.I  G ENERATING A SSOCIATION R ULES B Y C ANDIDATE G ENERATION   For the test procedure the minimum support count was determined as 4. In the last set combination, itemsets are the itemsets that include 3 items as shown in the Fig. 2.1 In the Fig. 2.1, the calculated results are shown when the support count was specified as 4. In the Fig. 2.2 the results are shown when the minimum support count threshold level was determined as 5  When the support count was determined as 4 the last itemset combinations are shown as below  A 1 A 2 A 5..............with Support Count 4 A 1 A 2 A 4............. with Support Count 4 A 1 A 2 A 3.............. with Support Count 7  A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 and A 5 represents the disorders named as Gastric Ulcer, Duedenal Ulcer, Reflux Disease, Dyspepsia and Stomach Cancer respectively.  In the last itemset combination the support count value was calculated as 4 for the combinations of the symptoms or disorders  \223 A 1 A 2 and A 5\224 and \223 A 1 A 2 and A 4\224 respectively. For \223 A 2 A 2 and A 3\224 combination, the support count was calculated as 7. \223 A 1 A 2 A 3\224 combination with Support Count 7 represents strong relationships or triggering effects among the diseases and symptoms named as A 1 A 2 and A 3 respectively. And the correlation and triggering effect of this combination was found stronger than the other combinations The association rules are constructed by using the resultant sets generated finally. When minimum support count was determined as 5, \223 A 1 A 2 A 3\224 combination with support count 7 was derived as the final combination set \(Fig. 2.2\. After finding the last table of frequent itemsets, rules are generated according to the frequent ite msets by considering the minimum confidence threshold level. The minimum confidence threshold level is expressed in the equation 2.1 Confidence  A B 006 B to Support Count of A.  In test procedure in the Figure 2.1 the developed software calculates the last table of frequent itemsets as A 1 A 2 A 5 A 1 A 2 A 5\ and A 1 A 2 A 3\sc\224 represents the support count of the algorithm     s cA B Confidence A B P B A sc A n is the ratio of Support Count of \(A 


 Fig.2.1 The results calculated when the support count is determined as 4   Fig. 2.2 The results are shown when support count threshold level is determined as 5  Some of the association rules constructed from the last itemset are given as below  A 1 A 2 n A 3 has the the confidence value of 7/13 0.538=%53.8  A 2 A 3 n A 1 has the the confidence value of 7/9= %77,7  A 1 A 3 n A 2 has the the confidence value of 7/12= %58,3  If the confidence level is specified as %50 these rules are accepted as a strong rules and depicts the ratio of occurrence of illnesses of A 1 A 2 A 3 to A 1 and A 2 observed spontaneously on the patients In addition to the classical approaches, the constructed approach can calculate the association rules from the desired itemset number and this specification gives the system the opportunity to generate different association rules. When the set generation part of the algorithm is finalized according to the itemset number 2, some of the constructed association rules are  A 1 n A 2 has the confidence value of 13/18 =0,722=%72,2 A 1 n A 4 has the confidence value of  5/18 = 0,277=%27,7 A 5 n A 2 has the confidence value of  5/8 = 0,625  A 2 n A 4  has the confidence value of 6/17= %35,29 III  R ESULTS AND F UTURE W ORK   Satisfactory results were obtained for determining the correlation among the symptoms and diseases observed in the test procedure of the system. The developed system has the capability for generating rules from the desired itemsets and this property gives the system flexibility for generating more classification rules. In addition, the developed system has also the capability of generating rules from the last itemset. The developed software will help to search correlations among the symptoms in the large databases and triggering effects of each symptom. This study constructs association rules via the last itemset generated and the desired itemset The developed software generates association rules for determining the relationships among the diseases observed synchronously. The generated association rules are too significant for making early diagnosis for the correlated diseases. This study shows the correlation of some types of gastroentrological diseases as gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer and stomach cancer etc. Some types of diseases can have triggering effects on different kinds of diseases. The gastroenterelogical symptoms and diseases which have stronger effect on each other can be determined and interpreted by the constructed system and the large and extended databases can be scanned effectively with the pruning property of the developed system  R EFERENCES   1   A  S a dan a n d a m  M.

analysis and forecasting To establish the data mining database To analyze the data To establish the model  To evaluate and validate the model To implement the model To revise the model 823 of the bank, a large number of customers may have very high similarity in depositing, loaning or utilizing other financial services. In this way, it forms the customer groups owning commonness.  Through the classification analysis, we can find out their commonness, provide them targeted services, and thus to guide their investment behaviors and to enhance the bank's comprehensive service level, as well as to achieve more benefits. Customer classification can also be carried out on the customers' consuming behavior analysis. It will be more customized to mine the post-classification data; in this way, the enterprise can offer different product contents for the customers with different behavior patterns B.   The customers acquisition and maintaining analysis The growth and development of the enterprise need to maintain old customers and to acquire new customers constantly. New customers include the people who had never heard of our enterprise products previously; the people who did not need our products before ; as well as the people who had been the customers of our competitors previously. No matter which kind of customers the enterprise requires, data mining can help it to identify these potential customer groups increase the response rate of market activities and finally to enable the enterprise to know exactly what to do and shoot the arrow at the target.  Since the enterprise doesnt know much about the information of new customers, it should take some necessary means to obtain information on potential customers The information should include the address, age, income range occupation, educational level and buying habits.  After acquiring the related information, by observing the potential customers reaction to its   products, the enterprise can establish the data-mining predictive models according to 


feedback, and find the products in what the customers show the most interest. The mining results will show a list of potential customers; at the same time, it can analyze which kind of people most likely potential customers is, according to the analysis of potential customer information. After getting these outcomes, the enterprise will have the leading direction when it is searching for the potential customers Customer retention is a process to keep old customers and to prevent them from losing.  In this process, we should first analyze the data of the customers whom we have lost, to find the behavior patterns of these customers, and to analyze the reasons for losing customers. Based on the characteristics of these losing customers, the enterprise should promptly adjust service strategies towards them, and act appropriately to retain customers according to the characteristics of customers which are got from classifying the customers. Customer retention is an extremely important part in the customer relationship management C.   The analysis of customer loyalty The analysis of customer loyalty mainly analyzes the customer durability, immobility and stability. The durability of customers reflects customers continuous consumption in the enterprise. Then, the immobility of customers reflects the degree that the customers are affected by various factors Moreover, what the customers stability reflects is the customers consumption cycle and frequency. The customer who purchases products of the enterprise at short intervals,    is considered as being stable.  For example, by carrying out data mining to the customers VIP card information, we can record the customers ' buying sequence and group the goods that a customer has purchased at different times and in different marketing activities into sequences. The data mining of sequential patterns can be used to analyze customers purchasing trends and thus to distinguish the customers loyalty. At the same time, it can predict changes of customers loyalty. According to all of these, the enterprise can adjust and update the price, the types of goods, as well as their marketing strategies to retain the existing customers and attract new customers. The analysis of customers durability, immobility and stability mainly take advantage of the trend analysis approach in the time series models.  Trend analysis consists of the analysis about several aspects, like trending, cycle trend 


and changes, seasonal trend and changes, irregular random trend.  According to the trend analysis, the enterprise can understand customers consumption trends over past a period Combining the analysis results and predicting results of data we can estimate a customer's durability, immobility and stability, and then determine the customers loyalty D.   The Cross-Selling Analysis Cross selling refers to the process that the enterprise sells the new products or services to the existing customers. The advantage of cross selling is that, for the existing customers the enterprise can easily get relatively abundant information about them, which contributes to the accuracy of data mining However, in most cases, the referred cross-selling is different from the initial sale. In the customer information which is hold by the enterprise, particularly in the information of previous purchasing behaviors, it may include the key factor or even the determining factor that will decide this customer next purchasing behavior : that is, it can help the enterprise to find these factors which will affect customers buying behaviors E.  The customer profitability analysis The customer profitability is an indicator for the quantitative evaluation of customer value.  It is a process that based on the prescriptive evaluation scale, it gets a definitive result through calculating the customer data. Therefore, the calculation of customer profitability does not need data mining However, by utilizing the data mining technology, the enterprise can predict the changes of customer profitability in different market competition environment and market activity environment.  The customer profitability analysis is intended to find those "high-value customers, and to proceed deeper and more detailed customer relationship management towards them.  In the analysis of customer profitability, the data mining application is aimed at finding out the most suitable market environment, so that the enterprise   customer profitability can be optimal CONCLUSION In the information age, the enterprise should make full use of its information resources, and change the product-centric management model into the customer-centric management model. Moreover, it also should focus on the collection of customer information; establish the customer-data warehouse utilize the data mining technology and analyze features of 


customers to provide the enterprise with decision-making 824 supports in the marketing, production and operations, and to improve the corporate performance continuously REFERENCES 1]   Zhu Ming, Data Mining.

Also, there is a strong dependency between mothers being smoking or not during pregnancy and the mental health of her kids.  By going through most of the generated rules, we could find that the results are consistent with the latest medical research findings. In addition to that we have found that some of the rules are completely nontrivial, such as that rule that states that there is  a relationship between not having dogs or cats in household and the effect on the kid  being shy when meeting friends VI. CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have discussed the problem of the high volume of medical data to be read by physicians, the accuracy rate that tends to decrease, and automatic reading of data that becomes highly desirable. Various association mining techniques have been considered.  Of those techniques, we have chosen AprioriTid algorithm as the basic association mining technique. It is been implemented as the core of our medical mining system. The system has been implemented and used against the data of the National Center for Health Statistics \(NCHS Prevention \(CDC disseminated and analyzed on the health status of U.S citizens. The outcomes of collection and analyses are made available through different data release mechanisms including

In our experimental phase, we have used a minimum support value of 1%, and minimum confidence equals to 70%. From the generated association rules that we have found some interesting rules that can be used in the early prediction of health problems ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors wish to thank the research center in the college of computer and information science, King Saud University for funding this work REFERENCES 1] N.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
