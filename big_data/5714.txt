Association rules relating food tastes and Kikei roles based on Yakuzen theory Linfu Li Muroran Instititute of Technology 27-1,Mizumoto-Cho Muroran, Hokkaido, 050-0075,Japan e-mail li@mmm.muroran-it.ac.jp Takeshi Uozumi Muroran Instititute of Technology 27-1,Mizumoto-Cho Muroran, Hokkaido, 050-0075,Japan e-mail:uozumii@epsilon2.csse.muroran-it.ac.jp Abstract  Yakuzen theory is still regarded as a hypothesis. Many aspects of herbal treatmentsê effectiveness remain to be clarified Nevertheless, research results show that many rules have been advanced for foodsê associated medical roles. Kikei, one promising hypothesis, holds that food taste will play a special medicinal role in different organs. This study, using data mining techniques particularly addresses the relation between the food taste and Kikei 
role to extract the associated rules. Results of cluster analysis and chi-square tests show a therapeutic effect, which encourages our establishment of a systematic methodology related to food taste Keywords-Kikei, Yakuzen association rule,cluster,support I I NTRODUCTION Particularly in recent years, as lifestyle diseases have increased, health-conscious nutrition is recognized as important. Consciousness of food care and food support without nutritional guidance from a dietitian is growing in popularity. One method is Ya kuzen food theory [1  a Chinese food medical theory based on èfood as medicine Based on theories of traditional Chinese food medicine Yakuzen has affected dietary treatment over Chinaês long culinary history. However, many such hypotheses of food 
dietary treatment remain to be verified. This study uses data mining techniques particularly addressing the relation between food taste and its Kikei role [2   a C h i n e s e medicinal conceptÖÖto extract rules associating foods with their physiological effects. Using cluster analysis [3 d ch isquare tests, we verified therapeutic effects to support our eventual aim of establishing a systematic methodology of food theory II YAKUZEN THEORY Yakuzen theory, originally fro m China, was translated into Japanese directly based on the theories of Chinese medicine ingredients. It is a food-based health care method based on food characteristics and a personês health status Normal foods that have medicinal roles can be regarded as 
Yakuzen food The importance for food, regarded as a medicinal material, is related to whether the food itself has the role of heating or cooling the body The roles which elicit body heat or cold, designated as the five characters \(translated from Chinese into Japanese as Goki arm, hot, neutral, cool, and cold. According to the natural level of cooling, the food characters are separable into cool and cold types; by the warming level foods are classifiable into warm and hot types. Being neither warm nor cold implies a neutral character. For example, after eating ginger or hot pepper, a personês body will feel hot and perspiration is likely to appear. Warming foods are of two types: hot and warm, which make the body work 
actively, improve blood flow, and remove cold from the body to warm the body. Cooling character foods are of two typesÖÖcool and coldÖÖwhich reduce body heat, hydrate the body, and eliminate poisons from the body. Neutral foods can balance body heat, making the body neither warm nor cool Another aspect of food is taste. According to Yakuzen theory, foods have five tastes, translated from Chinese into Japanese as Gomi They are sweet, sour, bitter, hot, and salty Each taste has distinctive physiological effects. For example bitterness can discharge extra components from the body; its drying role can discharge heat and water from the body which is helpful for high fever and constipation. Sourness can produce muscle tightening, having the function of 
stopping perspiration or heavy urination. Therefore, sourness is effective for hyperhidrosis, urinary frequency, and involuntary ejac ulation. Tastes have effective roles for human organs, named Kikei, which means that the food can be located selectively at one organ and can affect the organ In a body, there is a meridian system. The meridian system is a transmission course of energy and information. The meridian system reaches each internal organ. For a medicine or a food, Kikei means which meridian in particular internal organ it can reach and be effective Table 1 presents the Kikei relation between tastes and affected organs TABLE 1.

III ASSOCIATION RULE Association rules are popularly researched methods of data mining for discovering interesting relations among elements in large databases. Piatetsky-Shapiro [4 d e s c ri bes  analyses and precedent strong rules discovered in the database. Based on the concept of strong rules association rules are used for discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by supermarket POS systems. The rule onions, potatoes}=>{ground beef found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, the customer is likely to also buy ground beef. Such information is useful as a basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements. Here, the association rule will be used to verify the association between the Kikei character of Yakuzen to human organs To select the association rules, constraints on various measures of significance and interest are useful. The bestknown constraints are minimum thresholds of support confidence, and lift The support supp\(X\ of an item set X is defined as the proportion of transactions in the dataset which contain the item set. The confidence of a rule is conf\(X=>Y\=supp\(X 004 Y\/supp\(X For example, {Ginger}=>{Lung} has a confidence of 0.2/0.4=0.5 in the database, whic h means that it is applicable for 50% of the transactions under the condition. The lift of a rule is defined as lift\(X=>Y\pp\(X 004 Y\/supp\(Y\supp\(X The rule appearance ratio is low if the support is lower However, if the items are in numerous databases, then a high support degree of individual items cannot be expected. Rule evaluation must be considered comprehensively for support confidence, and lift IV EXTRACTION OF ASSOCIATION RULES FOR THE FOOD TASTE AND KIKEI ROLE The study aims to clarify the association rules for food taste and Kikei medicinal effects. In the study, another taste faintê, was regarded as important too, and will be regarded as the other five tastes.  From the reference of çChinese food treatment  138 food var i e tie s ar e s e lec t ed fi r th e food taste.

Before calculation, the data of Table 2 are translated into a database format as in Table 3, in a transaction, 1 represents presence, and 0 denotes the absence of an item. The item frequency is depicted in Fig 1 Fig 1.

V A NALYSIS OF THE EXTRACTED ASSOCIATION RULES RELATED TO FOOD TASTE AND THE K IKEI ROLE As a criterion of associated rules, only support and confidence evaluation are not always appropriate. To evaluate the extracted association rules properly, chi-square tests were performed in addition to the support and confidence The proposed associated rule is X=>Y. The support of X Y, and X 000 Y is marked as S X S Y and S XY The amount of transaction is proposed as M. In addition, the chi-square test 6 v a l u e of T dep is calculated using formula \(5 T dep M\(Sxy-Sx 2 1-Sy 5 If T dep is small approaching 0, then the X and Y relation is independent. If T dep is larger, then X and Y show a strong correlation Propose an established level of significance, if T dep  002 2  001  then X and Y are inferred to be independent.

We verified the Kikei role of Yakuzen using data mining. The association rule between food taste and the Kikei role was extracted based on the support and confidence. A stronger association rule is shown between sweet and spleen, and sweet and stomach. The association rules are verified using the chi-square test. Aside from hot with lung, other association rules between tastes and organs show significance. This time, only 138 samples were used perhaps explaining the lack of an association between hot and the lungs The next step of research will involve collecting more food samples to verify the association rule R EFERENCES 1 T atsum i H   Y ak uz e n m a te r i al d i c t i o nar y G e nso u S y a, p p  1 5 2 7  2006 2 S e o  K Mur a k a t a, A an d I n ata E.

TEST AND CON CLUSION 


Take a industrial boiler as an example, there are 52 attributes in the process history database. In the test we will take 10 attribute which are stand for temperature of main vapor, pressure of main vapor, water level, steam drum pressure, steam drum temperature, etc. The fault is category attribute, A-heating pipe blasting, B-priming, C excessive pressure, D-Iess water in boiler, E-more filled water in boiler.

Interval partition by competitive agglomeration algorithm We will use competitive agglomeration algorithm to divide the quantity attribute in the industrial boiler history database. First discretize the quantitative attributes into several optimize intervals, take the main vapor pressure as an example, collect all the data to form a data set X, apply the competitive agglomeration algorithm to cluster X, then we can get partition matrix U and the center of classes vi the row element of U is the degree of membership of the element in X. according to the maximum degree of membership principle, the element in X will be clustered into c classes, take the minimum element as the left end point and the maximum element as the right end point, in this way, the quantitative attributes are discretized into c optimize partitions. Inlikemanner we can discretize the other 9 quantitative attributes, the number of optimize partition are 5 ,  4 ,  4 ,5 ,5 ,6,4 ,5 ,4 respectively.

Analysis of experiment Result From Table 3 ,  we can conclude: most of the rules mined by fuzzy association rules algorithm can reflect the relevance between the attributes and faults in the industrial boiler system. The result of experiment shows that the algorithm is of high preciseness for mining rules 67 IV. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY In this paper, competitive agglomeration and fuzzy association rules are applied in fault diagnosis at the same time, the result with the requirements for diagnosis correctness. In the future, considering to add scale center in the situation that has plenty of data, and higher dimensions are also will be researched; in this way can we improve the performance of fault diagnosis REFERENCES I] Ashok Savasere, Edward Omiecinski, and Shamkant Navathe.

In order to notice the differences, all grayed cells are pruned thanks to the RSA education wage [6;7] [8;9] [10;13] [14;18 2.85; 4.70] 3 4 15 -22 4.75; 7.14] 1 3 8 -12 7.30; 12.67] -2 -3 1 5 13.00; 26.29] -1 -4 -25 30 TABLE VII ENHANCED CONTINGENCY TABLE OF VARIATIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATION \(EDUCATION-WAGE This table is the starting point of the consolidation process described below 39 


V. CONSOLIDATION PROCESS The first step to build the largest zones is to scan the enhanced contingency table of variations looking for the cell with the highest absolute value This cell constitutes the first rectangle noted R1 with the coordinates of upper left point pl and lower right point pr The second scan compares all the values in the immediate neighborhood of R1. The expansion is performed in descending fashion, i.e. starting from the largest value with similar behavior of the constituted rectangle expanded to the new coordinates The expansion of the formed rectangle continues by performing the summation of its vicinity cells values. We start by including cells whose values sum is the largest. The expansion stops once meeting null cells and the consolidation process ends when all maximal rectangles are formed. These results allow restricting the number of records to be processed by only keeping those retained after the consolidation phase When applying this process to the enhanced contingency table of variations resulting from the education-wage only would be considered the records included in the clusters "education=[10;13]" or "education=[14;18]" associated to "wage=[2.85;4.70]" or wage=[13;26.29 Notice, in the case of the association education ? wage process enables to focus on 172 records instead of 526 \(32 VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we describe our discretization approach focusing on the potential interactions between a databases variables. This approach makes it possible to carry out a contextual discretization maximizing the informativeness and highlighting the variables dependencies The use of a tabular representation is particularly interesting in the case of numeric variables
