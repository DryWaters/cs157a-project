A MULTI-MECHANISM RULE-EXTRACTION PIPELINE FOR USE ON UNANNOTATED DATASETS Alwyn Goh  Hoe Kok Meng School of Computer Sciences Universiti Sains Malaysia 1 1800 Penang Malaysia E-mail alwyn@cs.usm.my Abstract We outline a hybrid methodology incorporating both supervised and unsupervised-learning components-for rule-based knowledge discovery from unannotated data ie when the classification information is unknown The motivation for our work stems from the individual effectiveness of 
various data mining mechanisms ie 1 class identification via unsupervised datavector cluster formation 2 datavector simplification and feature selection via attribute discretisation and 3\symbolic rule extraction via the association of symbolic rules with the structural parameters of a trained neural network NN The basic operational concept involves the pipelined application of various unsupervised and supervised mechanisms ie 1 k-means 2 Chi-2 3 local cluster LC network training and 4 
rule extraction from a trained LC network The featured methodology will be tested and analysed using several well-known datasets Keywords Rule extraction, clustering, discretisation supervised learning, unsupervised learning 1 INTRODUCTION Knowledge representation in the form of symbolic rulesets are appealing in a data mining context primarily due to their simplicity and unambiguity, and has long been central to research in artificial intelligence AI and knowledge engineering The formulation of such conceptually clean descriptions from real-life data is however, complicated by the almost inevitable occurrence 
of data heterogeneity and incompleteness respectively resulting from datavectors being composed from combinations of symbolic, discrete and continuous-valued attributes and datasets including noise statistically anomalous values and missing attributes In addition classification information pertaining to individual datavectors is often unavailable-or at best available only in some imprecise rule-of-rhumb form-in most data mining applications The research described in this paper is motivated by the necessity to address such fundamental realities hence the proposed combinative application of various supervised 
and unsupervised learning mechanisms so as to enable rule-based knowledge extraction under some fairly generic application scenarios The presented rule extraction framework is a hybridised multi-stage application of clustering feature selectioddiscretisation and NN based rule extraction mechanisms as will be outlined individually and in coordination with one another 11 OVERVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF DATA ANALYTIC MECHANISMS EMPLOYED 2.1 An K-Means Datavector Clustering unannotated dataset is simply 
an undifferentiated collection of multi-component datavectors S  xi  i E l n  for which the classification attribute c\(xi for a E I k with k  n presumed is unknown Note the intentional suppression of the vector component index, which will be dealt with in the following section on feature discretisation Our methodology assumes the possibility of deducing the value of classification attribute from information intrinsic within the datavector 
itself which is usually a reasonable assumption for most datasets with ordinal or continuous-valued components A dataset satisfying this presumption can be represented by k datavector clusters with cluster membership in our case being determined via the k-means clustering algorithm. This well-known algorithm allows for the division of the dataset into cluster-sets ie S  US with each distinct cluster Sa  xla c\(xi a  a i E

Dataset clustering via k-means is initiated via the random assignment of all datavectors to the presumed set of constituent clusters after which the cluster-specific attributes py 0 61 are computed Each subsequent computational round would then reassign the a cluster membership for each xi E S such that Ixf\224\222  pj is minimised for the fresh a value A set-wide error E=C/Xra is also computed after each round I which can be regarded as the merit criteria associated with the cluster representation of the dataset The k-means clustering process is then usually continued until cluster membership stabilises or the global error drops below some specified threshold The popularity of k-means in data mining applications is due in large part to the basic procedural simplicity which frequently lends itself to many variations ie tree-like hierarchical clustering as suggested by 4 The set-cluster representation is, on the other hand, non-deterministic \(due to the random initial membership and dependant on k ie the externally specified cluster multiplicity There are two diametrically opposed strategies to deal with this issue ie Over-estimation in the initial k value followed by progressive amalgamation of clusters thereby resulting in a reduced k with closely-separated centres as defined by the comparison of lpa-pJ with a 6 values for both clusters Under-estimation in the initial k value followed by progressive partitioning of loose clusters thereby resulting in an increased k as defined by large 0 6 values both of which in common to basic k-means would also require multiple iterations to select the best cluster representation ie that resulting in the lowest global error It should however, be pointed out that cluster multiplicity can often be deduced for many data mining problems as would justifiably be the case for both featured datasets ie the widely analysed Breast-Cancer and Irises which respectively have two benign and malignant and three known Iris sub-species\classification values 2.2 Chi-2 Attribute Discretisation Discretisation of ordinal or continuous-valued datavector components is motivated by the desirability of a discrete valued or binarised input attribute representation for the subsequent rule-extraction phase Attribute discretisation procedures can be characterised as being supervised or unsupervised-respectively applied on datavectors for which the classification attribute is known and unknown the former of which ye considered to be far more compute efficient The featured Liu-Setiono 2 Chi-2 algorithm assumes the successful computation of c\(ZIa\222  a via the k-means algorithm following which supervised attribute discretisation can be executed on each component of multidimensional datavector Zfa\222     xy a Chi-2 is also considered to be a dynamic refinement of its static predecessor Chi-merge formulated by Kerber which generates a discretised attribute representation from the progressive pairwise merging of adjacent attribute-value intervals with the lowest significance level as indicated by a ay\222 and ej a nj ni,i+i respectively denoting the actual ni,i+i measured and expected frequency of a-classified datavectors in the j-th attribute interval The expectation value e would in turn be established from J Total datavector frequency in the j-th interval nj  Cay\222 Paired-interval datavector frequency for a-classified datavectors nfJ:l  ay\222 Total paired-interv\222al datavector frequency ni,i+i  C nj  C n:;il a i+l J=I i+l j=i Interval pairing via Chi-merge would commence from an initial association of intervals with individual datavector attribute-values, and would continue until all paired-interval x\221 values exceed an externally specified significance level Discretisation down to a single interval encompassing all attribute-values\frequently occurs for at least some of the datavector components, the occurrence of which indicates the insignificance of that particular component for classification purposes Each classification significant component would subsequently be representable via discretised vector Zi a d\(Xi e with d\(Xi  pj   the set of interval-specific values as represented by the mean of all resultant i-th component values within the j-th interval i Chi-2 essentially entails iterated executions of Chi-merge with a dynamic global significance level so as hold set-wide classification inconsistency-arising om the indistinguishable discretisations d\($\224\222  d of datavectors with unequal classification values a  p below an externally specified limit Attribute discretisation would also occur in two phases featuring 1-383 


1 Multi-component attribute discretisation up to maximum vector-wide x2 value maximum component-specific x values 2 Individual component attribute discretisation up to 2 both of which are required to comply with a prespecified inconsistency limit In 7 and 8 Chi-2 discretisation has been applied in mining rules from NN and rough sets-based methods Note discretisation results in both dimensional via identification of classification-insignificant components\and numerical due to d\(zi  d\(f2 for i f j dataset reduction. This effect would be significant for many data mining applications as demonstrated for the featured Breast-Cancer and Irises datasets Chi-2 execution in these cases results in a 15-25  dimensional and 50-65  numerical reduction both of which would simplify the subsequent rule-extraction process J 2.3 Local Cluster Training and Rule Extraction A generalised symbolic description of an annotated dataset can be obtained from a variety of supervised NN training and rule extraction methodologies as systematically classified by the Andrews-Diederich-Tickle ADT taxonomy 9 The proposed framework features the Rulex procedure formulated by Andrews-Geva AG 3 for symbolic rule extraction on LC networks which feature localised Radial Basis Function RBF like activation functions constructed using sigmoidal building blocks The basic attraction of the featured methodology stems from the relatively fast-compared to the more widely used Multi Layer Perceptron MLP networks with globalised sigmoidal activation-LC parametric convergence during training and also the natural manner in which rules are computed from trained LC network parameters The latter is in notable contrast to the majority of NN-based rule extraction frameworks with distinct rule extraction processes executed after satisfactory completion of NN training The featured NNs are composed of sigmoid pairs pi x  l+e-ki\(xi-ci+bi  l+e-kiGi-ci-bi restricted to a single dimension in a multi-dimensional datavector Z    xi I with i used as the component dimension \(as opposed datavector index Note the localised functionality ie pi xi E 0 far away-as defined by the exponential suppression ki from the interval ci  bi ci  bi with centre C and breadth bi  These unidimensional pairs are subsequently combined by a sigmoidally-activated output node of form g  l+e-K TPi\(Xi  with each individual pi retroactively interpretable as a hidden node\localised in the i-th component but contributing a non-localised ridge-like projection in the other datavectors components   xj   with j  i The x parameter is intended to cancel-out all such ridges resulting from cp thereby resulting in the sigmoidal superposition being localised near multi-dimensional interval E  6 E  61  Output node activation would therefore only occur in that interval with x being dependant on datavector dimensionality and K determining the abruptness of the activation interval Restricted LC training would entail the progressive reestimation of free parameters E 6 E so as to maximise gradient descent with respect a set-wide error of form E=Z q f2\(j J  with j the hitherto suppressed datavector index and a some extemally specified in our case via datavector clustering classification value I j I It The AG-proposed Rulex 3 formalism utilises the localised activation of the q node in terms of constituent pi nodes such that class membership is established for datavectors in x f2 with f2 the lower and upper activation thresholds This is interpretable in terms of rules of form if xi E xi x then a  l with threshold values xi  ci k ry intended as a more precise definition of the neighbourhood around classification centre C  Symbolic rule formulation would therefore require the straightforward usage of the post-training ci  bi  ki to neighbourhood radius equation I with m  min{pi xi the minimum activation value associated with the i-th hidden node This value can in turn be straightforwardly established via the relation   with max{pi xi pi ci K a fixed output node parameter and T an externally specified output activation threshold 1-384

Table 1 Dataset Characteristics We are currently evaluating the effectiveness of the presented framework on other larger and more complex datasets and hope to report the results thereof in a subsequent publication 4 CONCLUDING REMARKS The provided classification information is required for an evaluation of the k-means process which is approximately 90-95  accurate for both datasets Following this the Chi-2 procesmxecuted with a 1  inconsistency threshold-is observed to have the following effects \(Table 2 on the respective datasets The discretised datavectors and the cluster-assigned classification attributes are then divided into training and test datasets, the former of which is used to generate the trained LC network required for symbolic rule extraction Subsequent execution of the Rulex process would result in 2 symbolic rules for Breast-Cancer and 5 for Irises after straightforward elimination of redundant repeated or irrelevant inapplicable with respect test dataset rules The classification performance of these rulesets when applied to the test datasets is indicated below Note the attainment of 85 YO and 70  classification accuracy for Breast-Cancer and Irises respectively the former of which is probably operationally acceptable It should, however, be pointed out that two of the three Irises classifications-ie the versicolour and virginica sub species respectively class values 1 and 2 in Table 3 below-are relatively difficult to distinguish from each other but straightforwardly distinguished from the setosa sub-species class 0 as reported in an earlier publication  101 featuring analysis using Kohonen Self-Organising Maps SOM We also noticed a disproportionately significant reduction in setosa and virginica datavectors after attribute discretisation, which is also noteworthy due to the resultant accuracy of setosa classification If we are allowed to take this dataset-specific oddity into account then the test classification accuracy is an exemplary 100  Tnhle 2224 Test Classification The proposed sequential application of classification via datavector clustering feature selection and data simplification via discretisation and lastly knowledge extraction via NN training and symbolic rule generation appears to be a kndamentally sound methodology for the analysis of unannotated datavectors with ordinal or continuous-valued attributes Such attribute values would be a natural consequence of instrumentalised data collection and as such would constitute an important subclass of data mining applications A truly generic data mining fiamework should, however, be able to handle both categorical and ordinallcontinuous attributes on an equivalent basis and we anticipate this being an interesting line of research to undertake 5 REFERENCES  11 Lton Bottou and Yoshua Bengio, \223Convergence Properties of the K-Means Algorithms\224, Proc of 7 Conf on Neural Information Processing Systems Denver USA 1994 2 Huan Liu and Rudy Setiono, \223Chi2: Feature Selection and Discretization of Numeric Attributes\224 Proc 7th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence Washington D.C 1995 3 Robert Andrews and Shlomo Geva, \223Rule Extraction from Local Cluster Neural Nets\224, submitted to Neurocomputing, February, 2000 4 Tian Zhang Raghu Ramakrishnan and Miron Livny 223BIRCH: An Efficient Data Clustering Method For Large Databases\224 Proc of 1996 ACM-SIGMOD Int Conf on Management of Data, Montreal, Quebec 1996 5 James Dougherty Ron Kohavi and Mehran Sahami 223Supervised and Unsupervised Discretization of Continuous Features\224, Proc.
