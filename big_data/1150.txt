Word of Mouth and Critical Reviews for the Motion Picture Industry in South Korea: On Mainstream and Non-mainstream movies   Joonhyuk Yang GSCT, KAIST joonhyukyang@gmail.com   Luke Kim GSCT, KAIST doiluvu@gmail.com   Naveen Amblee GSCT, KAIST amblee@kaist.ac.kr   Wonjoon Kim GSCT, KAIST wonjoon.kim@kaist.ac.kr   Abstract The purpose of this study is to figure out how WOM 
and critical reviews impact weekly box office revenues and how the impact is different on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The data of this study is from the motion picture industry of South Korea. 118 movies data was collected and movies were categorized into two groups by their distributors. The results show that the volume of WOM was positively significant to box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. The number and attitude of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue, but the number of critical reviews was statically significant to the aggregate box office revenue. The effects of WOM were not statistically different between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The effects of critical reviews, however, were 
different between mainstream and non-mainstream movies   1. Introduction  Word of mouth \(WOM\ one of the most ancient information channels in human society ong information channels, WOM is perceived as more credible and accessible than other information channels, such as advertisemen A ddition a ll y   the growths of online communities and portals, which are based on the Internet, have provided new channels for WOM. The advantage of the Internet as an information channel is that the amount and characteristics of information can be easily measured 
This feature of online WOM provides opportunities for the measurement of WOM, and there have been many studies related to WOM that have taken advantage of data collection on the Internet [4-9  In particular, WOM is an important information channel for consumers to observe characteristics and quality of experience goods in advance of consumption. Motion picture is a good example of experience goods, and the amount of academic studies related to the motion picture industry is rising sharply  T w o m a j o r reas on s support t h i s ph e n o m e n on   First, the motion picture industry has economical 
importance. It is reported that spending only on theatrical tickets was about $9 billion in the United States in d 3 bi llion  w i t h both  th eatrica l  and ancillary markets in South Korea in 2004 [12  Second, the industry provides rich data for the entire product life cycle and as such appeals to researchers There have been studies relate to motion picture industry and WOM [13, an d WOM i s u s u a l l y  perceived as an important factor in moviegoers  selection [18Critical reviews are also important attributes of box office success [21m i l a r to WOM, con s um ers also tend to rely on the experts 
reviews to learn about experience goods. Experts are usually neither producers nor consumers, and therefore consumers believe that the information is reliable. This in turn influences the selection process of consumers  the motion picture industry, critical reviews are usually available in daily newspapers, and they provide the critic s preferences about movies with comments Critical reviews are also found on the Internet. Daily newspapers usually have their own websites which are filled with nearly identical or more detailed content 
compared to the printed version. Moreover, many other portals and websites provide critical reviews. In South Korea, however, the critical reviewing system by daily newspapers does not exist, and so critical reviews from the movie section of a portal were adapted for analysis The purpose of this study is to figure out how WOM and critical reviews impact weekly box office revenues and how the impact is different on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. Gemser, Van Oostrum et al showed that critical reviews have different effect on mainstream movies and art house movies Moreover, Liu showed that the volume of the previous

advantages of the previous studies. Furthermore, this study has several distinguishing characteristics compared to those of Liu or Gemser, Van Oostrum et al. First, this study uses data from the motion picture market of South Korea, while many other literatures including Liu dealt with data from the United States or Europe. Second, in this study, movies are categorized into two groups, mainstream movies and nonmainstream, in order to study how WOM and critical reviews impact the box office revenue of these two categories of movies   2. Theoretical background  In general, it is not easy to forecast success of a movie in terms of box office revenue, and the motion picture industry is well known for its high risks [25   Researchers have been trying to determine the attributes that affect the success of the motion picture industry p art f r o m attribu t es su c h as  m o v i e  features, ticket pricing, and advertising, it is suggested that WOM and critical reviews highly influence the box office for movies [13, 14, 17, 21  2.1. Word-Of-Mouth \(WOM  WOM has two important attributes; volume and valen e refers to th e total a m o u nt of WOM, and research suggests that a higher volume of WOM about a product indicates that there might be higher awareness of th ce ref e rs to  the attitude of WOM, which could be positive negative, neutral, or mixed. Duan et al. determined that the volume highly influences on the box office revenue, but the valence does no  T h ere are  several reasons why the volume of WOM matters First, consumers tend to spread information about a product more actively if they are more aware of it Second, the marketing effort of a movie is strongly connected to the volume of WOM. Therefore, it is possible to assume that a movie with high volume of WOM might be involved in a lot of efforts on marketing such as advertising. For valence, especially since a movie is an experience good, it intuitively makes sense that the valence of WOM influences consumers choices. Liu \(2006\owever, claims that there is a very weak relationship between attitude and behavior of customers, and the results of his study also showed that there is no significant relationship between the valence of WOM and box office revenue. This implies that WOM in the motion picture industry is informative, but not persuasive. Thus we propose the following two hypotheses to corroborate his study with regards to the South Korean movie box office H1: The volume of previous week s WOM is positively correlated to weekly box office revenue H2: The valence of previous week s WOM has no significant impact on weekly box office revenue  2.2. Critical Reviews  According to the existing literature, critical reviews have two main roles. First, critical reviews can potentially forecast the success or failure of movies and this is referred to as the prediction effect. In the motion picture industry, the prediction effect of critical reviews is very well known, and sometimes it is even manipu d  critical rev i e w s can influence consumers selection of movies, and this is referred to as the influence effect. Reinstein and Snyder showed that the influence of the iconic two thumbs up movie review, \(a very positive critical review\has a positive impact on weekend box office revenu  Moreover, if we measure the portion of negative critical reviews, we can also expect that negative critical reviews would have a significant impact on weekly box office revenue. On weekly box office revenue, however, prior research has reported that critical reviews have no consistent effect on weekly box office revenu h u s  w e propos e th e following hypotheses  H3: Critical reviews will have no consistent effects on weekly box office revenue H4a: Critical reviews may have a statistically significant impact on aggregate box office revenue H4b: The positive critical reviews would have positive impact, while the negative critical reviews would have negative impact on aggregate box office revenue  2.3. Different Category of Movies  There have been some prior efforts to study the different effects of critical reviews on different categories of movies. Gemser, Van Oostrum et al divided movies into two categories: art house movies and mainstream movies h e hy poth e s i s o f t h e  study was that critical reviews would have an influence effect only on art house movies because there are fewer sources which could provide consumers information about non-mainstream movies as compared to mainstream movies. The result confirmed the hypothesis. In this study, we assume that the prediction effect and the influence effect of critical reviews can be matched to volume and valence of WOM, i.e. volume of WOM can have prediction effect and valence of WOM can have influence effect  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 
 


H5a: WOM will impact the weekly box office revenue of mainstream movies and non-mainstream movies differently H5b: WOM will impact the aggregate box office revenue of mainstream movies and non-mainstream movies differently H6a: Critical reviews will impact the weekly box office revenue of mainstream movies and non-mainstream movies differently H6b: Critical reviews will impact the aggregate box office revenue of mainstream movies and non-mainstream movies differently  3. Data Collection  For this study, data was collected from several sources. At first, data on 400 movies that were released in South Korea in 2006 was collected, and after filtering the data based on certain criteria, 118 movies remained. The criteria consisted of two bases: First movies must have more than six weeks of life cycle Second, data must not have missing values. Table 1 shows the summary statistic of the data used in this study. Usually the data tends to have high standard deviation and the difference between median and mean is quite big. That means the distribution of data, such as box office revenue, number of moviegoers, and volume of WOM messages, is widespread. WOM and critical reviews tend to be positive. The median percentage of positive WOM and critical reviews is 60% and 40 respectively, while the median percentage of negative WOM and critical reviews is 6% and 0% respectively This phenomenon meets with that of Hollywood in literatu  Table 1.

Data is collected for just 6 weeks. All Currency used in this study is USD \(1USD 1000KRW helps to understand the amount  3.1. Box Office Data   Weekly box office revenue was collected from the database website \(www.kobis.or.kr\which is run by the Korean Film Council \(KOFIC\The website provides a search engine that can provide release date, number of moviegoers, box office revenue, number of screens and ranking of movies. Moreover, users can make queries for a specific date range. Therefore, once the release dates of movies were known, it was possible to calculate the weekly box office revenue  3.2. Critical Reviews and WOM Data  The critical reviews and WOM data were collected from Naver Movie s Rating and Review boards. Naver is a portal which is based on Korean language and provides similar services to Yahoo! rather than Google and it has the highest market share in South Korea Rating and Review boards of Naver Movie is quite active, and it may be the most accessible source of online information for most Korean Internet users. The average number of ratings for a movie that used in this study was about 743 Rating and Review board consists of three sections Ratings, Netizen Reviews, and Related Articles. It is likely that all three sections could be involved in WOM data, but only Ratings section data was used for this study due to the tedious nature of the data collection involved. It may be controversial to use Ratings data for WOM instead of Netizen Reviews because the title of the later, Netizen Reviews, seems to be more relevant to WOM. Netizen Reviews section, however has some limitations. First, it does not contain messages before release of movies, and as such it is not appropriate for prerelease analysis. Second, Netizen Reviews section provides starring score, but it is not counted for the representative rating of movies However, the average rating score of Ratings section is provided as representative user rating information Finally, the number of messages in Netizen Review section is less than those of Ratings section for most movies Critical reviews in the United States are usually provided by daily newspapers. In South Korea however, daily newspapers do not provide critical reviews of movies, and so it was obviously impossible to gather the data from newspapers. However, critical reviews are usually found in weekly magazines and websites in South Korea. Naver Movie contains expert ratings with short comments in the Ratings section which are provided by two major movie magazines and this data was used as critical reviews in this study Each movie has its own volume of the expert ratings Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 
 


and the attitude of ratings by numbered ratings between one to ten, and good or bad system WOM data is collected from the Ratings section of Rating and Review boards on the Naver Movie website. Due to each message has rating which is numbered between of one to ten and short comments, it had to be done to categorize the ratings to positive or negative. By analyzing the content and rating of some messages, it is determined that the ratings numbered one and two are categorized as negative WOM and nine and ten as positive WOM Figure 1 is a sample of Naver Movie Rating and Review section. The original layout is different to Figure 1, and it was just edited due to the restriction of space. Upper part of the picture shows the main information of a movie and lower part shows the Netizen Ratings and Critical Ratings, used as reviews in this study   Figure 1. Sample of Naver Movie Rating and Review Section \(edited  3.3. Movie Categorization  To see the different effects and behavior of WOM on different movie categories, categorization of movies had to take place before analysis. Many different schemas to categorize movies such as by genre, by production budget, by country, and so on have been suggested previously. In this study, movies were categorized into two groups: mainstream and nonmainstream movies. Mainstream movies refer to movies that are comparably more commercial and less artistic. Non-mainstream movies refer to movies that are comparably less commercial and more artistic There are also many ways to determine how the degree to which a movie is commercial or artistic. In the literature, previously used criteria include the share of screens ovie s t ar eff e c t 26 th e con t en t, g e n r e or narrative structu d th e m a r k et role of distributors [23, 31 th is s t u d y  t h e m a rk et role of distributors was adopted as a means to categorize movies. Movie distributors tend to avoid investing in movies that do not seem likely to succeed in the market based on past experience and data, or in movies in which no highly reputed stars are involved. This makes distribution of movies skewed and distributors tend to establish their identities by choosing either mainstream movies or non-mainstream movies In this study, movies were categorized into either mainstream or non-mainstream by the distributor of the movies. There are 10 major distributors in South Korea including CJ Entertainment, ShowBox, UIP Korea, and others. According to the annual report from KOFIC in 2006, the top 10 distributors accounted for 94.5% of the market share in Seou T h eref ore, if a m o v i e  was distributed by one of the top 10 distributors, then the movie was assumed to be a mainstream movie. The other movies were assumed to be non-mainstream movies. Table 2 shows the comparison of mainstream and non-mainstream movies. As expected, nonmainstream movies had much less moviegoers, box office revenue, and volume of WOM. The number of critical reviews was not very different between mainstream movies and non-mainstream movies  Table 2.

Data is collected for just 6 weeks All Currency used in this study is USD \(1USD = 1000KRW helps to understand the amount  3.4. Other Data  For more detailed analysis, data on several other movie-attributes were collected. First, genre of movies was coded into action and adventure \(GACADV comedy \(GCMD\cience fiction \(GSCIFI\mance GRMC\, or drama \(GDRM\. Some movies were not classified into a genre, and so a representative genre was selected. Second, in South Korea, there is a movie rating system by the Korea Media Rating Board, akin to the MPAA rating in United States. Movies are classified as suitable for all ages or prohibited for viewers under 12, 15, or 18 \(RATE12, RATE15 RATE18\Third, the star effect was also coded as a Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 
 


dummy variable. If there was at least one famous star appeared in a movie or the director of the movie was well known, it was assumed that the movie had star effect. Finally, the competition effect was coded. To measure the degree of competition, two variables were introduced; weekly average age of the top 20 movies in terms of box office revenue, and number of new releases among the top 20 movies, and this technique is same as Liu s on a bl e 3 s h o w s t h e l i s t a n d  description of variables used in this study  Table 3.

Result and Discussion  4.1. Weekly Patterns of Box Office Revenue and WOM  Figure 2 and 3 illustrate the dynamic patterns of average box office revenue and WOM for mainstream and non-mainstream movies, beginning with W 0 which stands for the prerelease period. It seems that the general patterns of weekly box office revenue and volume of previous week s WOM fit well for both mainstream and non-mainstream movies. According to some literatures, the pattern of WOM volume has its highest amount in first or second week after movie released[16 an d th e pattern of  m a i n s t rea m  m o v i es fits with it The pattern of non-mainstream movies, however seems different. WOM volume has its highest amount in prerelease period, and drops continuously except for the small rising in W 2 It may be not appropriate to accept the result and discuss it in any detail with just the average values pattern, having no detailed statistical analysis. However, there would be a high possibility that this different pattern of WOM in mainstream and non-mainstream movies was caused by the different features or customer behavior for the different category of movies, and that would be an interesting topic for further study    Figure 2.

In this study, data analysis showed that the number of screens could be a dependent variable rather than independent variable, as the correlation between the box office revenue and the number of screen was very high. Moreover, the effect of negative critical reviews is one of the important attributes in this study. For those reasons, the previous model \(1\was estimated  Table 4.

For all weeks, models were statistically significant with high level of fit. The volume of previous week s WOM \(LNMSG t-1 ad significant positive effect on weekly box office revenue for all six weeks, and this result supports H1. The valence of WOM, however, does not show any consistent result. It is significant for week 3 and 4, but the sign of POSPER t-1 is reverse. This result supports H2 and so far the results do not seem different to that of Liu. Therefore, generally in the motion picture industry, online WOM is only informative, not persuasive. This result supports the results that consumers attitudes do not always relate to their actions in behavioral studies [33    Critical reviews were usually not significantly related to the weekly box office revenue except for some weeks. The number of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews have significant relationship with weekly box office revenue only once each, and there was no week that the percentage of positive reviews had significant result. This result was expected \(H3\ and also reported by some literatures  To ex a m in e th e res u lt i n  m o re detail, a n  additional analysis was performed taking only the factors which are related to critical reviews LNCRITIC, CRPRO, CRCON\to account. Table 5 shows the regression result of weekly box office revenue with only critical reviews for its independent variables. The result was quite different to that of model \(1\e number of critical reviews was positively significant with high level of fit for all six weeks. This implies that more reviewers are interested in movies with high likelihoods of success at the box office. Second, the attitude of critical reviews was also significant. Critical reviews with positive attitude were significant for five weeks out of six weeks, and three weeks for negative critical reviews. One thing impressive is that the signs of coefficients were consistent in reverse throughout six weeks. One thing impressive is that CRPRO and CRCON both had unexpected signs of coefficients. All CRPRO had negative signs implying that a greater percentage of positive critical reviews led to lower box office revenues, and conversely, all CRCON had positive signs. This implies that the preferences of critical reviewers on movies are generally far from that of normal moviegoers  Table 5.

4.3. Weekly Box Office Revenue for Different Category of Movies  The model \(1\was applied separately to mainstream movies and non-mainstream movies to determine the different effects of attributes on mainstream movies and non-mainstream movies. Table 6 shows the regression result on mainstream movies and nonmainstream movies. Except for the first week of mainstream movies, all 11 models were statistically significant. Mainstream movies have many sources from which people can get information, and usually have more marketing budget in terms of advertisement or star casting. Model \(1\, however, has only WOM critical reviews, and competition factors for its independent variables. Therefore, the insignificant result of the mainstream movies first week is understandable. From now, discussion will ignore the results for the first week of mainstream movies The volume of WOM has significant positive effects both on mainstream movies and non-mainstream movies, but the valence does not. While there were some weeks in non-mainstream movies where the result was significant, it is barely possible to determine that there are consistent differences between two categories of movies. Thus, H5a is rejected. There could be several reasons for this: First of all, when people read or write about movies and their personal thoughts, which then become WOM, they are less likely to know whether the movies are mainstream or non-mainstream. The Internet, especially the NAVER Movie portal, provides almost identical quality or format of information regardless of the movie type This may give people the same opportunity to be involved in WOM of two different categories of movies. Second, similar to mainstream movies, nonmainstream movies also have many other sources from which consumers can get information. If consumers can get information from other channels, there would be a greater likelihood that consumers rely on other information channels, thereby weakening the influence of valence of WOM. It would explain the insignificance of the valence of WOM for both mainstream and non-mainstream movies The result for critical reviews was not clear. Both the number and attitude of critical reviews were not significant, and some of them had unexpected signs similar to the result of model \(1\ the previous analysis, it was also seen that the positive critical reviews gave negative effect on box office revenue Here, the percentage of positive critical reviews was never significant for non-mainstream movies, but negative critical reviews were significant for three weeks in mainstream movies. This means that consumers likely do not usually watch mainstream movies that critical reviewers gave positive ratings However this does not hold true for non-mainstream movies. The result implies that the gap between the preferences of critics and normal moviegoers is bigger in mainstream movies. In that sense, H6a is supported   4.4. Aggregate Box Office Revenue  The estimated model for aggregate box office revenue is  2\NTOTALREV i CONST + a 1 LNMSG i0 a 2 POSPER i0  a 3 NEGPER io a 4 LNCRITIC i a 5 CRPRO i  a 6 CRCON i  i   where i for each movies \(i=1,2 118\ The dependent variable is the aggregate box office revenues for the entire lifespan of movies \(not just for six weeks WOM data used in this model was only prerelease data LNMSG 0 POSPER 0 NEGPER 0 d attributes for critical reviews were added \(LNCRITIC, CRPRO CRCON\ This model is also followed by Liu s one with some changes. The model was applied separately to overall movies data, only mainstream movies data and non-mainstream movies data. Table 7 shows the regression result on aggregate box office revenue The volume of prerelease WOM is positively significant for all three categories. That means the amount of WOM before the release of movies may give influence on the success of movies. The effect was highest in mainstream movies. However, the valence of prerelease WOM was not significant for all categories Even though non-mainstream movies had expected signs for the percentage of positive and negative WOM, the results were not significant. Thus, H5b is rejected There were differences in the impact of critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies While the number of critics and the percentage of negative critics were significant in non-mainstream movies, there was no relationship between mainstream movies and critical reviews. In the case of WOM, there were no differences between two categories of movies because it is likely that there are many other informational sources for both. The case of critical reviews, however, was a bit different. Due to the fact that consumers can get critical reviews only from online and offline movie magazines or movie sections of some portals, there are not many sources for critical reviews of non-mainstream movies. Moreover, the accessibility of critical reviews is less than WOM. This means consumers need to put more effort into read critical reviews of non-mainstream movies, and there would be a greater likelihood of consumers gets influenced.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue th e resu lts on  th e  Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 
 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3\ the other hand, H4a was supported, but not H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a\t no expected result came out for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b\alyze the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies  box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it   Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
