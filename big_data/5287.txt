Perhaps it is not surprising then, that these clusters have many genes involved in myelin biogenesis and fatty acid biosynthesis. It is interesting that one of the genes in the 17 th cluster of molecular function is involved in selenium metabolism suggesting a role for selenium in white matter synthesis. Genes in the 26 th cluster of biological process are largely expressed in the hypothalamus, an area with many nuclei and hence rich in nerve terminals. Consistent with this, the cluster has many genes involved in protein transport. The interpretation of the remaining of significant itemsets will be reported in a future paper In our future work, we will further explore the algorithms and techniques to mine the gene expression maps based on the significant clusters. Since our proposed approach of association rule mining of gene functions is, so far, based on determining the same GO terms \(gene functions\, we can extend the method by using the similarity values of pairs of gene functions in the GO structure. This means that if two functions are very similar to each other or one is a parent of the other even though they have different GO ID, we can consider the two functions as being the same. So the rules can possibly be merged into more general rules without loosing relevant information. We will try different algorithms of association rule mining and propose the most suitable methods to fit our data. We also plan to add other features besides the gene functions, such as the label of significant cluster or the wavelet features extracted from the gene maps. Most importantly, one can predict gene functions by the association rules we found in the significant clusters This is due to the fact that the particular patterns of gene expression maps have high probability to have similar gene functions to the detected frequent itemsets Acknowledgements     This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants IIS-0705215 IIS-0237921 and by the National Institutes of Health under grant R01 MH68066-04 funded by NIMH NINDS and NIA, NINDS grant 1 R01 NS050148, and also by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health \(NIH\, National Library of Medicine \(NLM\.
