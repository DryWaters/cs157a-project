The amount of data now\ncirculating on the Internet is over zettabytes \(ZB Big Data. In order to handle\nsuch challenging scenario, the deployed solutions rely not only\non massive storage, memory and processing capacity installed in\nData Centers \(DC globe,\nbut also on shrewd computational techniques, such as BigTable,\nMapReduce and Dynamo. In this context this work presents\na DC structure designed to support the similarity search. The\nproposed solution aims at concentrating similar data on servers\nphysically close within a DC. It accelerates the recovery of all\ndata related to queries performed using a primitive get\(k, sim the data used as\nreference, and sim a similarity level.\nIndex Terms—Similarity Search, Big Data, Data Center Ham-\nming similarity\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn the current Big Data scenario of Internet, users have\nbecome data sources; companies store uncountable infor-\nmation from clients; millions of sensors monitor the real\nworld creating and exchanging data in the Internet of things.\nAccording to a study from the International Data Corporation\n\(IDC  2010, doubling every two\nyears, and might surpass 8 ZB in 2015. The study also\nrevealed that approximately 90 of them are composed by\nunstructured, heterogeneous and variable data in nature, such\nas texts, images and videos.\nEmerging technologies, such as Hadoop [2] and MapRe-\nduce [3], are examples of solutions designed to address the\nchallenges imposed by Big Data in the so called three Vs:\nVolume, Variety and Velocity. Through parallel computing\ntechniques in conjunction with grid computing and/or, re-\ncently, taking advantage of the DCs infrastructure offered by\nthe cloud computing concept, the IT organizations offer means\nfor handling large-scale, distributed and data-intensive jobs\nacross commodity servers. Usually, such technologies offer\na distributed ?le system and automated tools for adjusting,\non the ?y, the number of servers involved in the processing\ntasks. In such case, large volumes of data are pushed over\nthe networking facility connecting the servers, transferring\n< key, value > pairs from mappers to reducers in order\nto obtain the desirable results Extensions like [4] avoid all\nthe reprocessing of information stored in the distributed ?le\nsystems, also minimizing the need for moving data across the\nnetwork in order to speed up the overall processing task.\nWhile the current solutions are unquestionably ef?cient for\nhandling traditional applications, such as batch processing of\nlarge volumes of data, they do not offer adequate support for\nthe similarity search [5], whose objective is the retrieval of\nsets of similar data given by a similarity level. In previous\nworks [6], an overlay solution for the similarity search was\ndeveloped on top of a Distributed Hash Table \(DHT structure.\nEssentially, it was con?rmed that it is possible to assign\nidenti?ers to data representing, with an elevated accuracy level,\nthe similarity existent between them by the Hamming distance\nof their identi?ers de?ned in this paper as their Hamming\nsimilarity storing\nsimilar data in servers close in the logical space of the overlay\nnetwork by using a put\(k, v primitive, and that it is also\npossible to ef?ciently recover a set of similar data by using\na single get\(k sim the main objective is to present a DC\nstructure, named Hamming Cube \(HCube demonstrating the feasibility of storing similar data in\npeers physically near, as opposed to the logical neighborhood\ncharacteristic of the previous overlay solution, which does not\nnecessarily represent physical distance. Although it is in early\nstage, the results indicate its feasibility, and serves as basis\nfor the development of solutions for several applications such\nas recommender systems for social networks and/or medical\nimages repositories, in which queries for similar past diagnoses\nmay help in a new treatment.\nTo achieve this goal, the HCube includes a data representa-\ntion model, a Locality Sensitive Hashing \(LSH function [5],\na data storage infrastructure and a routing solution. For the\ndata representation, the HCube uses a vector representation,\nin which each dimension is related to a characteristic of the\ndata being stored such as keywords in a text, color histogram\nin a picture or pro?le attributes in a social network. In order\nto index the data, HCube adopts the Random Hyperplane\nHashing Function \(RHH  whose\nsimilarity corresponds to the cosine of the angle between vec-\ntors. The data storage infrastructure of HCube uses servers as\n2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and 


Applications\n1550-445X/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/AINA.2013.139\n82\ndata repositories, and it is inspired in the 3-cube server-centric\nsolution from BCube [8]. Also, the servers are responsible for\nrouting queries to their neighbors in order to retrieve all the\ndesirable data regarding the get\(k, sim HCube,\nservers are organized according to the Gray code sequence\n[9], and each server is connected to six other servers whose\nidenti?ers present Hamming distances equal to 1. The routing\nsolution used in the HCube adopts an XOR-based ?at routing\napproach [10].\nTo evaluate the HCube proposal, the Adult Data Set of\nthe UCI Repository [11] was used as adult pro?les in a\nsocial network. For these pro?les, hash identi?ers were created\nusing the RHH function and stored in the servers composing\nthe HCube. Four cubes ranging from 1024 to 8192 servers\nwere analyzed. Afterwards, queries for similar pro?les were\nperformed and the distance between servers that store similar\npro?les was measured. Also, the recall versus the number of\nhops is presented to show the ef?ciency of the proposed solu-\ntion. To complement the evaluations, the Hamming similarity\napproach was validated by showing the correlation between the\nsimilarity extracted from the cosine of the adult vectors and\nthe Hamming similarity between adult and server identi?ers.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section\nII presents the concept of cosine similarity \(simcos simh routing. Section IV presents the evaluation\nresults while Section V provides some ?nal remarks about our\nproposal. Section VI concludes this paper.\nII. DATA MODEL AND THE RANDOM HYPERPLANE\nHASHING\nConsider an application scenario in which pro?les of users\nare represented by 2-dimensional vectors, each dimension\nrepresenting the interest of the user in two subjects, for\nexample A and B. These interests are represented by values\nfrom 0 up to 10 \(0 means that the user is not interested at all\nabout the subject and 10 means the user is totally interested\non it represented by the tuples PROFILE1\(3,7 9,1 subject A and 1 for subject B, and PROFILE3\(5,5 8 10\nIn\nte\nre\nst\n:B\nInterest: A\nPROFILE1\nPROFILE2\nPROFILE3\nNEW PROFILE\nFig. 1. Interest space for PROFILE1 PROFILE2, PROFILE3 and\nNEW PROFILE.\nBased on these pro?les, consider a friend recommender\nsystem and a new user pro?le represented by the tuple\nNEW PROFILE\(6,2 question is: what are the most similar pro?les\nto recommend to the user represented by NEW PROFILE?\nA common option found in literature is the cosine similarity.\nGiven two vectors, the value of the cosine of the angle between\nthem, which ranges from 0 to 1, may be used as a similarity\nindex; 0 meaning that both vectors have no similarity at all\nand 1 meaning that both vectors are totally similar. The choice\nof the similarity function highly depends on the application\ndomain. In [12] it is stated that the cosine similarity produces\nhigh quality results for different types of data and application\nscenarios. This paper focused on the cosine similarity.\nThe Locality Sensitive Hashing \(LSH while ensuring that the\nmore similar two objects are, the more similar the hash values\nof their vectors will be [5]. Each family of LSH functions is\nrelated to some similarity function. The Random Hyperplane\nHashing RHH 7]\npresents a hashing technique summarized in the sequence.\nGiven a set ??r 1,\n??r 2, . . . ,\n??r m of m vectors\n??r ? d, each\nof their coordinates randomly drawn from a standard normal\ndistribution, and a vector u ? d, a hash function h??r is\nde?ned as follows:\nh??r \(\n??u 0\nFor each h??r \(\n??u n??u m-bit hash key\nfor this vector ??u . For two data vectors ??u ,??v ? d, the\nprobability of generating similar keys is the value of the cosine\nof the angle between ??u and ??v . Consequently, the greater the\ncosine similarity, the more likely the generated keys will share\ncommon bits, leading to two identi?ers close in the Hamming\ndistance \(i.e. the number of different bits in two binary strings is possible to be calculated\nby measuring simh = 1-\nDh\nm\n, in which simh is the Hamming\nsimilarity and Dh is the Hamming distance.\nAs an example, assuming that an application uses an iden-\nti?er of 8-bits, a sequence of m = 8 random vectors ??r\nmust be generated, and the returned bits of the m h??r are\nconcatenated in order to generate an 8-bit identi?er. Based\nin the scenario previously presented in Figure 1, Table I\ncompares the cosine similarity \(simcos Dh simh pro?le to NEW PROFILE based on cosine similarity,\nalso has the smallest Hamming distance \(Dh corresponding\nto a Hamming similarity \(simh operation of HCube.\nIII. THE HCUBE ARCHITECTURE\nThis section provides an overall description of the HCube\narchitecture, exhibiting the organization of servers inside the\n83\nTABLE I\nHAMMING DISTANCE \(Dh

As seen\nin Figure 2, the logical organization of HCube is composed\nof two layers, the Admission Layer and the Storage Layer.\nFig. 2. H-cube operation in a query.\nThe Admission Layer provides the interface between the\nexternal world and the HCube structure. This layer is com-\nposed by a set of Admission Servers, which operate on top of\nthe HCube receiving the queries from the users/applications\nand preparing such queries for being injected in the HCube in\norder to perform the similarity search. For simplicity, Figure\n2 shows only one Admission Server at the Admission Layer.\nOn the top left corner of Figure 2, it is presented a query\nvector ??q composed of d dimensions being admitted by the\nHCube, in conjunction with the desirable similarity level sim.\nThe designation of the Admission Server to be in charge of\nhandling such query may be set according to, for example, the\ngeographic region from where the query is originated.\nOnce the query vector ??q is received, the Admission Server\nobtains the data identi?er di according to the process described\nin Section II which has 128-bits length in Figure 2. The di\nis the data identi?er of reference for the similarity search\nprocess. In the sequence, the Admission Server reduces the di,\nalso using the RHH function, aimed at obtaining the identi?er\nsi, which indicates the Hosting Server responsible for the\nreference data di. In this example, the si has 6-bits length,\nresulting in a HCube composed by 64 servers \(4x4x4 servers query ??q , a get composed by\nthe reference data identi?er di, the hosting server si and\nthe desirable sim level is issued in the Storage Layer. Such\nmessage is routed towards si by using the XOR Routing\npresented later in Section III-C and, from the hosting server si,\na series of get\(di, sim forwarded\nto the neighboring servers also using the XOR mechanism.\nThe generation of such get\(di, sim messages is driven\nby some factors, including the reference data di and the\ndesirable sim level. Speci?cally for the purposes of this paper,\nthe get\(di, sim crescent order of Hamming distances between\nserver identi?ers, since the objective is to provide a full\nanalysis of the distance between servers storing similar data\nand the recall in which similar data is recovered.\nAs the get messages are routed inside HCube, the servers\ncontaining data within the desirable sim level forward them to\nthe Admission Server responsible for handling such request at\nthe Admission Layer. The Admission Server summarizes the\nanswers and delivers the set of similar data to the requesting\nuser/application, concluding the similarity search process. As\nan alternative implementation, the Admission Server may\nreturn a list of references to the similar data, instead of\nreturning the entire data set. Such option avoids unnecessary\nmovement of huge volumes of data and allows the users to\nchoose what piece of data they really want to retrieve, for\nexample, a doctor may open only a few past diagnoses related\nto the current treatment.\nA. HCube structure\nThe HCube is composed of a set of servers organized\nin a 3-dimensional cube topology, in which servers are the\nfundamental elements in the DC \(server-centric paradigm server-centric scheme, simple COTS \(commodity\noff-the-shelf wiring\nprocess of the DC, or direct links can be established among\nthe servers. The most important characteristic of the server-\ncentric scheme is that network elements, like switches, are\nnot involved in the traf?c forwarding decisions, they simple\nprovide connections between servers, which are responsible\nfor all the traf?c forwarding decisions.\nEach HCube server comprises a general purpose processor,\nwith memory persistent storage and six NICs \(Network In-\nterface Cards axis \(x, y and z the\nx axis, the NICs eth2 and eth3 in the y axis, and the NICs\neth4 and eth5 in the z axis.\nIn order to provide a greater degree of alternative paths\nin the HCube, increase the fault tolerance and reduce the\nmaximum distance between any pairs of servers, the adopted\ntopology wraps all the links between edge servers, in all the\nthree axis. Figure 3 presents a HCube topology composed of\ntwenty seven servers. Note in this ?gure the existence of six\n84\nNICs in all servers, the linkage in the three axis, and the\nwrapping connections between the edge servers.\nFig. 3. HCube with 27 servers \(x = 3, y = 3 and z = 3 server identi?ers\nIn order to facilitate the similarity search, the HCube adopts\nGray codes for assigning identi?ers to all servers composing\nits structure. By using the Gray codes [9], two successive\nidenti?ers of servers differ in only one bit, i.e., neighboring\nservers present Hamming distance 1 between their identi?ers,\ntending to store similar data.\nThe proposed organization follows the Gray Space Filling\nCurve SFC  and\nit is specialized in the clustering of data according to their\nHamming distances. In Figure 4 it is shown 


as an example,\na HCube with 64 storage servers \(identi?ers of 6-bits length gure presents the four\nlayers \(L1, L2, L3 and L4 presented in Section III-A.\nAs an example, consider the server 29 \(0111012 neighbors of this server are\n28 \(0111002, L2 0111112, L2 0110012, L2 0101012, L2 0011012, L1 1111012, L3 neighbors present identi?ers whose Hamming distance\nto server 29 is equal to 1.\nAs another example, in which links between edge servers\nare established, consider server 60 \(1111002 neighbors of this server are 62 \(1111102,\nL3 1111012, L3 1101002, L3 1110002, L3 1011002, L4 0111002, L2 presenting\nHamming distance 1 to the identi?er of server 60.\nL1 =\n?\n???\n8 9 11 10\n12 13 15 14\n4 5 7 6\n0 1 3 2\n?\n???

However, for\nHCubes with size bigger than 64 servers the identity space for\nde?ning the identi?ers of servers must be bigger than 6-bits,\nresulting in more than 6 servers whose Hamming distance\nis equal to 1. In short, it means that 6 servers presenting\nHamming distance 1 will always be directly connected to\na given server, and the remaining servers whose Hamming\ndistance is 1 will be placed in a higher number of hops.\nFigure 5 exempli?es a HCuber bigger than 6-bits, showing\nthe layers an 8x4x4 \(7-bits by the arrows, and consider server\n9 \(00010012 distance 1 servers, organized as follows: servers 8\n\(00010002, L1 00010112, L1 servers\n25 \(00110012, L1 00000012, L1 01010012, L2 10010012, L4 in the z axis and,\n?nally, server 13 \(00011012, L1 It is important to highlight that\nthe distance in hops to server 13 is reduced given the wrapped\nlinks established between edge servers of HCube.\nFig. 5. Gray SFC in a 8x4x4 HCube \(128 servers cube must have n dimensions, in\nwhich n is the number of bits of the identity space used for\nservers. Although such structure will have the better results in\na similarity search using the Hamming similarity, it is very\ndif?cult to be deployed and far from the real DCs wiring\nstructures. In this way, the 3-dimensional structure of HCube\noffers a good trade-off between the complexity of the cube\nand the results \(recall similarity search.\nC. XOR Routing\nThe XOR metric uses n-bit ?at identi?ers to organize the\nrouting tables in n columns and route packets through the\nnetwork. Its routing principle uses the bit-wise exclusive or\n\(XOR operation between two server identi?ers a and b as\ntheir distance, which is represented by d\(a, b being\nd\(a, a a, b denoting Y as the set\nof identi?ers contained on x’s routing table, the XOR-based\nrouting mechanism applied at server x selects a server y ? Y\n85\nthat minimizes the distance towards z, which is expressed by\nthe following routing policy\nR = argmin\ny?Y\n{d\(y, z 1 tables maintained per server are formed by O\(n into n\ncolumns called buckets and represented by ?i, 0 ? i ? n? 1.\nEach time a server a knows a novel neighbor b, it stores the\ninformation regarding server b in the bucket ?n?1?i given the\nhighest i that satis?es the following condition1\nd\(a, b 2 routing tables,\nconsider the ?rst example given in Section III-B, assuming\nserver 29 as a = 011101 and its neighbor 13 as b = 001101.\nThe distance d\(a, b 2 i = 4, concluding that the identi?er\nb = 001101 must be stored in the bucket ?n?1?i = ?1.\nBasically, condition 2 pre?x \(lcp buckets\n?0, ?1, ?2, ?3, ?4, ?5 store the identi?ers having lcp of length\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with server 29 011101 011101 IN WHICH n = 6.\n?0 ?1 ?2 ?3 ?4 ?5\n111101 001101 010101 011001 011111 011100\n100000 000000 010000 011000 011110\n100010 000100 010100 011010\n111111 001111 010111 011011\nSuch routing tables approach is one of the main advantages\nof the XOR-based mechanism, since a server only needs to\nknow one neighbor per bucket of the possible 2n servers avail-\nable in the network to successfully route packets. If a server\nhas more than one entry per bucket, such additional entries\nmight optimize the routing process, reducing the number of\nhops in the path from source to destination. Another important\ncharacteristic of this routing table is related to the 


number\nof servers that ?t in each one of the buckets. There is only\none server that ?t in the last bucket 5 0 t in such bucket \(32 servers for n = 6 servers limited to four lines.\nAfterwards, assuming the Gray code distribution of server\nidenti?ers adopted in HCube, ?lling the buckets is easier,\nsince each one of the Hamming distance 1 neighbors ?t in\nexactly one bucket of the routing table, assuring all the traf?c\nforwarding inside the HCube. Note in the ?rst line of Table II\n1div denotes the integer division operation on integers.\nthe intentional presence of all servers whose identi?ers present\nHamming distance 1 to server 29 \(011101 in ?2, 011001 in ?3, 011111 in ?4\nand 011100 in ?5. As mentioned before, for HCubes bigger\nthan sixty four servers \(6-bits In\nthis case, a signaling process [10] is used to discover the other\nservers located at distances bigger than 1 hop.\nIV. EVALUATION\nThis section describes the experiments performed in the\nevaluation of the HCube proposal. The main idea is to validate\nour proposal as a valuable approach in order to support the\nsearching for similar data. In our experiments, data is viewed\nas pro?les of a Social Network represented by adult vectors\nextracted from the Adult Data Set of the UCI Repository [11].\nThis set contains 99762 queries and 199523 adults. In essence,\nit contains information about adult citizens living in the US,\nincluding: age work-class, education level, years in school,\nmarital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain\nand loss over the last year, hours worked per week, native\ncountry and annual salary. Samples of these pro?les are shown\nin the sequence:\n• ADULT1 - 43; Self-emp-not-inc; 5th-6th; 3; Married-civ-\nspouse Craft-repair; Husband; White; Male; 0; 4700; 20;\nUnited-States; ?50K\n• ADULT2 - 56; Private; 10th; 6 Married-civ-spouse;\nCraft-repair; Husband; White; Male; 0; 0; 0.45; France;\n?50K\n• ADULT3 - 50; Self-emp-inc Prof-school; 15; Married-\nciv-spouse; Prof-specialty; Husband; White; Male; 0; 0;\n36; United-States; ?50K\n ADULT4 - 30; Private; Prof-school; 15; Married-civ-\nspouse; Prof-specialty; Husband; White; Male; 0; 0 30;\nUnited-States; ?50K\nThe similarity between each pair of adult vectors is deter-\nmined by the cosine of the angle between them. For example,\nthe vectors ADULT1 and ADULT2 have cosine similarity\nequal to 0.71, ADULT3 and ADULT4 have cosine similarity\nequal to 0.90. Table III lists the Hamming distances \(Dh using the RHH function over the vectors rep-\nresenting ADULT1, ADULT2, ADULT3 and ADULT4. Table\nIII also presents the cosine similarity \(simcos Hamming\nsimilarity \(simh Dh SIMILARITY \(simh simcos simcos\nADULT1, ADULT2 28 0.68 0.71\nADULT3, ADULT4 10 0.92 0.90\nTo evaluate the HCube the following experiments were\nperformed:\n86\n• Adult pro?le identi?ers with 128-bits were generated\nusing RHH, indexed and distributed in HCubes with\n1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192 servers;\n• Pro?les in the query set were used as query vectors in\nthe Adult set. Pairs of queries and adults were randomly\nselected to be evaluated considering similarity levels\ngreater than or equal to 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 0.95;\n• A 128-bits identi?er was generated for each query.\nLookups having these identi?ers and a Hamming simi-\nlarity level were performed. To map the hosting server\nfor each query, each 128-bits identi?er was reduced to\na 10-, 11-, 12- and 13-bits identi?er using RHH These\nreduced identi?ers corresponds to the hosting servers of\nthe queries for each evaluated size of HCubes;\n• From the hosting server, all pro?les that ?t within the\nHamming similarity level are retrieved.\nThese tests allow us to highlight the following aspects:\n• The correlation between cosine and Hamming similarity\nof adult identi?ers \(128-bits identi?ers;\n• The frequency distribution of the number of hops to\nretrieve all similar pro?les in the set according to their\nsimilarity level;\n• The query recall, corresponding to the fraction of all\nrelevant pro?les that was successfully retrieved.\nTo perform the tests, adult pro?les were indexed and\ndistributed in the HCube using the put\(k, v k, sim server and its neighbors given an identi?er \(k sim the\nrecall and the number of hops, this search was extended to all\nneighbors of the hosting server in a con?gurable depth.\nA. Correlation\nTable IV shows the average of the correlation between\ncosine similarity simcos simham iden-\nti?ers. Also, the correlation between cosine similarity and the\nHamming similarity of 10-, 11-, 12- and 13-bits hosting server\nidenti?ers is presented. To calculate these correlations we\nrandomly selected 10 samples of queries and adults pro?les,\neach sample containing about 1% of the total number of pairs\nin the Adult set. These samples were sorted according to these\nsimilarity levels: 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 0.95.\nTABLE IV\nAVERAGE OF THE CORRELATION BETWEEN COSINE AND HAMMING\nSIMILARITY.\nsimcos 128-bits 10-bits 11-bits 12-bits

When the similarity\nlevel falls bellow to 0.9 it is possible to notice a moderate\ncorrelation \(< 0.8 identi?ers. Still\nexamining this table, the greater the similarity level, the greater\nthe correlation between cosine similarity of pairs of adults and\nHamming similarity of their hosting server identi?ers.\nThe standard deviation of these averages for the lowest\nsimilarity levels are high due to the probabilistic characteristic\nof the RHH function, but the con?dence interval of the samples\nwere calculated and are low and acceptable. For the highest\nsimilarity levels the standard deviations are negligible, as the\ncon?dence interval of the samples.\nB. Distribution of the number of hops between similar data\nThe results in Figure 6 show that the higher is the similarity\nlevel of a query, the lower is the effort necessary to recover\nsimilar data. As an example, in Figure 6\(a to\n0.7, most of the similar pro?les of a given query are located\nbetween 2 and 6 hops away from the hosting server. It is\nimportant to notice here that using 10-bits in a server identi?er,\na Hamming similarity of 0.7 is equivalent to a Hamming\ndistance of 3, on average. In an HCube with 6-bits \(a complete\nHCube the Hamming distance implies in 3 hops\nfrom source to target. As another example, in Figure 6\(c 10-bits for the server identi?er and a similarity\nlevel of 0.9, most of the similar data associated to a given\nquery is between 0 and 3 hops. A Hamming similarity of 0.9\nin this case means that the Hamming distance between server\nidenti?ers storing those similar data is equal to 1, on average.\nIn a complete Hamming cube with n dimensions, in which\nn is the number of bits of the server identi?er, with a similarity\nlevel sim the maximum number of hops necessary to recover\nsimilar data is n-\(sim*n the maximum number of hops necessary to recover\nall 0.7 similar data is 10-\(0,7*10 values\npresented in the HCube results are due to the reduced number\nof dimensions necessary to build an incomplete Hamming\ncube.

As an example, taking\na HCube with 4096 servers \(12-bits similarity level equal\nto 0.8, 20% of the similar adult pro?les are retrieved using 2\nhops and 50% of them are retrieved with 4 hops. In the same\nscenario, using similarity level of 0.95, 60% of all similar\npro?les are stored in the hosting server, and expanding the\nsearch for its immediate neighbors \(1 hop similar\npro?les are retrieved.\nD. Hamming distances\nThe evaluations in this subsection show the relationship\nbetween the Hamming distances of the servers and the dis-\ntance, measured in the number of hops between them in the\nHCube. The results are presented in Figure 8. In this ?gure\nthe results of a 6-bit HCube are shown as reference because\nin the HCube it represents a complete Hamming cube. As\nsaid earlier, for more than 6-bits in the server identi?er, the\nHCube isn’t complete, characterizing a compromise between\nlower hop distances and the practical implementation of the\nDC. As an example, in a DC with 2048 servers \(11-bits when\ntwo servers present a Hamming distance equal to 1 between\ntheir identi?ers, the average distance measured in the number\nof hops, is about 2.

Combining these results with those presented in\nTable IV, it is possible to con?rm that the HCube is a valuable\napproach to enable similarity search in a Data Center scenario.\nV. FINAL REMARKS\nAmong the related works about similarity search available in\nthe literature, most of them are based on centralized indexing\nschemes [14], [15], hashing functions [5] and SFCs [13].\nSome others are related to overlay solutions in distributed P2P\nenvironments [16], [17], [18], [6], usually focused on large\ndata collections and multimedia data. Both centralized and\ndistributed scenarios are motivated by the nearest neighbors\nproblem [5], i.e., how to retrieve the most similar data in an\nindexing space?\nThe centralized solutions offer ef?cient results by using\nspecialized data structures. To complement such scenario, the\nuse of LSH functions was proposed to solve the curse of\ndimensionality problem [7], which appears when the number\nof dimensions in a data vector increases, making inef?cient\nthe use of SFCs. But, even using LSH to reduce the curse of\ndimensionality, centralized solutions are not suitable for Big\nData due to the huge amount of data to be considered.\nThe overlay approaches appear as solutions to help man-\naging large volumes of data. In general, these solutions are\nbased in Distributed Hash Tables \(DHT network. However, although peers storing\nsimilar data can be nearly located in the overlay network, there\nis no guarantee that they are physically near, usually resulting\nin high latencies during data transfer/recovery.\nWhen compared to these works, HCube is a distributed\nsolution using techniques such as LSH functions and SFCs\nto support similarity searches, but HCube is not based on an\noverlay solution. HCube presents a server-centric data center\nstructure specialized for similarity search, where similar data\nare stored in servers physically near, recovering such data\nin a reduced number of hops and with reduced processing\nrequirements.\nOn the other hand, players such as Google [19] and\nAmazon [20] developed data centers specialized in storing\nand processing large volumes of data through MapReduce\nsolution, but none of them consider the similarity search.\nIn this way, HCube opens up a new research ?eld, where\napplications can bene?t from its similarity search structure,\navoiding processing-intensive tasks as occur in MapReduce,\nsince similar data are organized in servers nearly located\nduring the storing phase.\n88\n020\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nSi\nm\nila\nrC\non\nte\nnt\ns\(\n bits\n\(a bits\n\(b bits\n\(c bits\n\(d a b c d WORK\nHCube is a data center solution designed to support sim-\nilarity searches in Big Data scenarios, aiming to reduce the\ndistance to recover similar contents in a similarity search.\nThe data model used in HCube uses a vector space model\nrepresentation. Through the use of the RHH function to\ngenerate data identi?ers, the cosine similarity is represented\nby the Hamming similarity between them. Correlating data\nidenti?ers and server identi?ers to the cosine similarity we\nwere able to reproduce a scenario in which similar data is\nstored in the same hosting server or in servers with small\nHamming distances in the DC. The use of the Gray SFC in the\norganization of the server identi?ers in the HCube bene?ts our\nsolution, since it ensures that all neighbors of a data storage\nserver are at Hamming distance 1 between them. The 3-cube is\n?at, server-centric and presents multipath routing capabilities,\nincreasing resilience and fault tolerance.\nThe results show that the recall and the number of hops to\nrecover a high amount of similar data enables HCube as a DC\nsolution in a similarity search scenario, which is an interesting\nkind of search due to the high number of related work\ninvolving this subject. The better results were obtained with\nhigh similarity levels. An extra layer in the HCube architecture\ncan be implemented to evaluate the results of a similarity\nsearch, ?ltering and ranking the best answers improving the\nprecision, which corresponds to the ratio between relevant data\nover the total amount of data returned in a query.\nAs future work we plan to evaluate fault tolerance and\nload balance of the HCube. Also, strategies such as content\nreplication and caching can be used to improve recall and load\nbalance, reducing the number of hops to recover similar data.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J. Gantz and D.

and\nlatency.\nConsistency, which has been long studied [39], attracts\nmore eyes in recent years. With the consideration of CAP [3]\nand PACELC [4], people develop a lot of consistency models,\nfrom weakest eventual consistency [9], timeline consistency\n[40] to causal consistency [41]. Instead of developing a new\nconsistency model or performance optimization for existing\nmodels, we discuss when and how the inconsistency occurs,\nand further measure its degree with a probabilistic model in\nthe context of RSMs.\nThere are several works [17,18 presenting bounded read\nstaleness from data versions, stale time and staleness proba-\nbility to evaluate the inconsistency of quorum like [15], anti-\nentropy [35] systems, where writes are committed by vector\n10\nclocks 16] with semantic reconciliation [5] in causal order as\nopposed to total order of RSMs. In this work, we focus on\nwrite inconsistency for RSMs, since read serializability can be\neasily guaranteed in total order to eliminate read staleness.\nSome previous works have been done on write inconsisten-\ncy. [19,20] provide techniques to make writes satisfying some\nconstraints, which use strong and weak consistency to ensure\nthe constraints are not violated. Write divergency of replicas\nare limited in [21,22]. For example, [21] provides some metrics\nsuch as numerical error and order error for data items, and\nthen presents a variety of algorithms for writes to guarantee\npredefined metrics. These write inconsistency models aim to\nimprove the performance in the absence of crash failures, but\nwe want to know how much inconsistency incurred by crash\nfailures a replication system may encounter, rather than confine\nwrites to some constraints, or bound the maximum deviation\nof a value from its newest version.\nIn the context of RSMs, in this work we quantify write\ninconsistency by the probability of write conflict while con-\nsidering crash failures. Furthermore, we calculate write latency\nand describe how to quantitatively make consistency and\nlatency tradeoff from the aspect of system benefit.\nIX. DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we provide several problems that should be\nnoted or considered in future work.\nA. Quorum Systems\nQuorum systems define sets of replicas W written to and\nR read from, which can be configured such as ONE\(W=1 W = [n/2] + 1 W = n other values. This is very like the three representative\nimplementations of RSMs, but they are essentially different.\nThe reason is that writes of quorum systems are ordered\ncausally and those of RSMs are totally ordered. Thus some\nconditions result in write conflict for RSMs but not for quorum\nsystems. For instance write duplication may occur when the\ncoordinator is falsely suspected. In contrast, it is meaningless\nto discuss write conflict for quorum systems because we can\nnot decide the original write and possible duplicated one are\nin the same order or not for the partial orders of writes. In\nthe practical quorum systems at present they mostly view the\nsecond write as a new write.\nHowever, our partial work can be useful for analyzing\nquorum systems. The formula on the expectation of laten-\ncy\(equation \(8 if\nreplacing W to d.\nB. Failure Mode and Failure Detection\nAs discussed in section II, our work is based on the\nassumption of non-Byzantine failures. If we enlarge failure\nmodes to Byzantine ones, our work should be made corre-\nsponding modification. In future work, we will consider this\nextension.\nFor non-Byzantine failures, we have modeled a common\nand popular heartbeat based but not adaptive and fast failure\ndetector Some optimized failure detectors [31,36] use syn-\nchronized clocks or adjust heartbeat intervals adaptively to\nachieve faster failure detection. This means that the expression\nThb2?Thb1 > To?Te in the formula of the probability of false\nsuspicion Pfs = Pr\(Thb2 ? Thb1 > To ? Te detectors.\nC. Coordinator Election and Failure Recovery\nWhile presenting the formula of write duplication, we have\nnoted that coordinator election and failure recovery [32] may\ninfluence its result.\nRSMs run coordinator election and failure recovery after\nsuspicions on coordinators for synchronizing the states of\nboth committed writes and historical records for replicas. This\nsynchronization may enlarge the range of historical records\nperceived by the new coordinator. Thus the historical records\nincurred by writes sent by the suspected coordinator may be\ncaught by the new coordinator during coordinator election and\nfailure recovery. This will avoid the reuse of sequence numbers\nand lower the probability of write duplication. Although we\ncan also provide a formula to measure the impact of coor-\ndinator election and failure recovery on write duplication it\ndepends on the specific processes of them, which can be very\ndifferent.\nD. Independence of Crash Failures and Message Delays\nAlthough we have released some assumptions in the com-\nputation of probability of write conflict and latency, we still\nassume that crash events of different nodes and message\ndelays between replicas are independent. In practice, they do\nnot always hold, since replica nodes and network links in\nmodern data centers usually share physical machines, routers\nand power devices and so on. However, the correlations among\nfailures and delays depend on the specific hardware and\nsoftware implementations. A reasonable solution is to acquire\nthe correlation factors among failures and delays by statistics\nfor established replication systems, and then append them to\nthe probability of crash failures and the message delays for\nmore accurate results.\nX. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we are concerned with providing a quan-\ntitative analysis of the 


relationship between consistency and\nlatency. Given that replicated state machines are widely used\nin modeling replication systems and there are several variants\nof RSM implementations, we first propose a generic model\ncalled RSM-d to give a unified description of major replication\nprotocols using RSMs. Second, on the basis of RSM-d, we\nbuild a probabilistic model for write conflicts that is one of the\nkey factors to cause inconsistency, and a probabilistic model\nfor characterizing latency as well. Third, we further define\na payoff model through combining the write conflict model\nand latency model from the perspective of a service provider.\nFinally, with Monte Carlo based simulation, we validate our\npresented results and show the effectiveness of our solution to\nmake tradeoff between consistency and latency to achieve the\nmaximum system benefit.\n11\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Richong Zhang and Yu\nTang for their discussions and feedback improved this work.\nThis work was supported partly by National Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China No. 61103031, No. 61272165 No. 2012AA011203 Author of National Excellent Doctoral\nDissertation of PR China, partly by Beijing Nova Program\nand partly by Program for New Century Excellent Talents in\nUniversity.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Amazon.com.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
