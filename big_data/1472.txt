Mining chains of relations Foto Afrati  National Technical University of Athens Athens Greece Gautam Das  University of Texas at Arlington Arlington TX USA Aristides Gionis Heikki Mannila Taneli Mielik ainen and Panayiotis Tsaparas Basic Research Unit HIIT University of Helsinki Helsinki Finland Abstract Traditional data mining applications consider the problem of mining a single relation between two attributes For example in a scientiìc bibliography database authors are related to papers and we may be interested in discovering association rules between authors However in real life we often have multiple attributes related though chains of 
relations For example authors write papers and papers concern one or more topics Mining such relational chains poses additional challenges In this paper we consider the following problem given a chain of two relations R 1  A P  and R 2  P T  we want to nd selectors for the objects in T such that the projected relation between A and P satisìes a speciìc property The motivation for our approach is that a given property might not hold on the whole dataset but it might hold when projecting the data on a selector set We discuss various algorithms and we examine the conditions under which the apriori technique can be used We experi 
mentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods 1 Introduction Traditional data mining applications extract interesting patterns from a single relation between two attributes e.g customers buying products document s containing words or genes expressed in tissues Multi-relational data mining has been considered an extension to the simple transactional data model However addressing the problem in the full generality proved to be a daunting task In this paper we restrict our attention to a speciìc case of chains of relations Our formulation captures many practical applications yet the problems are still easy to fo rmulate and feasible to solve As an example consider a dataset with attributes A authors P papers and T topics and relations R 1  A P  
 This work was done while the author was visiting Basic Research Unit HIIT University of Helsinki Helsinki Finland on authors writing papers and R 2  P T  on papers concerning topics An interesting pattern e.g authors a and b frequently write papers together might not be true for the whole dataset but it might be true for a speciìc topic t  Therefore it is meaningful to search for projections of the data on which interesting patterns occur We model datasets as graphs and patterns as graph properties Under this light the data-mining probl em is to nd nodes selectors to project the data on so that the induced subgraph the projected data satisìes a given property In the most general case of a database schema we assume 
n attributes A 1 A n and m relations R 1 R m on the attributes In this paper we focus on a simple scheme with three attributes A  B and C  and a chain of two relations R 1  A B  and R 2  B C   However the general ideas of our extension can be applied to more complex schemas We nd it convenient to work with the graph representation of schemas 1 we assume a graph G with three sets of nodes A  B 
and C corresponding to the three attributes and having one node for each value in the domain of the attribute The graph has two sets of edges E 1 connecting nodes in A and B and E 2 connecting nodes in B and C  Edges are deìned so that  a b   E 1 if and only if  a b   R 1 and  b c   E 2 if and only if  b c   R 2 We call such a graph a three-level graph  Examples of datasets 
that can be modeled with three-level graphs include AU THORS writing PAPERS about TOPICS  ACTORS playing in MOVIES belonging to GENRES and DOCUMENTS containing PARAGRAPHS containing WORDS  The general data-mining problem we consider is informally deìned as follows Cons ider the three-level graph G  A B C  E 1 E 2   Given a subset C   C of nodes from level C 
 one can induce a subgraph G  from G by taking B   B and A   A  such that every node in B  is connected to a node in C  with an edge in E 2  and every node 1 Graph representation works well as long as all relations have two attributes For relations with more than two attributes one would need to talk about hypergraphs Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDMê05 1550-4786/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


in A  is connected to a node in B  with an edge in E 1 Now the induced subgraph G  might satisfy a given property or it might not Example of properties are  G  contains a bipartite clique K s,t  and all nodes in A  have degree at least k  The intuition is that the induced subgraph corresponds to a projection of the data while the graph property corresponds to an interesting pattern Note that many traditional data-mining problems can be viewed as nding subgraphs with certain properties For instance nding itemsets of size s and support t in market-basket data corresponds to nding K s,t cliques For solving the general problem we provide conditions under which monotonicity properties hold and thus a levelwise method like apriori see e.g 8 can be used Man y of the problems we consider are NP-hard  many of them are hard instances of node removal problems 11  F or s uch problems we propose an Integer Programming IP formulation that can be used to solve medium-size instances by using existing IP solvers 2 Problem deìnition We start with attributes A  P and T  relations E 1  A P  and E 2  P T   and the corresponding three-level graph G   A P T  E 1 E 2   2 Let S  T be a subset of T Theset S acts as a selector over the sets P and A  Namely for some t  T wedeìne P t   p  P  p t   E 2  and A t   a  A   p  P t  s.t  a p   E 1  Thatis,thesets A t and P t are the subsets of nodes in P and A  respectively that are reachable from the node t  T  We can extend the deìnition to subsets P S and A S that are reachable from the set S  T  Extending the deìnition to sets requires to deìne the interpretation I of the selector S  Disjunctive Interpretation  D  the sets P S and A S are reachable from at least one node in S  P D S   t  T P t and A D S   t  T A t  Conjunctive Interpretation  C  the sets P S and A S are reachable from every node in S  P C S   t  T P t and A C S   t  T A t  Given the subsets A S and P S we can deìne the induced bipartite subgraph G S  A S P S  E S  where E S    a p   E 1  a  A S p  P S  Weuse G D S and G C S to denote the induced subgraph under disjunctive and conjunctive interpretation respectively 2 The attribute naming and the names of the problems and the graph properties we introduce later are inspired by the bibliography dataset  AU THORS  PAPERS  TOPICS  Now let  denote a graph property Given a three-level graph G  a property   and the interpretation I wedeìne the following problems M AX I  G   Find the maximal set S  T such that G I S satisìes   M IN I  G   Find the minimal set S  T such that G I S satisìes   A NY I  G   Find any set S  T such that G I S satisìes   Below we give a few examples of interesting properties Many more can be found in the full version of the paper In all cases we the graph G  A P T  E 1 E 2  is the input and G S  A S P S  E S   is the graph induced by the selector S  under either interpretation A UTHORITY  c  Given a node c  A  the graph G S satisìes A UTHORITY  c f c  A S and c has the maximum degree among all nodes in A S  C LIQUE  The graph G S satisìes C LIQUE if it is a bi-clique F REQUENCY  f  Given threshold value f  0  1 the graph G S satisìes the property F REQUENCY  f f G S contains a bipartite clique K s,f  P S  for some s 0 Alsointeresting is to enumerate all such cliques The intuition is that a bipartite clique K s,f  P S  implies a frequent itemset of size s with frequency threshold f  P ROGRAM C OMMITTEE  Z l m  We are given a set Z  T topics of a conference and values l and m Wesay that the induced subgraph B  X Y Z  E F  satisìes the property P ROGRAM C OMMITTEE  Z l m f  X   m  m members in the program committee and every node t  Z is connected to at least l nodes in X for each topic there are at least l experts in the committee Notice that this is the only example in which we reverse the roles of the attributes A and T  that is the input speciìes a subsets of nodes from T and the selector set is chosen from A However,thereis no real conceptual difference with the other examples we make only this exception t o be consistent with the semantics of the bibliography dataset 3 A characterization of monotonicity We now characterize graph properties for which standard level-wise methods can be used Given a three-level graph G and an interpretation I{C  D let S I   G I S  S  T  be the set of all possible induced bipartite graphs under interpretation I  Deìnition 1 A property  is monotone  anti-monotone n the set S I if for any selector set S  T such that G I S satisìes   we have that G I S  satisìes  for all S   S for all S   S  Monotonicity is used to prune the search space by not considering supersets of a selector set that does not satisfy a 2 Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDMê05 1550-4786/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


property 1  H ere we relate monotonicity with the c oncept of hereditary properties on graphs Deìnition 2 A property  is hereditary on the set G of all possible graphs with respect to node deletions if the following is true If G  V E  is a graph that satisìes  then for any V   V the induced subgraph G   V  E   of G We can prove the following We omit the proof due to lack of space Theorem 1 Any hereditary property is monotone on the set S D  and anti-monotone on the set S C  Theorem 1 has many interesting consequences e.g Proposition 1 The C LIQUE property is monotone on S D  4 Integer Programming formulations Computing the maximal or the minimal or any selector set in many cases is an NP-hard problem Here we give IP formulations for such problems We found that smalland medium-size instances of the problems we consider can be solved quite efìciently using an off-the-shelf IP solver 3 For the following we assume a disjunctive interpretation but similar formulations can be given for the conjunctive case Let G  A P T E 1 E 2  be a three-level graph For each element i  T wedeìneavariable t i  0  1   where t i 1 if the element i is selected and 0 otherwise Similarly for each element j  P we deìne a variable p j  0  1   First we require that if an element i  T is chosen then the set P T i   j  P  j i   E 2  is also chosen This condition is enforced by requiring that p j  t i for all j  P T i  Furthermore we require that for each j  P that is chosen at least one i  T is chosen such that  j i   E 2 Let T P j   i  T  j i   E 2  Wehavethat  i  T P j t i  p j  Finally for each element k  A wedeìneavariable a k  0  1  and impose similar constraints Let A P j   k   k j   E 1  and P A k   j  k j   E 1  Thenwehave a k  p j for all k  A P j  and  j  P A k p j  a k  3 In practice we solve IPs using the Mixed Integer Programming MIP solver lp solve obtained from http://groups.yahoo com/group/lp_solve We also deìne variable x k  that captures the degree of the node k  A in the subgraph induced by the selected nodes in T  i.e x k   j  P A k p j  For the properties we discussed in Section 2 we need to impose additional restrictions on the different variables A UTHORITY  c  We require x c  x k for all k  A  c   P ROGRAM C OMMITTEE  Z l m  Let A T i   k  A   j  P A k s.t  j i   E 2   We add the constraints  k  A a k  m and  k  A T i a k  l for all i  Z For this problem we need also the constraints a k  0  1  for all k  A since there are no topic set selection involved in the program Note also that we can neglect the authors outside the set  i  Z A T i  5 Algorithmic considerations The F REQUENCY problem We can show that nding frequent itemsets V with frequency threshold f in the threelevel graphs is equivalent to nding association rules S  V with conìdence threshold f  We omit the details The A UTHORITY problem For a single author c wesolve the authority problem using MIP The actual details depend on which interpretation we use In the conjunctive inte rpretation the subgraph induced by a topic set S contains a paper j  P iff S  T P j  Thus we can consider each paper j  P as a topic set T P j  Finding all topic sets with nonempty induced subgraph corresponds to mining frequent sets with frequency threshold f 1   P  in the database consisting the topic sets T P j and frequent set mining algorithms can be used e.g see 1  In the disjunctive inte rpretation the subgraph induced by thetopicset S contains a paper j  P iff S hits the paper i.e S  T P j 012    Hence it is sufìcient to compute the rankings only for those topic sets S that hit strictly more papers than any of their subsets It can be to shown that such sets of topics correspond to minimal hypergraph transversals and their subsets in the hypergraph  T  T P j  j  P   They can be generated efìciently by the level-wise approach The P ROGRAM C OMMITTEE problem For the P ROGRAM C OMMITTEE problem we use the MIP formulation sketched in Section 4 For an objective function we use the number of papers written by the program committee about the topics in the given set Z  6 Experiments We used information available on the Web to construct two real datasets with three-level structure For the datasets we used we found more interesting to experiment with the A UTHORITY and the P ROGRAM C OMMITTEE problem 3 Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDMê05 1550-4786/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

non-English movies movies with no genre as well as actors with secondary roles We have 45342 actors 71912 movies and 21 genres The A UTHORITY problem We run the level-wise algorithms described in Section 5 on our three datasets Given an author a  we deìne the collection of topic sets A  a   S  a is authority for topic set S  and A 0  a  the collection of minimal sets of A  a   or more precisely A 0  a   S A  a   T A  a   with T  S   For authors who are not authorities A  a  and A 0  a  are empty The author with the most papers in STOC is Wigderson 36 papers The size of A 0 and the average set size in A 0 for Wigderson is 37 and 2.8 respectively indicating that he tends to work in many different combinations of topics On the other hand Tarjan who is 4th in the overall ranking 25 papers has corresponding values 2 and 1.5 That is he is very focused on two topic sets data structures and discrete mathematics artiìcial intelligence These indicative results match our intuition about the authors We also searched for authorities in the JACM and IMDB datasets but we omit the results due to lack of space As a small example in the IMDB dataset we observed that Schwarzenegger is an authority of the combinations action fantasy and action sci but he is not an authority in any of those single genres The P ROGRAM C OMMITTEE problem Thetaskistoselect PC members for a subset of

The sixth row of Table 3 shows that only 0 2.53%, and 3.8% of the actual \221U2R\222 data points are detected correctly when minimum support is 1%, 0.5 and 0.05% respectively in the tests. R2L\222s cases are little better than \221U2R\222 data\222s but not optimistic yet The reason maybe is that there are too few U2R data and R2L data, which are 3 and 111 connections, or 0.01% and 0.22% respectively in training data, to produce good enough detection rules Table 4 gives overall accuracy of the classification and rule count of each test.

A hybrid system combines the synergistic features of different intelligent information discovery methods without complex computation. Contributions of this paper are listed as follows It provides a hybrid system of rough set theory and association rule discovery The hybrid system outperforms both rough set theory and association rule mining in the important respect of classification accuracies for all the five classes It proposes a new definition and recognition of association rule mining under the frame of rough set theory  References 1  Peddabachigari, S., Abraham, A., Grosan, C., Thomas J., Modeling Intrusion Detection System Using Hybrid Intelligent Systems, Journal of Network and Computer Applications Elsevier Science, 2005 2  W.

6. Conclusion In this paper a number of alternative rule ordering and case satisfaction strategies have been considered. Four established ordering strategies were examined. In addition the authors proposed a ?fth strategy, ACS, where more speci?c rules are given a higher precedence than less speci?c rules but using con?dence as the most signi?cant factor for tree pruning during the generation process The principal ?ndings of the evaluation are as follows 1 used in the experiments, \(2 mechanism works better than ìbest î in all the data sets tested, \(3 that a relatively high con?dence threshold is used \(a threshold of % is suggested 4 olds \(% to a ìbest ?rstî case satisfaction produced good results References 1] Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. \(1994 for mining association rules.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
