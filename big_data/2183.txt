However, we observe \nthat the native hash partitioning of MapReduce systems leads to \nfrequent uneven data distribution among reduce tasks. The \nuneven data distribution results in load imbalance among reduce \ntasks, and thus hampers the performance of MapReduce systems. \nMoreover, the heterogeneity among cluster nodes exacerbates the \nnegative effects of uneven data distribution due to varying \nperformance of the heterogeneous nodes. To address the above \nissues, in this paper, we propose a novel load balancing approach \nwith respect to the heterogeneity of clusters. This approach \nconsists of two components: \(1 based on history of \nreduce tasks, and \(2 HAP input data for reduce tasks based on the \nperformance estimation for reducers. We implement this \napproach as a plug-in of current MapReduce system. Experiment \nresults show that our approach improves the performance of nMapReduce jobs that run in heterogeneous systems, and incurs \nlittle overhead. \nKeywords—MapReduce;Load Balancing;heterogeneous \ncluster; heterogeneity-aware partitioning. \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nRecently, with the rapid development of the Internet, Cloud \nComputing has been proposed and studied extensively by both nacademia and industry. By using data centers, cloud computing \ncan \(1 resources on-demand, \nand \(2 1]-[2]. MapReduce, proposed by \nGoogle, is a computing model for parallel processing of big \ndata, especially data in the cloud. To be specific, it performs \ndistributed computation that processes massive amounts of data non clusters comprised of commodity servers [3]. \nIn the MapReduce execution paradigm, a job is broken into ntwo types of tasks: map tasks and reduce tasks. Map tasks are \nexecuted by mappers, and reduce tasks by reducers. Each \nmapper or reducer runs on a computing node. When a \nMapReduce job begins, each map task processes a partition of \nraw input data into key/values pairs. The key/values pairs are \ngrouped by their keys, and thus form several partitions. \nAfterwards, each reduce task takes several partitions as its \ninputs and processes the partitions in parallel. The execution \ntime of a MapReduce job is determined by the last finished \nreduce task. It is obvious that the execution time of a \nMapReduce job can be minimized if all reduce tasks finish at \nthe same time. However, usually reduce tasks cannot finish \neven in a short period due to the load unbalancing issues. To \nimprove the performance of MapReduce systems, those load \nunbalancing issues need to be addressed.  \nThere are two reasons for the load unbalancing of reduce \ntasks: \(1 hash partitioning of MapReduce systems, \nand \(2 unbalanced loads is the method that \npartitions the input key/values pairs among reducers. Usually, \nthe native partition method cannot allocate fair input data for \nreducers in MapReduce systems. For example, in Apache \nHadoop cluster [4], the execution of a MapReduce job is \nbroken into two phases: map phase and reduce phase [5]. In the \nmap phase, the job scheduler creates independent map tasks on \nindependent raw data partitions. The map tasks are assigned to \nmappers to be executed. The output of map tasks is key/value npairs. These output pairs are divided into many partitions \nthrough hashing. The hash function is as follows nRNkeyHashPN mod 1 nreducers. In the reduce phase, each partition is sent to a \ncorresponding reducer according to the value of its PN. \nTherefore, the amount of work for each reducer depends purely \non the static partitioning approach i.e. hashing distribution for many applications, for example, \nthe world population statistic application. For this application, \nif the hash function is based on the country name, the work \ndistribution among reducers would be significantly unbalanced. \nThis is because the reducers that process major countries \(e.g. \nChina involving key/value pairs would be assigned much \nmore work than the others. To illustrate the impact of hash-\nbased partitioning, we run a K-means MapReduce job on a \nvirtual Hadoop cluster. The input data size of the job is 6.3GB. \nTo rule out the impact of heterogeneity, each virtual machine is \nequipped with the same amount of resources \(i.e. 2GB main \nmemory and two virtual CPUs partitioning is adopted. As shown in Fig.1, the \nreducer r20 is assigned the largest amount of work. As a result, \n2013 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications & 2013 IEEE International Conference\non Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing\n978-0-7695-5088-6/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.209\n148031\nthe task of reducer r20 becomes the straggler task [6] \(i.e. the \nlast task that finishes

Performance of each node in MapReduce system can ndiffer due to multiple generations of hardware in non-\nvirtualized data centers or co-location of virtual machines \n\(VMs  the cluster nodes. For \nexample, the reduce task ra and reduce task rb process the same \namount of work; while the two tasks run on two heterogeneous \nnodes with different computing performance. This can result in ndifferent execution time of task ra and task rb. Consequently, \nthe straggler task can delay the whole job Fig.2 presents the \nresults of running the k-means application on a heterogeneous \nHadoop cluster \(refer to Section 6 for the description of the \nexperiment setup Fig. 2\(a The input \ndata size of reduce tasks varies from 951 KB \(task r7 task r5 b execution time of each reduce \ntask.

To address the load unbalancing issue in \nthe current MapReduce system, we propose a novel approach \nthat can \(1 2 work to reducers according to \ntheir processing capability. The contributions of this paper are \nas follows n• An approach to evaluate the performance of reducers is \nproposed. Using this approach, a performance model nfor reducers can be built based on history of reduce \ntasks. The model can be used to estimate the threshold nof work that can be allocated to each reduce task. \n• A heterogeneity-aware partitioning approach \(HAP nproposed. The HAP can adaptive reallocate the input \ndata to reduce tasks based on the estimated threshold nof work. Compared with existing hash-based \npartitioning, HAP can allocate work to reduce tasks \nwith respect to the processing capability of each node \nin heterogeneous MapReduce systems. By allocating \nless amount of work to the straggler task, the execution \ntime of the whole job can be reduced. \n• A prototype system is built by modifying the original \nHadoop system. However, the prototype system is \ntransparent to programmers Experiment results show \nthat our prototype system yields better performance \nand higher throughput than that of default Hadoop \nsystems. \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, \nwe introduce the background of our research. In section 3, we \nbriefly introduce load balance problem in heterogeneous nMapReduce Systems. In section 4, we introduce the load \nbalancing approach and heterogeneous-aware partitioning \nalgorithm. Section 5 describes the implementation of the load \nbalancer. In section 6, we present the evaluation. In section 7, \nwe discuss related work. Finally, we conclude the paper in \nsection 8 nII. BACKGROUND \nIn order to present our load balance method, it is necessary \nto review how to distribute the work to reducers in native \nMapReduce systems. In this section, we describe the \nmechanism of distributing work to reducers across a cluster \nand review the speculative execution that is an optimization to \novercome the difficulty of unbalanced loads of tasks in \nMapReduce systems. \nA. Work Distribution for Reducers \nA cluster based on MapReduce framework is composed of \ntwo node types: JobTracker node and TaskTracker nodes The \njobtracker, which runs on the JobTracker node, coordinates the \njob run. The tasktracker, which runs on TaskTracker node, is \nresponsible to run the map tasks or reduce tasks. Every Task-\ntracker has a fixed number of slots for map tasks and reduce \ntasks respectively. A slot for map/reduce tasks is called a nmapper/reducer. \nIn native MapReduce systems, like Hadoop, the output \ngenerated by each mapper is divided into partitions according \n1481\nto the partition function. Each partition is assigned to a reducer. \nAs illustrated in Fig.3, there are M mappers and N reducers and \noutput of mapper mi is divided into work distribution vector: \n 2 


fraction allocated to reducer rj. \n \nFig. 3 Work distribution in MapReduce system. \nB. Speculative Execution in MapReduce Systems \nAs mentioned in Sect.1, the reduce tasks cannot always \nfinish at the same time in heterogeneous MapReduce systems. \nWhen a job is running, MapReduce systems monitor each map \nor reduce task progress using progress score. According to the \nprogress score, a task is either identified to be slow-running \ntask \(straggler and launched by the task \nscheduler for speculative execution [5], if \(1 launched, and \(2 task and speculative task execute in parallel. Once \none of the two tasks finishes, the other task is killed In this \nway, the job execution time could be reduced. \nC.  Problem Description for Load Balancing in nHeterogeneous MapReduce Systems  \nMapReduce is a data-parallel computing model. The load \nof each task within a MapReduce job can be defined in terms \nof the data it processes. As to reduce tasks, the input data \(i.e nthe output of map tasks which processes \nmultiple partitions, are independent  one another. Therefore, \nthe load balancing can be realized by finding a fair data \ndistribution among reduce tasks in heterogeneous MapReduce \nsystems. In this section, we propose a computing capability \nmodel to evaluate the heterogeneity of MapReduce systems. \nBased on the computing capability of each computing node, we \nthen motivate a heterogeneity-aware work distribution model \nfor reducers.  \nIn heterogeneous MapReduce systems, individual \ncomputing nodes exhibit different computing capability. To \nprovide a fair distribution of work among reducers, it is \nnecessary to measure the computing capability of each node.  \nThe unit-time load Pi is the size of load that is allocated to a \ngiven node ni to be processed in a unit of time. For a given \nnode ni, the unit-time load can be expressed as: \n  i\ni\ni LT\nLP =                                        \(3 and T\(Li completed on a \nnode, and all tasks within the set S belong to the same \napplication. The computing capability of this node can be \ndefined as the mean value of the unit-time loads of the tasks \nwithin the set S. For a given node nj, let s denote the size of set \nS, ti denote the executed time of task tsi, and Li denote the size \nof input data processing by task tsi. Thus, the computing \ncapability of the node nj can be expressed as: \ns\nP\nnP\ns\ni i\nj\n\n=\n=\n1 n                                  \n\(4 can differ in \nheterogeneous MapReduce systems. To balance the load on \nreducers, each reducer should process different amount of work \naccording to its computing capability. Hence, we can build a \nwork distribution model for reducers as described as follows. \nWe first describe the notations used in this paper: \n1 of m map tasks:  \nMP = {map1, map2, map3, … , mapm} \n2 LFi1, LFi2, LFi3, … , LFiq } \n3 LFm } \n4 reducers: \nLR = {LR1, LR2, LR3, … , LRq } \n6 is executed: \nP = {P1, P2, P3, …, Pn } \nSuppose the computing capability of the standard node is \nPs and the node ni is P\(ni nheterogeneity factor HFi that can be obtained as: \ns\ni\ni P\nnPHF 5 that reducer ri runs on node ni. The time that \nreducer ri consumes to process the load of size LRi can be nexpressed as: \ni\ni\ni P\nLRT =\n  \n                                       \(6 denote the amount of work \nfractions allocated to reducer ri. If the size of all map task’s \noutput data is LM and the number of reducers is q, we \n1482\nhave\n\n=\n=\nq\nj\nLRLM\n1\nj . Thus the distributed threshold ?i can be ncalculated as: \nLM\nLRi\n=i?                                         \(7 allocated to reducer ri. \nTo meet the objective of minimizing the running time of all \nreduce tasks, the following optimization problem needs to be \nsolved: \nqi\niT\n??1\n max 8 n  n n n n n1\n1\nii\ni\nr\ni\nijiji\nq\nj\nijij\nii\nm\ni\nii\nLRlRlH\nqji\nnP\nLMT\nDCDCLFDLFCLFLFLF\nBABALFBLFALMLFLF ts\n?=\n???\n×\n=\n=??????=?\n=??????=?\n=\n=\n?\n??\n??\n??\n??\n\n\n \nWhere q is the number of reducers, A and B is a subset of \nthe set LFi respectively, C and D is a subset of the set LFij \nrespectively, H\(l partition function, Ri denotes \nreducer ri. It is obvious that the minimum of the job execution \ntime is determined by the reducer with the longest running \ntime. Fig.4 demonstrates an example of three reduce tasks nexecution time. As shown in Fig.4, the work of reducer ri is \ncomposed of four fractions: ?i1, ?i2, ?i3 and i4. The time \nconsumed to process these four load fractions by reducer ri is \nTi1, Ti2, Ti3 and Ti4. The execution time of the reduce phase is \ndetermined by reducer r3. If we can shorten the execution time \nof reducer r3 by reallocating part of its work to other reducers, \nthe job can be finished earlier. \nIn order to 


solve the problem \(8 algorithm, the output of map tasks can be \ndistributed to reducers fairly. \n \nFig.4 Impact of partition function on the performance of reduce task. \n \nIII. LOAD BALANCE APPROACH \nTo balance the load of each reducer, we need to know the \ncomputing capability of each node and to divide the output of \nmap tasks into more partitions than the native hash partitioning \nof MapReduce systems. In this section, we propose a fine grain \npartition method, called virtual partition, to re-partition the \noutput of map tasks. After that, we present a method to \nevaluate the computing capability of each heterogeneous node \nbased on history tasks. We present a heterogeneity-aware \npartition algorithm \(HAP the reducers load in three steps. \nFirst, it divides the divided key/value pairs to more clusters by \nusing the virtual partition technique. Second, it evaluates the \ncomputing capability of each computing node based on history \ntasks and achieves the performance parameters. Third, it uses \nHAP algorithm to assign work to reducers based on the \nperformance parameters of computing nodes. The details of our \nload balance method are described as follows. \nA. Virtual Partition \nThe method used to partition the map output can affect the \nload balance of reduce tasks. The native method in MapReduce \nsystems \(e.g. Hadoop pairs to \nclusters, and the number of the clusters is equal to the number \nof the reducers. This partitioning method can lead to unfair \nwork distribution among reduce tasks. Hence, we adopt the \nconsistent hashing technique [8] to provide fair work \ndistribution. According to the consistent hashing technique, we \ndefine virtual partition. Virtual partitions are replicas of each \nreal partition. By creating a number of virtual partitions, we \ncan divide the output of all map tasks into more partitions. \nHence, the size of each virtual partition becomes smaller than \nbefore. And it’s more likely to balance the load among all \nreducers with smaller partitions. We state the property of \nvirtual partition and present a virtual partition function as nfollows. \nLet ? denote the partition adjustment parameter, and rs \ndenote the number of reducers. The number of virtual partitions \nv can be calculated as follows: \n?×= rsv                                         \(9 nAccording to the number of virtual partitions, we modify \nthe native partition function. Suppose keyi is a key/value pair of \nthe output of mapper mi. Keyi will be allocated to the virtual \npartition vpi and vpi is calculated as follows: \n mod vkeyHashvp ii =                     \(10 virtual partitioning. As \nfor the first step, these key/value pairs from map tasks output \nare divided into virtual partitions according to virtual partition \nfunction. Afterwards, these virtual partitions are assigned to \ndifferent reducers according to HAP. \n \nFig.5 Virtual partitioning. \n1483\nB. Performance Evaluation for Computing Node \nThe performance of computing nodes can impact work \ndistribution among reducers. To approximate the computing \ncapability of each computing node, we can analyze the history \ntasks and characterize the performance information. In \nMapReduce systems, system log contains information about \nthe execution of jobs and tasks. Our evaluation method focuses \non the follows performance information: \n• The type of job and its tasks \(map or reduce task ntask. \n• The size of input or output data for each job or task. \n• The total numbers of jobs run on the clusters and tasks \non each node. \nFor different applications, the computing capability of each \nnode is different. There may be many reducers running on the \nsame computing node. Hence, for the same application, we first \nevaluate the performance of each reducer. We then calculate \nthe average value of all reducers on the same computing node. \nThis average value is denoted as the computing capability of \nthe node. The method used to evaluate the performance of each \nreducer is described as follows. \nFor computing node ni and job Jj, every completed task is \ndenoted by the tuple  \(ni, a\(Jj Jj reflects the type of job Ji and c reflects the task \ntype. Let set Ri = {r1, r2, r3,…, rw} denote w reducers on node ni \nand set JOB\(ni, a\(J1 application type a\(J1 nreduce tasks that belong to job JP.

HAP Algorithm \nAs described in Sec.3.2, the load balance problem is \nformulated as an optimization problem problem \(8 8 set partition problem subject to \nideal task completion time. We then design a new algorithm \ncalled HAP to balance load among reducers.  \nThe execution time of a MapReduce job is determined by \nthe last finished 


reduce task. In order to reduce the execution \ntime of a MapReduce job, a better method is to allocate fair nwork to reducers. Hence we formulate the load balance \nproblem as a minimizing the completed time of all reducer \ntasks \(problem \(8 all reduce tasks finish at \nthe same time. In this case, the ideal amount of work for each \nreducer can be approximated. In MapReduce systems, the work \nallocated to reducers is determined by partition function Recall \nfrom Sec.4.1, in order to win the opportunity for balancing the \nload on reducers, we create more partitions by using virtual \npartition technique. Therefore, the load balance problem is a \nquestion of how to distribute virtual partitions in an ideal \nproportion to reducers. This problem is a set partition problem n\(SPP  1, ?2, ?3, … ,?r}, where ?q is the \ndistributed threshold of qth reducer. The object to balance load \namong reducers is to find a partition solution of set L. This \npartition problem PA will be as \n{ }rPAPAPAPAPA 321=                   \(13 jii\nji\nLPA\nriLPASUM\nrjiPAPAts\n??\n=\n=\n??××<\n???=?\n\n1\n1\n  n n??\n?\n \n \nWhere PAi is a subset of set L SUM\(PAi value. \nTo solve this problem, we present HAP algorithm as shown \nin Algorithm 1. As described in Sec.4.2, the computing \ncapability of each node can be evaluated firstly based on \nhistory tasks. If each computing node is configured with only \none reducer, the performance of each reducer can be calculated \nby Eq.\(11 Eq.\(12 P\(n1 n2 n3 nr n{L1, L2, L3, ? Lp}, where Li is the size of ith virtual partition. \nLet the total size of all virtual partitions is TS. The procedure of \nHAP is consisted of following steps. \nStep.1. Approximate the distributed threshold of each \nreducer. In this step, the amount of work distributed to each \nreducer is approximated as the threshold for HAP. For reducer \nri, supposed that the reduce task t\(ri nexecution time of reduce task t\(ri t\(ri calculated by ?i= f\(t\(ri ri t\(ri t\(rk calculated, where 1?i?k?r and r is the number \nof all reducers in the clusters. By this step, the set ?={?1 2, \n?3, … ?r} is obtained. \n1484\nStep.2. Allocate all virtual partitions to different reducers \naccording to the set ?. In this step, we use an approximate bin \npacking solution to allocate virtual partitions Initially, a queue \ncalled rq is built. The queue rq contains all reducers in the \ncluster. The queue rq is sorted in descending order by \ndistributed threshold. The largest size virtual partition Ll in set \nL is allocated to the reducer rh on the head of rq. Then, the \navailable capability ci for reducer rh can be calculated by TS?\n?1-Ll. After that, the queue rq will be sorted in descending \norder by available capability ratio cr. For reducer ri, the \navailable capability ratio cri can be calculated \nby i\ni\ni TS\nccr\n??= . For the remainder of virtual partitions, the \nlargest size virtual partition will be allocated to the reducer \nwith the maximum value of cr. The available capability ratio cr \nwill be re-calculated after each allocation. \n nAlgorithm 1?HAP Algorithm \nInput: L: the set of virtual partition size \n       r: the number of reducers \nTS the sum of all virtual partition size \n?: the overload threshold \nP: the set of computing capability nOutput?PA: the list of balanced virtual partition \n1   decendingSort\(L P foreach ?i ?  do \n4      CPL ??i ?

IMPLEMENTATION \nIn this section, we present the implementation of a load \nbalance framework which can estimate the performance of \nreducers based on the history of reduce tasks, and allocate work \nto reduce tasks according to the performance of reducers.  \nTo implement the load balance framework, we build a load \nbalancer on top of Hadoop-0.21.0. As depicted in Fig. 6, the \nload balancer runs on every slave node. It is composed of four \ncomponents: virtual partition \(VP LA MRLA and metadata service \(MS output data of \nmap tasks into partitions. We modified the core MapTask class \nin Hadoop. In native Hadoop the output of map tasks is \ndivided into partitions. The number of partitions equals the \nnumber of reducers However, in our balancer, the output of \nmap tasks is divided into virtual partition according to the \nvirtual function as shown in Eq.\(10 nsubmitted. \nThe metadata service component, which is a runtime \nprocess, is responsible for collecting metadata information \(e.g. \nthe size of each virtual partition vp completed. The metadata service component also \nprovides metadata service for LA component such as querying nthe size of each virtual partition. MS component is \nimplemented by extending the core ShuffleScheduler class 


in \nHadoop. \nThe performance evaluation component is designed to \nestimate the performance of each reducer based on history of \nreduce tasks. We implement a log analysis tool, called MRLA, \nto analyze the reduce tasks of the jobs that have been executed \nby a cluster during a period of time. Based on the above \nanalysis, MRLA also evaluate the computing capability of each \nreducer according to the approach described in Sec.4.2. \nThe load allocation component provides the following two \nfunctions: 1 from MS \ncomponent and performance parameters from MRLA \(i.e. \ncomputing capability of each reducer allocating work to \nreducer by implementing the HAP algorithm.  \nThe process of load balancing is given in the following.  \nWhen a MapReduce job is submitted to the JobTracker, the \njob is split into a set of map tasks and reduce tasks. If there are \navailable TaskTrackers in the cluster, JobTracker allocate tasks \nto the TaskTrackers for running. Firstly, each mapper reads the \nsplit-blocks from Hadoop distributed file system HDFS balancer. And the output \nkey/value pairs of map function are divided into virtual \npartitions by virtual partition function. After the process of all \nvirtual partitions is completed, the VP can be response to query nfrom MS component. And the metadata of virtual partition \nfrom each mapper is transmitted to MS component. In MS \ncomponent, all metadata of virtual partition is merged into a set  \n1485\n     \n \n\(a b c  virtual partition according to keys. Then LA component is \nlaunched by load balancer. In LA component, the HAP nalgorithm is implemented. Before HAP algorithm executed, the \nmerged metadata of virtual partition is transmitted from MS \ncomponent to LA component. At the same time the \nperformance parameters of computing nodes, which are \nevaluated by MRLA tool, is transmitted to LA component as \nthe input of HAP algorithm. By HAP algorithm, the balanced \npartition list PA, as described in Algorithm 1, is obtained. Then \neach reducer fetches map tasks output from mappers according \nto the balanced partition list PA. After that, reducers invoke the \nreduce function to process their input key/value pairs. And \nfinally, when all reduce tasks completed, the output of tasks is \nwritten into HDFS. \nV. EVALUATION \nIn order to evaluate the performance and benefits of our \nLoad Balancer, we carry out the experiments on a virtualized \ncluster. We use Xen [10 virtualization software to build the \nheterogeneous virtualize environments. The test bed is \ncomposed of three Inspur Yingxin NF5240M3 Servers, each of \nwhich is equipped with 16 GB of memory, a single 250 GB \nSATA driver and four Intel\(R R Linux nkernel 2.6.18 machine is \ngiven different amounts of memory and different number of \nprocessors.

We get the Ranked-inverted-\nindex workload from Purdue MapReduce Benchmarks Suite, \nand get its input from the free dataset [12]. The size of dataset \nis 16.6 GB. \nTo evaluate the performance of load balance method, we \nconsider the following metric: job execution time, elapsed time \nof reduce tasks, and the overhead of load balancing. In our \nevaluation, we use the following configuration parameters. The \nHDFS block size is set to 64 MB by default, and each virtual \nnode is configured with two map task slots and one reduce task \nslot, respectively. \nA. Performance Comparison of Different partition nAdjustment Parameter \nFor load balancer, the number of virtual partitions may \nsignificantly affect the performance of HAP algorithm. When \nthe number of virtual partitions is small, the load balancer can \nfetch the metadata information of each virtual partition more \nefficient; however less virtual partitions can lead to more \nunbalanced work distribution among reducers. Eq. \(9 


is determined by the \npartition parameter ? and the number of reduce task slots rs. \nHowever, rs is a constant value related to the initial \nconfiguration of the cluster. In this subsection, we conduct a set \nof experiments to demonstrate the impact of the partition \nadjustment parameter on the performance of load balancer. We \nrun the Ranked-Inverted-Index, CloudBurst and Sort \napplication separately. The value of ? is varied from 1 to 20. \nThe experiment results are shown in Fig. 7. \n1486\nAs shown in Fig.7 \(a Ranked-Inverted-Index, load \nbalanced jobs run 1.03-1.1x faster than unbalanced jobs. For \nCloudBurst, the jobs execution time improvement of load \nbalancer over the native Hadoop is 7% in the worst case \(? =1 16% in the best case \(? =16 nperformance improvement in the best situation \(? =4 1 demonstrate that, compared with native \nHadoop, the load balancer leads to a significant execution time nreduction, and the performance is stable when value of ? is \nvaried from 2 to 20. \nFig. 7 shows that the balanced job marginally outperforms \nthe unbalanced job when the partition adjustment parameter ? \nis set to be 1. In this case, the number of virtual partition used \nin load balancer is equal to the number of partition in native \nHadoop; however, by using HAP algorithm, we can allocate \nthe largest partition to most powerful computing node. Hence, \nstraggler task’s execution time can be shortened. As increasing \nof the partition adjustment parameter of HAP, work \ndistribution among reducers becomes more balanced. However, \nthe performance cannot always improve with the increase of \nthe partition adjustment parameter. This is because of noverhead, which is incurred by fetching metadata of virtual \npartitions and transferring the map outputs to the reducers, \nincreases as inputs become larger. Without loss of generality, \nthe partition adjustment parameter is set to 12 in the following \nexperiments.  \nB.  Load Balancer Performance \nAs pointed out in Sec.2.2, in order to reduce job execution \nfor straggler tasks, the speculative execution is turned on in nnative Hadoop. However this is a waste of cluster resources, as \nthe speculative task races with straggler task and takes up a \ntask slot. Hence, in some cases \(i.e. Facebook tasks is disabled [7]. Our load balancer \ndisables the speculation for reduce tasks too. In this subsection nwe compare the load balancer with native Hadoop with \nspeculative execution for reduce tasks enabled and disabled \nrespectively. For each setting, we test the performance of load \nbalancer with four applications i.e. cloudburst, sort, Ranked-\nInverted-Index and K-means For the first three applications, the number \nof virtual partitions is set to 12 as mentioned in section 5.1 For \nK-means, the number of reduce tasks is related to the number \nof clusters k. If the number of reduce slots rs is more than k, the \nnumber of idle reduce slots will be rs – k. To demonstrate the \nbenefit of load balance algorithm for this situation, in our \nexperiment the partition adjustment parameter ? is set to 1 and nthe number of clusters k is set to 15. \nFig.8 shows the normalized job execution time when \nrunning different applications. For Ranked-Inverted-Index, \nload balanced jobs exhibit 8% performance improvement \ncompared with native Hadoop and 33% compared with no \nspeculation. For k-means, the load balancer resulted in up to \n6.6 performance improvement compared with native hadoop \nand 13.8% compared with Hadoop with reduce task speculative \nexecution disabled. For cloudburst, the peroformance \nimprovements of load balancer compared with native and no \nspeculation are 13% and 13.8% respectively. For sort, load \nbalance resulted in up to 16.2% and 18.5% faster job execution \ntime than native Hadoop and native Hadoop with no \nspeculation respectively. \n nFig.8 Job execution time for load balancer against native Hadoop and no \nspeculation. \nAs clearly shown in Fig.8, when the reduce task speculative \nexecution disabled, it takes much longer time to execute the job nthan native Hadoop and no speculation. The reason is that each \nnode exhibits different computing capability in heterogeneous \nMapReduce systems. The reduce task, which is allocated to the \nslowest node, becomes the straggler that delay the completion \nof the whole job. In contrast, when the reduce task speculative nexecution enabled, the task which is slower than expected is \ndetected, and a speculative task is launched Although \nspeculative task may shorten the execution time of the whole \njob, it can be launched only after all normal tasks have been \nlaunched and some idle reduce slots are available. Whatever \nthe straggler task finishes early or the speculative task finishes \nfirst, two reduce task slots are taken to process the same work. \nHence, it can be a waste of cluster resources. Unlike the \nspeculation approach, the speculative execution for reduce \ntasks is disabled in our load balancer. However, the load \nbalancer can allocate work to reducers fairly, thus straggler \ntasks are avoided essentially and speculation is not needed. As \na result, by using load balancer, job execution time can be \nminimized, and the utilization of cluster resources is improved. \nC.  Balancing Overhead \nIn this subsection, we measure the balancing overhead and \nwith the execution time breakdown of reduce tasks. We \ncompare the load balancer based on HAP algorithm \(HAP native Hadoop \(NS 


Ranked-Inverted-Index, \nSort and K-means separately. For K-means, the number of \nreduce task is determined by the number of clusters k. In order \nto evaluate performance of the load balancer when the number \nof reduce tasks is less than the number of reducer task slots rs, \nwe modify the K-means algorithm and parameter k is to 15. \nInitially the number of reduce tasks is set to be 21 manually for \nabove three applications. The results demonstrate that, \ncompared with no speculation, the execution time of reduce \ntask is reduced and the overhead incurred by HAP algorithm is \nvery small, as shown in Fig. 9. \nFig. 9\(a breakdown of reduce \ntasks of Ranked-Inverted-Index application. When the \napplication runs in native Hadoop system with the speculative \n1487\n \n\(a b c of reduce tasks \nexecution of reduce tasks is disabled, the reduce task assigned \nto node g15 becomes the straggler task who completes in 1350 \nseconds. With HAP algorithm, the straggler task assigned to \nnode g01 completes only in 1057 seconds. In this case, load \nbalanced reduce tasks run 21.8% faster than unbalanced tasks. \nFig. 9\(b fifteen partitions \nbecause the number of clusters k is to 15 in the beginning. Each \npartition is sent to one reducer. The five tasks of all reduce \ntasks complete in short time. When the load balance feature is ndisabled, the straggler task assigned to node g05 completes in \n735 seconds. With load balancer enabled, the execution of \nstraggler task assigned to node g01 drops to 490 seconds. For \ncloudburst, load balance results in 11.8% performance \nimprovement for reduce tasks, as shown in Fig. 9\(c load balancer disabled, \nthe ratio of the straggler task execution time to the first finished \ntask execution time is 2.52, however only 1.35 with the load \nbalancer enabled, as shown in Fig. 9\(a nload balancer disabled, the ratio of the straggler task execution \ntime to the first finished task execution time is 1.41, however \nonly 1.068 with the load balancer enabled, as shown in Fig. \n9\(c demonstrates that, the execution time of \nstraggler tasks reduces dramatically because of the fairly work ndistribution by HAP algorithm, especially when the size of \nshuffling data is not large. For example, for the CloudBurst \napplication, the average size of input data of each reducer is 83 \nMB, and response time difference between fastest reduce task \nand slowest reduce task is only 6.8%, as shown in Fig. 9\(c nTherefore, it is fair to say that load balancer improves the \nperformance of MapReduce jobs and the utilization ratio of \ncluster resource. \nVI.  RELATED WORK \nData skew is an important problem because it can cause the \nunbalanced workloads in parallel processing system. There are \nmany effective solutions to this problem. The current \nMapReduce system implementation has overlooked this \nproblem. However, there are some studies has been carried out \nby many organizations and agencies. \nIbrahim et al. propose the LEEN algorithm to solve the \ninput data skew of reduce tasks. LEEN calculates statistics for \nthe global key/value pairs during Map task execution. All \nbuffered intermediate keys are partitioned by their frequencies \nand the fairness of the expected data distribution after the \nshuffle phase [17]. However, the LEEN assumes that the noutput load of Map function is equal; however, it is usually not \nequal. On the other word, this method does not split large \ninputs of reduce task into small ones that can lead to \nunbalanced work distribution among reduce tasks. Mohammad \net al. [18] propose the LARTS algorithm which combines the \ndata locality with Reduce schedule policy. When a free node \nrequests a reduce task from the master node, the LARTS \njudges whether the node holds the largest partition for the \nrequested task. If not, the LARTS could not assign the reduce \ntask to the node and wait the suitable requirement of computing \n1488\nnode. This approach can reduce the amounts of data transferred \nbetween nodes, but it can’t balance the input load of reducers. \nGufler et al. [19] propose a system called TopCluster that \naddress the unbalance work distribution issues by capturing \ndata skew in MapReduce system. They gather statistics from \nthe mappers and approximate the global data distribution nYongChul Kwon et al. [20] propose a system called SkewTune \nto mitigate skew in MapReduce application. They perform a \ndynamic load balancing algorithm to handling the \ncomputational skew during tasks running. This method requires \nmore data movement during tasks execution, which can add the \noverhead of network traffic. In our method, the amounts of data \nmovement are reduced, because the work for straggler task is \ndistributed evenly into reducers based on the computing \ncapability of each node before reduce tasks beginning. Smriti R nRamakrishnan et al. [21] proposed a static load balancing \nalgorithm to mitigate the skew data in MapReduce system. \nThis solution is based on the statistical modeling of the reducer \nwork distribution, and a progressive sampling technique is used \nto determine the sample size. YongChul Kwon et al. [22] \npropose SkewReduce that statically optimizes the data \npartitioning according to user-defined cost function. Both nmethods require user interaction or user knowledge of statistics \nor sampling. On the contrary, our heterogeneous-aware load \ndistribution mode does not require user interaction, and the \ncomputing capability evaluation is based on the MRLA tool \nthat can automatically analyze the history job and tasks logs 


nFinally, when the reduce keys follow the Zipfian \ndistribution, Lin et al. [6] analyze the impact of partition skew \nto performance of MapReduce systems. Their approach splits \nthe disproportionately large records into smaller ones to \nbalance the load. However this solution is aim to the data skew \nissue in map phase.  \nVII.  CONCLUSION \nCurrent MapReduce frameworks perform poorly on \nheterogeneous clusters. One of the key reasons is the load \nimbalance among reduce tasks. We identify the key causes of \nload imbalance among reduce tasks in heterogeneous \nMapReduce clusters as follow: \(1 systems, and \(2 nload balance approach with respect to the heterogeneity of \nclusters. We implemented the proposed load balance approach \nin the Hadoop framework. The experiment results show that \nour approach achieves an average speed-up of 11% over native \nHadoop in a cluster with 22 virtual machines. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work is supported by National High-Tech Research \nand Development Plan of China under the grant \nNo.2011AA01A204 2012AA01A306, National Key \nTechnology R&D Program under grant No.2011BAH04B03, \nNational Natural Science Foundation of China under grant \nNO.61202041 and Fundamental Research Funds for the \nCentral Universities under grant NO.08142007. \nREFERENCES \n[1] M.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
