intelligence, but their learning effects is low-level and can not attain the standard of national curriculum. Most of LD students have the writing disabilities 1 Compared with the normal students, students with writing disabilities usually have difficulties in composition planning, translation processing and composition modifying. Meanwhile, students with writing disabilities always have fears of writing and lack of the interest of it Writing disabilities have difficulties in both low-level and high-level modification. Then how to solve this problem? With 
the development of multimedia technology since the 1990s overseas researchers, especially the American, have got great success in supporting the writing disabled children by multimedia technologies 2][3 Among them, the voice recognition technology and the concept mapping strategy are the quite effective ones. The voice recognition technology supports their writing by oral composition, in order to improve the low-level problem of writing 4 And the concept mapping makes the visualized conception of children to overcome the high-level problem of writing 
5  This paper tries to research the effective role of the voice recognition and concept map strategy played to support the writing disable children in Chinese environment. This paper supposes that \(1\pported by voice recognition technology the oral composition could enhance their writing abilities. \(2 Concept mapping strategy could also make a great effort in this aspect. \(3\The combination of both the concept map strategy and the voice recognition is more effective than using only one of them for the writing disable students to improve their composition II  Method A.

As to the whole quality measurement of the composition, we adopt the qualitative method   III  Results and Analysis A.   Effectiveness analysis fo r different composition teaching methods affects com position hardness index Table 1 is the result that average statistical results in hardness index written in four groups of students’ two articles obviously, hardness index value of each group’s composition is more than control group’s. They make nonparametric inspection by using Mann-Whitney U method. The result is showed in Table 2       As can be seen from Table 2, all the total words and sentences number of voice group’s writing at 0.01 levels achieves significant differences, and the qualifier number doesn’t achieve significant differences. The total words number of Concept Map group’s writing at 0.01 levels achieves significant differences, and the sentences and qualifier number at 0.05 levels achieve significant differences The total words, sentences and qualifier number achieve significant differences at 0.01levels in the writing under the interaction between Voice and concept map Table 1 the Quality of Composition Hardness Index Statistical Data Variables G1\(Voice Group G2 \(Concept Map Group G3\(Interaction Group G4\(Control Group Total Words Sentence Amount Modifier Amount Total Words Sentence Amount Modifier Amount Total Words Sentence Amount Modifier Amount Total Words Sentence Amount Modifier Amount M 322 13 7.17 348 11.5 8.5 335 12.67 10.17 186 8.17 4.51 SD 38.12 2.53 1.94 59.08 1.87 2.42 47.9 2.80 2.64 43.3 2.14 2.51 


 B 002 Effect Analysis for Different composition teaching methods affects composition quality index Table 3 is the quality index value of two whole articles from which we can see that each group’s quality index value of composition is more than control group’s. The result of Mann-Whitney U is showed in the Table 4. From Table 4, the students’ composition in voice group has significant difference at 0.01 levels in the quality index of thought, details, beginning and ending, arrangement paragraph and transition and linkage except no significant difference in material selection. The students’ composition in concept map group respectively achieves significant differences at 0.01 levels except at 0.05 levels achieving significant difference in transition and linkage The composition under the interaction between Voice recognition and concept map all achieve significant difference at 0.01 levels in six indexes For above Manna-Whitney U is made inspection of hardness and quality index in each group, result of which achieves significant differences  IV  Problem Discussions The results show that composition level of the students with writing disabilities under technology supporting obtains significant improvement in most of quality and hardness index which is similar to the experimental result in English environment made by Levy & Ransdell and Janet M. Sturm etc   A 002 The analysis of quality change s of oral composition under the condition of voice recognition technology Oral composition styles under the condition of voice recognition make the result that of which composition achieves significant difference in hardness index. It is because that under the support of Chinese voice recognition system, the result dictated by writer is directly showed on the screen, which help students both overcome disabilities brought by the request of writing machinery and have no losing of advantage of external representation of written composition, thus make the students avoid the overload of recognition loading and whose thought be more free, imagination be more plentiful, words and expressions be more abundant ,which is the result of advantage tactics by borrowing mutually between oral and written language, synchronously, the oral rehearsal tactics in the process of voice recognition enable students to have the increasingly ability of  aiming to a certain subject ,which is one reason of causing the increasing length of composition. The plan under the condition of voice recognition and oral composition style make the details, beginning and ending transition and linkage and thought in the composition of students with writing disabilities achieve significant difference It is because that writing outline produced by brains storm enable students to write more systematical composition and pay more attention to the beginning and ending of writing and the problem of transition and linkage. On the other hand, oral language requests boundary diction, boundary expression short process that  thought is converted into language and disconnected ‘mood paragraph of oral composition under the condition of voice recognition’, which resulted in that modifier and material selection of oral composition under the condition of voice recognition have no significant difference B 002 The analysis of quality c hanges of composition under the condition of concept map technology The key function of Concept map as a tactics supporting the students with writing disabilities is to support writing Table 4 Mann-Whitney U Variables Voice Group W             P Concept Map Group W                   P Interaction Group W                P Material Selection 27 0.60 21 0.003 21 0.003 Thought  23.5 0.01 21 0.003 21 0.004 Details  23 0.009 21 0.004 21 0.004 Beginning Ending 22 0.006 21 0.004 21 0.003 Arrangement Paragraph 27 0.005 21 0.004 21 0.004 Transition 21 0003 23 5 0011 21 0003 Table 3 Score Table of Composition Quality Index Variables G1\(Voice Group G2 \(Concept Map Group Material Selection Thought Details Beginning Ending Arrangement Paragraph Transition Linkage Material Selection Thought Details Beginning Ending Arrangement Paragraph Transition Linkage M 3.42 3.64 3.33 3.67 3.46 3.63 3.75 3.79 3.63 3.75 3.79 3.63 SD 0.38 0.25 0.39 0.30 0.40 0.21 0.32 0.25 0.31 0.22 0.25 0.38 Variables G3\(Interaction Group G4\(Control Group Material Selection Thought Details Beginning Ending Arrangement Paragraph Transition Linkage Material Selection Thought Details Beginning Ending Arrangement Paragraph Transition Linkage M 3.79 3.75 3.67 3.71 3.75 3.67 3.04 2.92 2.67 3.00 2.96 2.96 SD 0.25 0.22 0.20 0.25 0.22 0.20 0.19 0.26 0.30 0.22 0.29 0.19 Table 2 Mann-Whitney U Variables Voice Group  W      P Concept Map Group W        P Interaction Group W        P Total Words 21 0.004 21 0.004 21 0.004 Sentences Amount 23 0.010 25 0.029 23 0.010 Modifier Amount 29 0.104 26 0.035 21 0.004 


conception procedures. Compositio n style under the support of concept map, enable students with writing disabilities to consciously distinguish simultaneity between high level and low level machining. The other is visual characterization of writing plan, which enable students with writing disabilities to reduce deficiency of information machining tactics in the working memory. It is enough to explain the reason that hardness index of composition under the support of concept map achieves significant improvement Concept map make people with writing disabilities visualize knowledge structure of special subject construction stimulating previous knowledge to writing by assisting writer to see words, concept and relation, be a scaffold of students memory in each stage in writing process. Concept map allows students through the mouse moving idea to increase or delete easily concept or thought and to colorize concept relation. The writing environment made up of picture node and concept relation in the concept map has obviously decreased recognition resource consumption of students with writing disabilities, making their association be more plentiful description be more concrete, whole length of composition be obviously enhancive, application of modifier words and conjunction be obviously increasing, sentence be much longer which is the main reason that using writing style under the support of concept map leads to the change of writing hardness index C The Analysis on the quality of compositions under both the interaction of concept map and voice recognition Theoretically, voice recognition can avoid the low-level difficulties of writing disable students, while the concept map can erase the high-level difficulties of them. If voice recognition and concept map can be combined to support writing disable students, the level of their writing could be further improved. But the result of the research shows that although the quality of compositions can be improved when using these two technologies at the same time, further analysis reveals that composition under the  support of two technologies has little differences from that under the support of single technology. The reasons are as the following: In respect that the voice recognition not only can avoid the low-level difficulties, but also has the support of visual text, and concept map strategy owns the multimedia environment, therefore either of the two technologies can effectively support the writing disable students with their composition V  Conclusion After the experimental investigation, we have come to a conclusion that: \(1\pported by voice recognition technology the oral composition could enhance the content of the composition and improves its quality obviously in Chinese Environment. \(2\oncept map strategy could also make a big effort in these aspects. \(3\he way of composition combined by the voice recognition and concept map strategy has no more effective than using one of them separately to improve the composition of the writing disable students. Consequently there’s no need to put these tw o technologies into use at the same time  1 acA r t h u r C A F e rr e t ti R P O k o l o C M , e t  al T e chno l o gy appl ica t i o ns  for students with literacy problems: A critical review.

key parameters for root cause analysis of anomalies This study emphasizes that the defined baseline can be used to characterize a new computer model This will allow us to characterize a new notebook computer regardless of the model and reduce the time for analysis In this study PPA and MD were independently used to identify the similarity of new observations to healthy data PPA performed this analysis in a reduced dimension based on an optimization criterion maximum variance It was also found that PPA can identify the faulty parameters based on the data whereas MD requires an understanding of the system The strength of PPA lies in the ability to decompose the signal and extract additional information not originally available used to identify faults in the system PPA overcomes masking effects when working with highly correlated data The strength of the MD method is that it preserves all the information available because it does not reduce the original dimensionality of the data The drawbacks of using just the MD method are that it cannot be used directly for fault identification and it is susceptible to masking effects With the MD results and our understanding of the system functionality four critical parameters were empirically identified the fan speed and the three temperature components CPU temperature motherboard temperature and videocard temperature In parallel in the PPA approach the principal component space also identified the fan speed as the most dominant and from the residual principal component space three temperature parameters were identified to be dominant mathematically confirming the earlier empirical conclusion The cross-validated result shows that these two algorithms can be used for fault detection and isolation The MD method can be used for quick fault detection at a system level and fault isolation can be made if related fault to MD signatures are available PPA can also be used when system faults are not known and where critical parameters need to be identified ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work is sponsored by the members of the CALCE Prognostics and Health Management Consortium at the University of Maryland College Park REFERENCES 1 N Vichare P Rodgers V Eveloy and M Pecht Environment and Usage Monitoring of Electronic Products for Health Assessment and Product Design International Journal of Quality Technology and Quantitative Management 2\(4 235-250 2007 2 J Gu N Vichare T Tracy and M Pecht Prognostics Implementation Methods for Electronics 53rd Annual Reliability  Maintainability Symposium RAMS Florida 2007 3 G Zhang C Kwan R Xu N Vichare and M Pecht An Enhanced Prognostic Model for Intermittent Failures in Digital Electronics IEEE Aerospace Conference Big Sky MT March 2007 4 N Vichare and M Pecht Enabling Electronic Prognostics Using Thermal Data Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Thermal Investigation of ICs and Systems Nice Cote d'Azur France 27-29 September 2006 5 N Vichare P Rodgers and M Pecht Methods for Binning and Density Estimation of Load Parameters for Prognostics and Health Management International Journal of Performability Engineering Vol 2 No 2 April 2006 6 A Fraser N Hengartner K Vixie and B Wohlberg Incorporating Invariants in Mahalanobis Distance based Classifiers Application to Face Recognition in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN Portland OR USA Jul 2003 7 J Edward Jackson Govind S Mudholkar Control Procedures for Residuals Associated With Principal Component Analysis Technometrics Vol.21 No.3 1979 8 J Liu Khiang-Wee Lim R Srinivasan and X Doan On-Line Process Monitoring and Fault Isolation Using PCA Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Symposium on Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation pp 658 661 2005 9 G Taguchi S Chowdhury and Y Wu The Mahalanobis-Taguchi System New York McGrawHill 2001 10 E B Martin A J Morris and J Zhang Process Performance Monitoring Using Multivariate Statistical Process CSontrol IEE Proc Control Theory Application Vol 143 No.2 March 1996 11 H Chen G Jiang C Ungureanu and K Yoshihira Failure Detection and Localization in Component Based Systems by Online Tracking KDD 2005 12 H Wang Z Song and P Li Fault Detection Behavior and Performance Analysis of Principal Component Analysis Based Process Monitoring Methods American Chemical Society Vol 41 pp 2455 2464 2002 13 H H Yue S.J Qin Reconstruction-Based Fault Identification Using a Combined Index American Chemical Society Vol 40 pp 4403-4414 2001 8

I r Z  Figure 9 A Military Modeling and Simulation Configuration of the Ilium Framework To do that we have assembled a collection of trusted military simulations that span the range of such applications from fine-grained simulations that focus on detailed interactions between two entities to coarse-grained simulations of military campaigns Figure 9 illustrates the Ilium Framework configured to accommodate those simulations as well as representative prototype systems In this case the legacy applications are simulations analysis systems and design tools Prototypes are notional UAV autopilots route planners decision support systems and similar applications The Framework augments these applications with control objects and agents that coordinate computations in the composed system and specialize agents that typically represent the characteristics of a new system or technology that cannot be easily or adequately simulated in any of the component legacy systems In our current study the following systems have Ilium Framework plugins and are used as components in the study environment 12 Al f<cOmmi.ain FIa 1A  


THUNDER is a campaign simulation that models national military forces and military operations that extend over months 30  Characteristics of individual systems are evaluated statistically and their effects on the overall campaign are not explicitly known Political social and cultural objects and concepts are not included in the model In this configuration THUNDER is used to generate force level tasking mission orders and to evaluate and adjust for the results of missions with respect to campaign plans SEAS is a force level simulation that simulates battles between major forces in combat operations that typically last for hours and as much as a day SEAS features a flexible rules based decision logic that can influence behavior at both the commander and individual combatant level SEAS executes the missions requested by THUNDER and provides a manageable dynamic context for examining the behavior of prototypes in a range of typical operational situations  31 A dynamic plug-in supports interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components EADSIM is a trusted model of air defense systems that is in particular sensitive to many important design attributes of individual systems In certain modified forms it can reference advanced sensor and engagement decision models In our study configuration EADSIM simulates enemy air defenses in selected e.g significant to our investigation portions of the virtual battle A dynamic plug-in supports system control as well as interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components A prototype aircraft mission planning system plug-in supports virtual real time mission plan creation and updates In particular the system provides automatic route planning for selected platforms that have been assigned missions by THUNDER and that are subsequently executed in simulation in SEAS and EADSIM The Ilium Framework itself provides software agents that are used to model notional or experimental UAV characteristics and behaviors Depending on the objectives of a particular study the Framework may also provide agents that address advanced Command and Control concepts to coordinate the interaction of the various component systems We maintain a semantic consistency among the plugged-in component applications by developing a single operational scenario as initial input for a study and deriving the necessary application configuration data from that source We create an RDF model of the scenario based on the Ilium suite of ontologies that includes political context issues objectives sensitivities etc military context centers of gravity campaign objectives etc geophysical environment military units order of battle unit equipment lists etc command and control assets platforms weapons ISR systems etc Figure 11 below is an excerpt from an operational scenario set in the Southwest U.S depicting a description of an Air Force Wing assigned to a notional Joint Task Force The Wing is based at Bishop Air Base and has six Fighter Squadrons assigned to it Additional detail about each of those squadrons as well as the base is found in the model in this case an rdf:resource  associated with it morg:AirForceWing rdf:ID="USAF_366 Air_Exp Wg dc:creator>Doug Holmes</dc:creator mgeo:basedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB geo:positionedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB_pos morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 390_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_494_Ftr_Sq dc date I 0/20/07</dc date morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_496 Ftr_Sq rdfs:comment>366 AEW F-22 F-15 KC-135 130]</rdfs:comment morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 389_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 391 Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 495_Ftr_Sq rdfs:label>366 Air Expeditionary Wing</rdfs:label morg:AirForceWing ab9 7P.b ii uI1 L L CFigure 11 An RDF model of a notional USAF Wing Figure 12 is another excerpt from the same scenario illustrating a model of a particular Fighter Squadron and one of the F-15E aircraft it operates Figure 10 Legacy Components in the Ilium Framework 13 suka

aircraft Note that these models also have associated SEAS models that contain information peculiar to the SEAS simulation about these entities This information is used to configure SEAS to properly represent these particular entities We are also able to insert objects and information that may be of interest in our study that is not represented in any of the component simulations or other applications Where those objects are related to an object that is simulated that relationship permits inferences about the effects on them as a result of actions that are computed in a simulation For example it is possible to indicate that GeorgeAB defends the capital city and lend special significance to the actions of aircraft that are based there even though none of the simulations in the composite system have any notion of capital city Finally the operational scenario provides an explicit record of the assumptions that underly the study and can also include and explicit representation of system and study goals This practice improves analysis and may enable future knowledge based analytical tools Throughout the process of constructing the operational scenario and when it is complete we use one or more Description Logic Reasoners to ensure the logical consistency of the the model A number of these automatic theorem provers are freely available including Pellet 32 33 FaCT  34 and OWLIM 35 are used in the Framework to compute logical entailments and to complete RDF models as well as to ensure the consistency of models In the later capacity frequent checks will identify errors in the construction some e.g Pellet also indicate the source of the error and aid in repairing it As a result we are confident that the operational scenario is a sound model The primary use of the Reasoners allows us to significantly extend the explicit RDF model that is created For example a squadron is explicitly specified as assignedTo a wing and that relationship is the inverse of assignedOrg then the system can infer that the wing has the squadron as an assigned organization even though that fact has never been asserted Similarly if the same relationship is defined as a transitive relationship it is possible to infer that a flight that is assigned to the squadron is also assigned to the wing Once we have an operational scenario that has been classified by a Reasoner we then use the completed model to configure the composite system Ilium and the pluggedin systems to execute the simulation We use SPARQL a W3C standard query language designed to access RDFL to extract data from the scenario to create the input files needed to configure the various applications.[36 SELECT name pos long lat alt vis W1HLERE name rdf:type mast SeasLocation name geo:positionedAt pos pos pos:long long pos pos:lat lat pos pos:alt alt name msim:Visible vis  Figure 13 A typical SPARQL query In a similar fashion SPARQL is used to extract data from the scenario to create the necessary Ilium java surrogate control and agents SPARQL can also be used to review the scenario and answer questions that have arisen since the inception of the study At this point we are able execute the scenario with confidence that it will produce reliable results 7 CONCLUSIONS We have developed a methodology and supporting tools for creating an operational scenario that supports the semantic interoperability of an ad hoc collection of legacy applications and extends their capabilities The method depends on and ensures the logical integrity of the composite system Therefore when we assemble as a collection of legacy component systems that were not originally intended to interoperate with other systems we can be confidant that the composite system will produce consistent results Logical consistency implies that to the degree that we trust the interpretation underlying the model the results of operations on the model are trustworthy If for example the model is based on a Newtonian interpretation of physics the model ought to provide reliable answers to questions about automotive and even aeronautical engineering but probably not to all questions in astronomy or cosmology This methodology extends the utility of trusted simulations allowing integration of finegrained simulations that are sensitive to design requirements with high level coarse-grained simulations that are sensitive to acquisition issues and policy The potential benefits of 14 


this sort of interoperation may range from obvious production efficiencies to clearer insights into system requirements Finally an important side-effect of the approach is the OWL/RDF knowledge base formed by the combination of the operational scenario and the results of the operations of the legacy systems That knowledge base and the use of SPARQL queries and SWRL rules effectively expands the functionality of the system and greatly improves the analysis of the output of the system of cooperating simulations and tools We have prepared a foundation for the application of Semantic Web and other knowledge based tools in the analysis and design of unmanned systems We anticipate the development and application of these tools and the addition of autonomy directed Multiple Agent Systems MAS that use RDF/XML inter-agent communications in the coming year REFERENCES 1 NAFCAM 2001 Exploiting EManufacturing:Ineroperability of Software Systems Used by U.S Manufacturers available at 12 Protege Ontology Editor documentation available at http proteae.stanf6rd.edu 13 Top Braid Composer Datasheet available at 14 W and Nicola Guarino 2001 Support for Ontological Analysis of Taxonomic Relationships J Data and Knowled 39\(1 October 2001 15 Natalya F Noy and Deborah L McGuinness Ontology Development 10 1 A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology  Stanford University Stanford CA 94305 16 Alan Rector Modularisation of Domain Ontologies Implemented in Description Logics and related formalisms including OWL K-CAP'03 October 23-25 2003 Sanibel Island Florida USA pp 121-8 2003 17 Cyc Homepage available at htc.c 18 Open Cyc home page available at 19 SUMO Description and Home Page available at 19 SENSUS Description and Home Page available at 2 Bemers-Lee Tim Hendler Jim Lasilla Ora The Semantic Web Scientific American available at 20 DOLCE A Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering ontology and documents available at 3 Bemers-Lee Tim Blog on Design Issues available at 4 RDF Primer available at s chema/#ref-rdf-primer 5 Lacey Lee OWL Representing Information Using the Web Ontology Language Trafford Publishing 2005 6 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at Jten pHomewPage availal adt 7 Jena Home Page available at 8 Protege Home Page available at h1ttp  protegest nftanford.edu,X 1 9 Baader Calvanese McGuiness Nardi and PatelSchnieder Description Logic Handbook 10 Oberle Daniel Semantic Management of Middleware Springer 2006 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at 21 Nicola Gauarino Claudio Masolo Stefano Borgo Aldo Gangemi and Alessandro Oltramari Ontology Infrastructure for the Semantic Web Wonder World Deliverable DI 8 Laboratory for Applied Ontology Trento Italy 2001 available on line at ht X1t1 22 DUL.owl ontology available at www.1oa23t og DLl 23 Amy Knutilla Steven Polyak Craig Schlenoff Austin Tate Shu Chiun Cheah Steven Ray and Richard Anderson Process Specification Language An Analysis of Existing Representations NIST report available at http llwww.mel.nlist.gov/msid.librarZ/d.oc/psl-1 _.df 24 Process Specification Language Ontology available at http-//www,55,me l.nit gov/psl 25 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 owl ontology available at ok i.cae.drexel.edu./-wbs/onltology/2004/09/ogc-gmI1 26 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 of Open GIS Consortium OGC Home Page available at 15

 17 Chris Burton received an Associate degree in electronic systems technology from the Community College of the Air force in 1984 and a BS in Electrical Engineering Technology from Northeastern University in 1983.  Prior to coming to the Georgia Institute of Technology \(GTRI\ in 2003, Chris was a BMEWS Radar hardware manager for the US Air Force and at MITRE and Xontech he was responsible for radar performance analysis of PAVE PAWS, BMEWS and PARCS UHF radar systems Chris is an accomplished radar-systems analyst familiar with all hardware and software aspects of missile-tracking radar systems with special expertise related to radar cueing/acquisition/tracking for ballistic missile defense ionospheric effects on UHF radar calibration and track accuracy, radar-to-radar handover, and the effects of enhanced PRF on radar tracking accuracy.  At GTRI, Chris is responsible for detailed analysis of ground-test and flight-test data and can be credited with improving radar calibration, energy management, track management, and atmospheric-effects compensation of Ballistic Missile Defense System radars   Paul D. Burns received his Bachelor of Science and Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering at Auburn University in 1992 and 1995 respectively. His Master\222s thesis research explored the utilization of cyclostationary statistics for performing phased array blind adaptive beamforming From 1995 to 2000 he was employed at Dynetics, Inc where he performed research and analysis in a wide variety of military radar applications, from air-to-air and air-toground pulse Doppler radar to large-scale, high power aperture ground based phased array radar, including in electronic attack and protection measures. Subsequently, he spent 3 years at MagnaCom, Inc, where he engaged in ballistic missile defense system simulation development and system-level studies for the Ground-based Midcourse defense \(GMD\ system. He joined GTRI in 2003, where he has performed target tracking algorithm research for BMD radar and supplied expertise in radar signal and data processing for the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy Integrated Warfare Systems 2.0 office.  Mr. Burns has written a number of papers in spatio-temporal signal processing, sensor registration and target tracking, and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the Georgia Institute of Technology  


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds.
