 Data intensive computing presents a significant challenge for traditional supercomputing architectures that maximize FLOPS since CPU speed has surpassed IO capabilities of HPC systems and BeoWulf clusters. We present the architecture for a three tier commodity component cluster designed for a range of data intensive computations operating on petascale data sets named GrayWulf  The design goal is a balanced system in terms of IO performance and memory size, according to Amdahlês Laws. The hardware currently installed at JHU exceeds one petabyte of storage and has 0.5 bytes/sec of I/O and 1 byte of memory for each CPU cycle. The GrayWulf provides almost an order of magnitude better balance than existing systems. The paper covers its 
architecture and reference applications. The software design is presented in a companion paper   1  Trends of Scientific Computing  The nature of high performance computing is changing. While a few years ago much of high-end computing involved maximizing CPU cycles per second allocated for a given problem; today it revolves around performing computations over large data sets. This means that efficient data access from disks and data movement across servers is an essential part of the computation Data sets are doubling every year, growing slightly faster than Moore

s Fourth Paradigm of Science based on Data Analytics Much data is observational, due to the rapid emergence of successive generations of inexpensive electronic sensors. At the same time large numerical simulations are also generating data sets with increasing resolutions, both in the spatial and temporal sense. These data sets are typically tens to hundreds of terabyt lt, scie n t i s ts are in a dire need of a scalable solution for data-intensive computing The broader scientific community has traditionally preferred to use inexpensive computers to solve their computational problems, rather than remotely located high-end supercomputers. First they used VAXes in the 80s followed by low-cost 
workstations. About 10 years ago it became clear that the computational needs of many scientists exceeded that of a single workstation and many users wanted to avoid the large, centralized supercomputer centers This was when laboratories started to build computational clusters from commodity components The idea and phenomenal success of the BeoWulf clus h o w s t h at scientis ts \(i er to h a v e a  solution that is under their direct control, \(ii\ite willing to use existing proven and successful templates, and, \(iii\enerally want a do-it-yourself  inexpensive solution As an alternative to 
building your own cluster  bringing computations to the free computer resource became a successful paradigm, Grid Computing This self-organizing model, where groups of scientists pool computing resources irrespective of their physical location suits applications that require lots of CPU time with relatively little data movement For data intensive app lications the concept of cloud computing is emerging where data and computing are co-located at a large centralized facility, and accessed as well-defined services.

offers many advantages over the grid-based model and is especially applicable where many users access shared common datasets. It is still not clear how willing scientists will be to use such remote clouds ecen t l y Goog le a nd IBM h a v e  m a de s u c h  a facility available for the academic community Due to these data intensive scientific problems a new challenge is emerging, as many groups in science \(but also beyond\acing analyses of data sets in tens of terabytes, eventually extending to a petabyte since disk access and data-rates have not grown with their size. There is no magic way to manage and analyze such data sets today. The problem exists both on the hardware and the software levels The requirements for the data analysis environment are \(i\scalability, including the ability to evolve over a long period, \(ii\rformance, \(iii ease of use, \(iv\ some fault tolerance and \(v\most important low  entry cost    2  Database-Centric Computing  2.1  Bring analysis to the data, not vice-versa  Many of the typical data access patterns in science require a first, rapid pass through the data with relatively few CPU cycles carried out on each byte. These involve filtering by a simple search pattern, or computing a statistical aggregate, very much in the spirit of a simple mapping step of MapRedu ch operation s are als o qu ite naturally performed within a relational database, and expressed in SQL. So a traditional relational database fits these patterns extremely well The picture gets a little more complicated when one needs to run a more complex algorithm on the data, not necessarily easily expressed in a declarative language. Examples of such applications can include complex geospatial queries, processing time series data, or running the BLAST algorithm for gene sequence matching The traditional approach of bringing the data to where there is an analysis facility is inherently not scalable, once the data sizes exceed a terabyte due to network bandwidth, latency, and cost. It has been suggest h at t h e best a pproach is to bring  th e  analysis to the data. If the data are stored in a relational database, nothing is closer to the data than the CPU of the database server. It is quite easy today with most relational database systems to import procedural \(even object oriented\d expose their methods as user defined functions within the query This approach has proved to be very successful in many of our reference applications, and while writing class libraries linked against SQL was not always the easiest coding paradigm, its excellent performance made the coding effort worthwhile  2.2  Typical scientific workloads  Over the last few years we have implemented several eScience applications, in experimental dataintensive physical sciences applications such as astronomy, oceanography and water resources. We have been monitoring the usage and the typical workloads corresponding to different types of users When analyzing the workload on the publicly available multi-terabyte Sloan Digital Survey SkyServer database w a s f oun d t h at m o s t us er  metrics have a 1/f power law distribution  Of the several hundred million data accesses most queries were very simple, single row lookups in the data set, which heavily used indices such as on position over the celestial sphere \(nearest object queries\. These made up the high frequency, low volume part of the power law distribution. On the other end there were analyses which did not map very well on any of the precomputed indices, thus the system had to perform a sequential scan, often combined with a merge join. These often took over an hour to scan through the multi-terabyte database In order to submit a long query, users had to register with an email address, while the short accesses were anonymous  2.3  Advanced user patterns  We have noticed a pattern in-between these two types of accesses. Long, sequential accesses to the data were broken up into small, templated queries typically implemented by a simple client-side Python script, submitted once in every 10 seconds. These crawlers had the advantage from the user s perspective of returning data quickly, and in small buckets. If the inspection of the first few buckets hinted at an incorrect request \(in the science sense the users could terminate the queries without having to wait too long The power users have adopted a different pattern. Their analyses typically involve a complex multi-step workflow, where the correct end result is approached in a multi-step hit-and-miss fashion Once they zoom in on a final workflow, they execute it over the whole data set, by submitting a large job into a batch queue In order to support this, we have built MyDB a server-side workbench environmen h ere u s ers Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


get their own database with enough disk space to store all the intermediate results. Since this is serverside, the bandwidth is very high, even though the user databases reside on a separate server. Users have full control over their own databases, and they are able to perform SQL joins with all the data tables in the main archive The workbench also supports easy upload of user data into the system, and a collaborative environment, where users can share tables with one another. This environment has proved itself to be incredibly successful. Today 1,600 astronomers approximately 10 percent of the world s professional astronomy population, are daily users of this facility In summary, most scientific analyses are done in a exploratory fashion, where everything goes and few predefined patterns apply. Users typically want to experiment, try many innovative things that often do not fit preconceived notions, and would like to get very rapid feedback on the momentary approach. In the next sections we will discuss how we expand this framework and environment substantially beyond the terabyte scale of today   3  Building Balanced Systems  3.1  Amdahl s laws  Amdahl has established several laws for building a balanced computer system T h es e w e re reviewed recently t h e con t ex t of t h e ex plos ion of data. The paper pointed out that contemporary computer systems IO subsystems are lagging CPU cycles. In the discussion below we will be concerned with two of Amdahl s Laws  A balanced system   needs one bit of IO for each CPU cycle   has 1 byte of memory for each CPU cycle  These laws enumerate a rather obvious statement  in order to perform continued generic computations we need to be able to deliver data to the CPU through the memory. Amdahl observed that these ratios need to be close to unity and this need has stayed relatively constant The emergence of multi-level caching led to several papers pointing out that a much lower IO to MIPS ratio coupled with a large enough memory can still provide a satisfactory performan h ile  this is true for problems that mostly fit in memory, it fails to extend to computations that need to process so much data \(PB\ that they must reside on external disk storage. At that point having a fast memory cache is not much help, since the bottleneck is disk IO  3.2  Raw sequential IO  For very large data sets the only way we can even hope to accomplish the analysis if we follow a maximally sequential read pattern. Over the last 10 years while disk sizes have increased by a factor of 1,000, the rotation speed of large disks used in disk arrays has only changed a factor of 2 from 5,400 rpm to 10,000 rpm. Thus random access times of disks have only improved about 7% per year The sequential IO rate has grown somewhat faster as the density of the disks has increased by the square root of disk capacity. For commodity SATA drives the sequential IO performance is typically 60MB/sec compared with 20MB/sec 10 years ago. Nevertheless compared to the increase of the data volumes and the CPU speedups, this increase is not fast enough to conduct business as usual. Just loading a terabyte at this rate takes 4.5 hours. Given this sequential bottleneck, the only way to increase the disk throughput of the system is to add more and more disk drives and to eliminate obvious bottlenecks in the rest of the system  3.3  Scale-up or scale-out  A 20-30TB data set is too large to fit on a single inexpensive server. One can scale-up, buying an expensive multiprocessor box with many fiber channel \(FC\ Host Channel Adapters \(HCA\nd a FC disk array, easily exceeding the $1M price tag The performance of such systems is still low especially for sequential IO. To build a system with over one GB/sec sequential IO speed one needs at least 8 FC adapters. While this may be attractive for management, the entry cost is not low Scaling out using a cluster of disks attached to each computing node provides a much more cost effective and high throughput solution, very much along the lines of BeoWulf designs. The sequential read speed of a properly balanced mid-range server with many local disks can easily exceed a GB/sec before saturation T h e cos t of  s u c h a s e rv er can be kept close to the $10,000 range. On the other hand managing an array of such systems, and manually partitioning the data can be quite a challenge. Instead of mid-range servers the scale-out can be done on lower-end machines, and deployed to a very large number \(~100,000\ done by Google Given the success of the BeoWulf concept for academic research, we believe that the dominant Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


solution in this environment will be deployed locally Given the scarcity of space at universities it also needs to have a high packing density   4  The GrayWulf System  4.1. Overall Design Principles  We are building a combined hardware and software platform from commodity components to perform large-scale database-centric computations The system should  a  scale to petabyte-size data sets b  provide very high sequential bandwidth to data c  support most eScience access patterns d  provide simple tools for database design e  provide tools for fast data ingest  This paper describes the system hardware and the hardware monitor tools. A second paper describes the software tools that provide functionality for \(c e  4.2. Modular, layered architecture   Our cluster consists of modular building blocks in three tiers. Having multiple tiers provides a system with a certain amount of hierarchical spread of memory and disk storage. The low level data can be spread evenly among server nodes on the lowest tier all running in parallel, while query aggregations are done on more powerful servers in the higher tiers The lowest, tier 1 building block is a single 2U sized Dell 2950 server, with two quad core 2.66GHz CPUs.  Each server has 16 GB of memory, two PCIe PERC6/E dual-channel RAID controllers and a 20 Gbit/sec QLogic SilverStorm Infiniband HCA, with a PCIe interface. Each server is connected to two 3-U MD1000 SAS disk boxes that contain a total of 30 750 GB, 7,200 rpm SATA disks. Each disk box is connected to its dedicated dual-channel controller see section 4.3\here are two mirrored 73 GB 15,000 rpm disks residing in internal bays, connected to a controller on the motherboard. These disks contain the operating system and the rest of the installed software. Thus, each of these modules takes up 8 rack units, and contains a total of 22.5TB of data storage. Four of these units with UPS power is put in a rack. The whole lower tier consists of 10 such racks, with a total of 900TB of data space, and 640 GB of memory Tier 2 consists of four Dell R900 servers with 16 cores each and 64 GB of memory, connected to three of the MD1000 disk boxes, each populated as above There is one dual channel PERC6/E controller for each disk box. The system disks are two mirrored 73GB SAS drives at 10,000 rpm and a 20Gbit/sec SilverStorm Infiniband HCA. This layer has a total of 135TB of data storage and 256GB of memory. We also expect that data sets that need to be sorted and/or rearranged will be moved to these servers, utilizing the larger memory Finally, tier 3 consists of two Dell R900 servers with 16 cores, 128 GB of memory, each connected to a single MD1000 disk box with 15 disks, and a SilverStorm IB card. The total storage is 22.5TB and the memory is 256 GB. These servers can also run some of the resource intensive applications, complex data intensive web services \(still inside the SQL Server engine using CLR integration\ which require more physical memory than available on the lower tiers   server core mem[GB  disk[TB  Count Tier 1 2950 8 16 22.50 40 Tier 2 R900 16 64 33.75 4 Tier 3 R900 16 128 11.25 2 total  416 1152 1057.50 46 Table 1. Tabular description of the three tiers of the cluster with aggregates for cores, memory and disk space within our GrayWulf system   The Infiniband interconnect is through a Qlogic SilverStorm 9240 288 port switch, with acrosssectional aggregate bandwidth of 11.52 Tbit/s. The switch also contains a 10 Gbit/sec Ethernet module that connects any server to our dedicated single lambda National Lambda Rail connection over the Infiniband fabric, without the need for dedicated 10 Gbit Ethernet adapters for the servers Initial Infiniband testing suggests that we should be able to utilize at least the Infiniband Sockets Direct Protocol[16 o r com m u n i ca tion bet w ee n SQ L Server instances, and that the SDP links should sustain at least 800-850 MB/sec. Of course, we hope to achieve the ideal near-wirespeed throughput of the 20 Gbit/sec fabric. This seems feasible, as we will have ample opportunity to tune the interconnect, and the Windows Infiniband stack itself is evolving rapidly these days Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


The cluster is running Windows Enterprise Server 2008 and the database engine is SQL Server 2008 that is automatically deployed across the cluster  4.3. Balanced IO bandwidth   The most important consideration when we designed the system \(besides staying within our budget\was to avoid the obvious choke points in terms of streaming data from disk to CPU, then across the interconnect laye r. These bottlenecks can exist all over the system: the storage bus \(FC, SATA SAS, SCSI\e storage controllers, the PCI buses system memory itself, and in the way that software chooses to access the storage. It can be tricky to create a system that dodges all of them The disks A single 7,200 rpm 750 GB SATA drive can sustain about 75 MB/sec sequential reads at the outer cylinders, and somewhat less on the inner parts The storage interconnect We are using Serial Attached SCSI \(SAS\r SATA drives to our systems. SAS is built on full-duplex 3 Gbit/sec lanes which can be either point-to-point \(i.e dedicated to a single drive\ or can be shared by multiple drives via SAS expanders which behave much like network switches. Prior parallel SCSI standards like Ultra320 accommodated only expensive native SCSI drives, which are great for IOPS-driven applications, but are not as compelling for petascale, sequentially-accessed data sets. In addition to supporting native SAS/SCSI devices, SAS also supports SATA drives, by adopting a physical layer compatible with SATA, and by including a Serial ATA Tunneling Protocol within the SAS protocol. For large, fast, potentially low-budget storage applications, SATA over SAS is a terrific compromise between enterprise-class FC and SCSI storage, and the inexpensive but fragile SATA bricks which are particularly ubiquitous in research circles The SCSI protocol itself operates with a 25% bus overhead. So for a 3 Gbit/sec SAS lane, the realworld sustainable throughput is about 225 MB/sec The Serial ATA Tunneling Protocol introduces an additional 20% overhead, so the real-world SAS-lane throughput is about 180 MB/s when using SATA drives The disk enclosures Each Dell MD1000 15-disk enclosure uses a single SAS 4x connection. 4x is a bundle of four 3 Gbit/sec lanes, carried externally Infiniband 20Gbits/s 10 Gbits/s Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Interconnect 320 CPU 640GB memory 900TB disk 96 CPU 512GB memory 158TB disk Infiniband 20Gbits/s 10 Gbits/s Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Interconnect 320 CPU 640GB memory 900TB disk 96 CPU 512GB memory 158TB disk  Figure 1.

over a standard Infiniband-like cable with Infinibandlike connectors. This 12 Gbit/sec connection to the controller is very nice relative to common 4 Gbit/sec FC interconnects. But with SATA drives, the actual sustainable throughput over this 12 Gbit/sec connection is 720 MB/sec. Thus we have already introduced a moderate bottleneck relative to the ideal 1100 MB/sec throughput of our 15 750 MB/sec drives. For throughput purposes, only about 10 drives are needed to saturate an MD1000 enclosure s SAS backplane The disk controllers The LSI Logic based Dell PERC6/E controller has dual 4x SAS channels, and has a feature set which is common among contemporary RAID controllers. Why do we go to the trouble and the expense of using one controller per disk enclosure when we could easily attach one dedicated 4x channel to each enclosure using a single controller? Our tests show that the PERC6 controllers themselves saturate at about 800 MB/sec, so to gain additional throughput as we add more drives, we need to add more controllers It is convenient that a single controller is so closely matched to a SATApopulated enclosure The PCI and memory busses The Dell 2950 servers have two x8 PCI Express connections and one x4 connection, rated at 2000 MB/sec and 1000 MB/s half-duplex speeds respectively. We can safely use the x4 connection for one of our PERC6 controllers since we expect no more than 720 MB/s from these. The 2000 MB/sec-each x8 connections are plenty for one of the PERC6 controllers, and just enough for our 20 Gbit/sec DDR Infiniband HCAs Our basic tests suggest that the 2950 servers can read from memory at 5700 MB/sec, write at 4100 MB/sec and copy at 2300 MB/sec. This is a pretty good match to our 1440 MB/sec of disk bandwidth and 2000 MB/sec Infiniband bandwidth, though in the ideal case with every component performing flat-out the system backplane itself could potentially slow us down a bit Test methodology We use a combination of Jim Gray s MemSpeed tool, and SQLIO  S peed measures system memory performance itself, along with basic buffered and unbuffered sequential disk performance. SQLIO can perform various IO performance tests using IO operations that resemble what SQL Server s. Using SQLIO, we typically test sequential reads and writes, and random IOPS, but we re most concerned with sequential read performance. Performance measurements presented here are typically based on SQLIO s sequential read test, using 128 KB requests, one thread per system processor, and 32-deep requests per thread. We believe that this resembles the typical table scan behavior of SQL Server s Enterprise Edition. We find that the IO speeds that we measure with SQLIO are very good predictors for SQL Server s real-world IO performance In Figure 3, we present our measurements of the saturation points of various components of the GrayWulf s IO system. The labels on the plots designate the number of controllers, the number of disk boxes, and the number of SAS lanes for each experiment. The 1C-1B-2S plot shows a pair of 3 Gbit/sec SAS lanes saturating near the expected 360           0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 0 5 10 15 20 25 Disks MB/s 1C-1B-2S 1C-1B-4S 1C-2B-8S 2C-2B-8S  Figure 3.

MB/sec mark 1C-1B-4S shows the full 4x SAS connection of one of the MD1000 disk boxes saturating at the expected 720 MB/sec 1C-2B-8S  demonstrates that the PERC6 controller saturates at just under 1 GB/sec 2C-2B-8S shows the performance of the actual Tier 1 GrayWulf nodes right at twice the 1C-1B-4S performance The full cluster contains 96 of the 720 MB/sec PERC6/MD1000 building blocks. This translates to an aggregate low-level throughput of about 70 GB/sec. Even though the bandwidth of the interconnect is slightly below that of the disk subsystem, we do not regard this as a major bottleneck, since in our typical applications the data is first filtered and/or aggregated, before it is sent across the network for further stream aggregation This filtering operation will result in a reduction of the data volume to be sent across the network \(for most scenarios\ thus a factor of 2 lower network throughput compared to the disk IO is quite tolerable The other factor to note is that for our science application the relevant calculations take place at the backplanes of the individual servers, and the higher level aggregation requires a much lower bandwidth at the upper tiers  4.4. Monitoring Tools  The full-scale GrayWulf system is rather complex, with many components performing tasks in parallel. We need a detailed performance monitoring subsystem that can track and quantitatively measure the behavior of the hardware. We need the performance data in several different contexts   track and monitor the status of computer and network hardware in the traditional sense   as a tool to help design and tune individual SQL queries, monitor level of parallelism   track the status of long-running queries particularly those that are heavy consumers of CPU, disk, or network resources in one or more of the GrayWulf machines The performance data are acquired both from the well-known PerfMon Windows Performance Data Helper\nters and from selected SQL Server Dynamic Management Views \(DMVs\. To understand the resource utilization of different longrunning GrayWulf queries, it is useful to be able to relate DMV performance observations of SQL Server objects such as filegroups with PerfMon observations of per-processor CPU utilization and logical disk volume IO Performance data for SQL queries are gathered by a C# program that monitors SQL Trace events and samples performance counters on one or more SQL Servers. The data is aggregated in a SQL database where performance data is associated with individual SQL queries.  This part of the monitoring represented a particular challenge in a parallel environment, since SQL Server does not provide an easy mechanism to follow process identifiers for remote subqueries. Data gathering is limited to interesting SQL queries which are annotated by specially-formatted SQL comments whose contents are also recorded in the database   5  Reference Applications  We have several reference applications, each corresponding to a different kind of data layout, and thus a different access pattern. These range from computational fluid dynamics to astronomy, each consisting of datasets close to or exceeding 100TB  5.1. Immersive Turbulence  The first application is in computational fluid dynamic, CFD, to analyze large hydrodynamic simulations of turbulent flow. The state-of-the-art simulations have spatial resolutions of 4096 3 and consist of hundreds if not thousands of timesteps While current supercomputers can easily run these simulations it is becoming increasingly difficult to perform subsequent analyses of the results. Each timestep over such a spatial resolution can be close to a terabyte. Storing the data from all timesteps requires a storage facility reaching hundreds of terabytes. Any analysis of the data requires the users to analyze these data sets, which requires accessing the same compute/storage facility. As the cutting edge simulations become ever larger, fewer and fewer scientists can participate in the subsequent analysis. A new paradigm is needed, where a much broader class of users can perform analyses of such data sets A typical scenario is that scientists want to inject a number of particles \(5,000-50,000\to the simulation and follow their trajectories. Since many of the CFD simulations are performed in Fourier space, over a regular grid, no labeled particles exist in the output data. At JHU we have developed a new paradigm to interact with such data sets using a webservices interfa  A large number of timesteps are stored in the database, organized along a convenient threedimensional spatial index based on a space-filling curve \(Peano-Hilbert, or z-transform\. The disk layout closely preserves the spatial proximity of grid Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


cells, making disk access of a coherent region more sequential. The data for each timestep is simply sliced across N servers, shown as scenario \(a\on Figure 4. The slicing is done along a partitioning key derived from the space filling curve Spatial and temporal interpolation functions are implemented inside the database that can compute the velocity field at an arbitrary spatial and temporal coordinate. A scientist with a laptop can insert thousands of particles into the simulation by requesting the velocity filed at those locations. Given the velocity values, the laptop can then integrate the particles forward, and again request the velocities at the updated location and so on. The resulting trajectories of the particles have been integrated on the laptop, but they correspond to the velocity field inside the simulation spanning hundreds of terabytes This is digital equivalent of launching sensors into a vortex of a tornado, like the scientists in the movie Twister  This computing model has been proven extremely successful; we have so far ingested a 1024 3  simulation into a prototype SQL Server cluster, and created the above mentioned interpolating functions configured as a TVF \(table valued function\ide the database h e data has been  m a de p u blicl y  available. We also created a Fortran\(!\ harness to call the web service, since most of the CFD community is still using that language  5.2. SkyQuery  The  SkyQuery 2 e rv ice h a s been origin a l l y  created as part of the National Virtual Observatory. It is a universal web services based federation tool performing cross-matches \(fuzzy geospatial joins over large astronomy data sets. It has been very successful, but has a major limitation. It is very good in handling small areas of the sky, or small userdefined data sets. But as soon as a user requests a cross-match over the whole sky, involving the largest data sets, generating hundreds of millions of rows, its efficiency rapidly deteriorates, due to the slow wide area connections Co-locating the data from the largest few sky surveys on the same server farm will give a dramatic performance improvement. In this case the crossmatch queries are running on the backplane of the database. We have created a zone-based parallel algorithm that can perform such spatial crossmatches in the database[21 ex tre m e l y  f a s t T h is algorithm has also been shown to run efficiently over a cluster of databases. We can perform a match between two datasets \(2MASS, 400M objects and USNOB, 1B objects\ in less than 2 hours on a single server. Our reference application for the GrayWulf is running parallel queries and merging the result set using a paradigm similar to the MapReduce algorithm Making use of threads and multiple servers we believe that on the JHU cluster can achieve a 20-fold speedup, yielding a result in a few minutes instead of a few hours. We use our spatial algorithms to compute the common sky area of the intersecting survey footprints then split this area equally among the participating servers, and include this additional spatial clause in each instance of the parallel queries for an optimal load balancing. The data layout in this case is a simple N-way replication of the data, as shown as part \(b\ Figure 4. The relevant database that contains all the catalogs is about 5TB, thus a 20way replication is still manageable. The different query streams will be aggregated on one of the Tier 3 nodes  5.3. Pan-STARRS  The Pan-STARRS proj a larg e astronomical survey, that will use a special telescope in Hawaii with a 1.4 gigapixel camera to sample the sky over a period of 4 years. The large field of view and the relatively short exposures will enable the telescope to cover three quarters of the sky 4 times per year, in 5 optical colors. This will result in more than a petabyte of images per year. The images will then be processed through an image segmentation pipeline that will identify individual detections, at the rate of 100 million detections per night. These detections will be associated with physical objects on  A B C D E F G H A B C D E F G H c\ierarchical A A A A A A A A b\plicated A B C D E F G H a\iced A B C D E F G H A B C D E F G H c\ierarchical A B C D E F G H A B C D E F G H A B C D E F G H A B C D E F G H A B C D E F G H A B C D E F G H A B C D E F G H c\ierarchical A A A A A A A A b\plicated A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A b\plicated A B C D E F G H a\iced A B C D E F G H A B C D E F G H a\iced  Figure 4.

The projected size of the database is 30 terabytes by the end of the first year, growing to 80 terabytes by the end of year 4 Expecting that most of the user queries will be ran against the physical object, it is natural to consider a hierarchical data layout, shown of section \(c Figure 4.  The star schema of the database naturally provides a framework for such an organization. The top level of the hierarchy contains the objects, which are logically partitioned into N segments, but they physically stored on one of the Tier 2 servers. The corresponding detections \(much larger in cardinality are then sliced among the N servers in the lowest Tier A B etc   6  Comparisons to Other Architectures  In this section we would like to consider several well-studied architectures for scientific High Performance Computing and calculate their Amdahl numbers for comparison. The Amdahl RAM number  is calculated by dividing the total memory in Gbytes with the aggregate instruction cycles in units of GIPS 1000 MIPS\The Amdahl IO number is computed by dividing the aggregate sequential IO speed of the system in Gbits/sec by the GIPS value. A ratio close to 1 indicates a balanced system in the Amdahl sense We consider first a typical University BeoWulf cluster, consisting of 50 3GHz dual-core machines each with 4GB of memory and one SATA disk drive with 60MB/sec. Next, we consider a typical desktop used by the average scientist, doing his/her own data analysis. Today such a machine has 2 3GHz CPUs 4GB of memory and 3 SATA disk drives, which provide an aggregate sequential IO of about 150MB/sec, since they all run off the motherboard controller. A virtual machine in a commercial cloud would have a single CPU, say at 3GHz, 4GB RAM but a lower IO speed of about 30MB/sec per VM instan Let us consider two hypothetical machines used in today s scientific supercomputing environments An approximate configuration SC1 for a typical BlueGene-like machine was obtained from the LLNL web pages h e s e qu e n ti al IO perf or m a n c e o f a n  IO-optimized BlueGene/L configuration with 256 IO nodes has been measured to reach 2.6 GB/sec peak si m p le m i n d ed s caling t h is res u lt to t h e  1664 IO nodes in the LLNL system gives us the hypothetical 16.9 GB/sec figure used in the table for SC1 The other hypothetical supercomputer SC2 has been modeled on the Cray XT-3 at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center. The XT-3 IO bandwidth is currently limited by the PSC Infiniband fa e h a v e als o att e m pted to g e t acc u rate numbers from several of the large cloud computing companies our efforts have not been successful unfortunately   7  Summary  The Graywulf IO numbers have been estimated from our single-node measurements of sequential IO performance and our typical reference workloads Table 2 shows that our GrayWulf architecture excels in aggregate IO performance as well as in the Amdahl IO metric, in some cases well over a factor of 50. It is interesting that the desktop of a data intensive user comes closest to the GrayWulf IO number of 0.5 System CPU count GIPS   RAM GB diskIO MB/s  Amdahl RAM IO BeoWulf 100 300 200 3000 0.67 0.080 Desktop 2 6 4 150 0.67 0.200 Cloud VM 1 3 4 30 1.33 0.080 SC1 212992 150000 18600 16900 0.12 0.001 SC2 2090 5000 8260 4700 1.65 0.008 GrayWulf 416 1107 1152 70000 1.04 0.506  Table 2. The two Amdahl numbers characterizing a balanced system are shown for a variety of systems commonly used in scientific computing today. Amdahl numbers close to 1 indicate a balanced architecture Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


In this paper we wanted to make a few simple points   Data-intensive scientific computations today require a large sequential IO speed more than anything else   As we consider higher and higher end systems their IO rate does not keep up with the CPUs   It is possible to build balanced IO intensive systems using commodity components   The total cost of the system \(exluding the Infiniband\ well under $800K   Our system satisfies the criteria in today s dataintensive environment similar to those that made the original BeoWulf idea so successful   8  Acknowledgements  The authors would like to thank Jim Gray for many years of intense collaboration and friendship Financial support for the GrayWulf cluster hardware was provided by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Microsoft Research and the PanSTARRS project.

Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal environment would be diminished as people understand e-commerce better and e-commerce becomes a common practice in the society  6.2. Policy implication  An effective research project is not only used to explain and predict social phenomena, but also to help humans master them to achieve social objectives through yielding useful policy recommendations [60 All sound policy prescriptions should rely on a solid theory base, valid data analysis, and rational discussion.  In reality, however, policymakers generally lack adequate scientific evidence and knowledge for making crucial decisions on ecommerce development.  The application of institutional theory in e-commerce adoption and its empirical findings in this study have a clear relevance to policy makers.  If we understand better at the theoretical level how those institutional factors would produce an outcome of e-commerce adoption, we then have the basis for a conditional prediction in the real world on how e-commerce will develop in a certain environment.  It will help policy makers to formulate appropriate policies to accelerate e-commerce adoption Experience has taught us that it is important to build a friendly climate for technology innovation and diffusion.  The effects of the legal and policy environments will depend to a significant extent on how policy-makers and other stakeholders will act and influence.  According to this study, this is particularly vital at the starting stage of e-commerce.  The advancement in e-commerce adoption at Phase I 2003 environment and government policy.  In particular proactive government policies were the prime mover of e-commerce in many developing countries, and it is still a driving force of e-commerce diffusion today The fosterage of government policy is summarized as follows.  First, government policies that encourage investment in IT adoption, particularly the financial incentives, are stimulating to e-commerce development.  Second, government efforts to promote an open and free trade environment, including deregulating telecom markets, improving IT infrastructure, and conducting e-procurement itself will encourage e-commerce adoption and diffusion Third, government?s assurance on recognizing econtracts and providing legitimate legal frameworks will facilitate e-commerce activities.  Fourth government?s educational and training program will foster ?e-literacy? and greater awareness of ecommerce among businesses.  Last, cooperation between government and private sector is a key to ecommerce On the other hand, this study also shows that the lack of adequate legal framework might be a concern for engaging in e-commerce at first, but that the lack thereof would not deter the society from further ecommerce diffusion. Thus, after an initial push on ecommerce adoption, legislations should not interfere directly in private investments in e-commerce until there is a clear sign of market uncertainty and disturbance Finally, as Kofi Annan, the former SecretaryGeneral of UN, indicated, ?if all countries are to be benefited [from e-commerce], ? more needs to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 done to ? create an enabling environment, nationally

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11

Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
