database instance capable of storing analyzing and searching data Each cube is established based on semantic aspects e.g 1 Topical 2 Contextual 3 Spatial or 4 Temporal A cube specializes in handling data that is only relevant to the cubeês semantics Knowledge cubes are inspired by two prime architectures 1 Dataspaces that provides an abstraction for data management where heterogeneous data sources can co-exist and it requires no prespeciìed unifying schema and 2 Linked Data that provides best practices for publishing and interlinking structured data on the web A knowledge cube uses Linked Data as its main building block for its data layer and encompasses some of the data integration abstractions deìned by Dataspaces In this paper knowledge cubes are proposed as a semantically-guided data management architecture where data management is inîuenced by the data semantics rather than by a predeìned scheme Knowledge cubes support the ve pillars of Big Data also known as the ve Vês namely Volume Velocity Veracity Variety and Value Interesting opportunities can be leveraged when learning the semantics of the data This paper highlights these opportunities and proposes a strawman design for knowledge cubes along with the research challenges that arise when realizing them Keywords big data architecture semantics data management I I NTRODUCTION Today we are surrounded by a plethora of information usually coined under the term Big Data  Big data requires exceptional technologies to efìciently process the large quantities of data within tolerable elapsed times The types of data include social media shared content web pages blogs photos videos and transaction records to name a few We need systems that can provide answers to questions that have been considered beyond our reach in the past given the amount of information that is required to be analyzed We describe two prime architectures for data management that inspire our proposal namely Dataspaces  and Linked Data  and illustrate ho w a h ybrid architecture could be created around them that tackles the challenges of Big Data Franklin Halvey and Maier coin the term Dataspaces 1 which is an abstraction for data bases that attempts to avoid data integration problems Dataspace systems use a Dataspaces Support Platform DSSP to provide interrelated services over its components Dataspaces consist of six logical components 1 Catalog for maintaining information about data sources 2 Local store and index 3 Search and query mechanism 4 Administration 5 Discovery for locating new data sources and maintaining existing ones and 6 Source extension that embeds participants with additional capabilities e.g schema catalog keyword search and update monitoring It is expensive to model an integration schema upfront especially with large-scale integration scenarios involving Big Data scale In order to mitigate this the data is not integrated by default and hence the system can answer only simple queries If more data needs to be integrated then it can follow a payas-you-go model Dataspaces are best suited for small-scale loosely coupled heterogeneous data sources It relies on a centralized catalog that is a key component in the success of the Dataspaces support platform Given the Big Data scale it would not be possible to rely on a central repository for materializing web data given its dynamic nature Tim-Berners Lee rst coined the term Linked Data i n 2006 Linked Data is about using the Web to connect related data that has not been previously linked It is a way of exposing sharing and connecting loosely coupled pieces of data and creating new knowledge Unlike Dataspaces one of the main principles of Linked Data lies in its decentralized setting that facilitates distributed publishing and maintenance of the combined data It uses a rich data model namely RDF to express the data through statements of equivalence subclasses and sub-property relations Many organizations and governments have adopted Linked Data as a way to publish their data This has created a global data space referred to as the Web of Data The W e b o f Data contains billions of RDF statements from a variety of sources covering various topics In fact the Web of Data can be considered a Dataspace with the difference that it is now distributed and spans a more global scale Another architecture for learning from web-scale data is NELL NELL realizes a n e v er ending learning agent that starts with an initial knowledge base of predicates and relations NELL grows the knowledge base continuously by reading and learning from the web using various components that make uncorrelated errors learning multiple types of interlinked knowledge using coupled semi-supervised learning methods to leverage constraints among predicates distinguishing high-conìdence beliefs from lower ones and using a uniform knowledge base representation to capture facts NELL needs human intervention to assert the correctness of identiìed 


entities to avoid aggregating the mistakes further We propose Knowledge Cubes a data management architecture for the Web of Data that relies on semantics to deìne how the data is fetched organized stored optimized and queried Knowledge cubes use RDF to store data This allows knowledge cubes to store Linked Data from the Web of Data Knowledge cubes are envisioned to break down the centralized architecture into multiple specialized cubes each having its own index and data store When a user query relies on data from multiple cubes these specialized cubes communicate to satisfy the userês query A cube is intelligent in identifying when to update its data based on query predicates and the frequency of the requested items In the following sections we introduce knowledge cubes and discuss the motivation for each of their architectural components Then we illustrate how knowledge cubes cater to the needs of the ve pillars of Big Data Finally  w e p ro vide a strawmanês design for the knowledge cubes architecture and highlight research challenges in its realization II M OTIVATION Handling Big Data scale is a fundamental challenge for the Web of Data Given the growing availability of Linked Data we are in need of systems capable of storing RDFês and evaluating complex queries over these large silos of interlinked datasets To be efìcient these systems should maintain a reasonable ratio of RAM and database size The y also need to have one index per database that can be updated as needed The system describes its data with a well-deìned representation e.g RDF that contains rich constructs to interlink Big Data resources We describe the following three motivational points that drive our knowledge cubes proposal A Semantically Partitioned Data We propose to partition and manage data based on semantics rather than on a predeìned partitioning scheme Linked Data with its rich semantics provides an excellent foundation for understanding and linking interrelated data With semantically partitioned data one can forward questions directly to speciìc knowledge cubes and get ne-grained answers in contrast to contacting a heterogeneous data source or multiple data sources in order to get an answer An advantage of this approach is that each specialized knowledge cube stores and continuously updates data from the web that is related only to the topic of interest to the knowledge cube and thus resulting in a notion of specialization These specialized knowledge cubes can inter-communicate to provide in-depth answers to users queries This approach also allows breaking the large data silo into meaningful and interrelated sets B Unsupervised Learning from Big Data Sources To harness the richness of Big Data knowledge cubes need to harvest as much information as possible from Big Data sources to enrich the current Linked Data of the knowledge cube This needs to be performed in an unsupervised fashion due to the immense amount of data that needs to be processed and hence resulting in some uncertainties The aim is to accommodate as much information as possible in the system instead of creating a high-quality information repository Similar to Dataspaces high-quality information can be obtained using a pay-as-you-go model over the data of interest C Understanding Query Semantics We need to understand user intent from the queries to provide the best matching results This calls for a rich query language capable of expressing that intent Semantic Web query languages e.g SPARQL should be tailored to express important aspects including spatial temporal textual and relational While some of these features are supported others e.g structured keyword and meta-data queries are not efìciently supported The system should disambiguate a query to nd its true meaning Linked Data provides the necessary constructs that can help understand true user intent III P ROPOSAL Fig 1 Knowledge Cubes The Big Picture Initially a knowledge cube is created based on one or more semantic aspect such as topical contextual spatial or temporal For example a knowledge cube can focus on a sport topical a library in a university contextual a country spatial the stone age temporal or a combination of these or other semantic aspects Then the knowledge cube extracts relevant information based on its own semantic aspects from existing Linked Data datasets This creates a notion of specialization based on the rich Linked Data information at the cube level The data extracted should conform to Linked Data principles and should be stored in the RDF model The cube fetches further resources from the Web of Data that matches the cubeês semantics Once a query is issued a cube-aware server identiìes which knowledge cube is suitable to answer the query If a knowledge cube needs further information in order to disambiguate or enhance the query answer it communicates with other knowledge cubes Figure 1 illustrates the big picture of querying the system IV F OUNDING P RINCIPLES In this section we present the founding principles that guide the knowledge cubes architecture 


A Structural Evolution As in Figure 1 a knowledge cube captures the notion of specialization be it spatial temporal topical contextual or otherwise Its granularity level adapts to represent ner grained knowledge cubes For example the Sports knowledge cube can be broken into multiple cubes e.g Basketball and Baseball These two sub-cubes would still be inter-linked together This inter-linking is important as it can provide more insightful information For example an interesting relationship would be that Michael Jordan who is a Basketball player and hence belonging to the Basketball cube has a played relationship with the Baseball cube This means that the decoupling of information does not mean breaking some relationships but instead decouples the main information into partitions This structural evolution creates space to accumulate further information relevant to the semantics of the cube on both sides that in turn provides scalability to the whole system.It also allows minimizing the communication overhead between knowledge cubes We refer to this behavior as the structural evolution of a knowledge cube A knowledge cube may evolve based on its newly attained size or semantic aspect by re-partitioning dynamically in an unsupervised fashion The evolution of knowledge cubes involves a number of aspects 1 Merging and Splitting  where a cube merges or splits based on the semantic aspects e.g sports into basketball and football or vice versa 2 Arbitration and Prioritization  where a knowledge cube gives precedence to certain structural changes based on the overall status of the system The structural evolution leads to the creation of further specialized cubes that are capable of learning more insightful information relating to their semantic aspects The semantics of user queries also dictates if there is a need for a structural evolution in case it forces the system to contact more than one knowledge cube B Temporal Evolution A knowledge cube organizes it own data temporally using a time-roadmap  The time-roadmap can be identiìed by 1 the entities involved in the data units 2 the timestamps of the data units and 3 the relationships of the entities involved and their respective time-span For example a user may be interested in a query related to the activities of the U.S president who held ofìce during a speciìc time-span The time-roadmap will display entries for all the U.S presidents that held ofìce in that time period in addition to any activities that they performed that overlap with the requested time-span Knowledge cubes operate on Linked Data that originate from well-structured data that progressively evolve over time using other structured or unstructured data Each data unit or entity has a belief value degree of truthfulness associated with it C Analytic Distribution An important principle is the distribution of the analytic load across multiple knowledge cubes and then communicating the results back according to relevance The analytic load is composed of extracting the data determining its level of uncertainty and linking it with the existing Linked Data in the cube The advantage of distributing the analytic load is to allow for the simpliìcation in development and maintenance The knowledge cube approach is orthogonal to the data cube approach in as kno wledge cubes focus on one speciìc dimension only Also the knowledge cubeês RDF data model allows it to support graph-based analytics e.g random walks regular expression and reachability queries distance oracles and community searches V S TRAWMAN D ESIGN In this section we present a strawman design of the components needed for the realization of knowledge cubes A Cube-awareness This component is responsible for making a knowledge cube aware of all the other cubes relevant to it Cube-awareness provides structural or data-level updates to the hosting cube This component guarantees to the hosting instance the most updated information that other cubes possess The cubeawareness component appears in two states 1 the standalone state where it resides on a cube-aware server so that when it receives a userês query it forwards the query to the appropriate knowledge cube and 2 the Embedded state where the cube-aware component provides each knowledge cube with the necessary information regarding other relevant knowledge cubes Relevance among knowledge cubes is deìned by the set of common relations they share These relations are deìned based on the Linked Data of each cube B Catalog The catalog maintains all the information related to the data sources it fetches It maintains a list of the data elements that each source captures For example each catalog maintains a list of all named entities e.g countries people buildings etc for each source In contrast to Dataspaces the catalog maintains information about the other knowledge cubes catalogs Knowledge cubes coordinate with each other the content acquired in order to maximize partitioning and hence increase their specialization A cube-aware server acts as a dispatcher for data sources where it indicates to each knowledge cube what data source to handle The catalog addresses the variety aspect of Big Data Each cube fetches heterogeneous data sources related to the cubeês semantic focus For example a news source publishes an article that can also be discussed over social media channels e.g twitter or facebook Exhibiting this behavior over multiple specialized cubes each with its separate view of heterogeneity allows introducing variety into the knowledge cube C Information Extraction This component employs text analysis techniques in order to extract and learn from structured and unstructured sources Systems e.g NELL contain a free-te xt e x tractor termed Coupled Pattern Learner CPL that couples the semisupervised training of extractors of different categories and 


relations NELL is capable of extracting patterns in the form of X playsIn Y and president of X Given the architecture of knowledge cubes we suggest that such extractors could be trained with the initial Linked Data of the cube since the training patterns are similar to the RDF model of Linked Data We believe that having an extractor per cube with an initial limited set of ne-tuned labeled data that evolves over time should lead to a better extraction accuracy for the cube rather than a globally trained extractor Unlik e N ELL 7 our proposed extraction patterns rely on the structural evolution of the cube and not on the initial seed only The Information Extraction component tackles the veracity aspect of Big Data The use of Linked Data creates a rich platform for understanding the query and thus creating added value out of the underlying data The veracity of the identiìed entities has to be veriìed before it can be used for generating valuable results or linked to existing data D Search and Querying This component provides a rich set of constructs that understand the semantics of the query terms speciìed by the user A knowledge cube uses its underlying Linked Data in order to disambiguate and discover interesting relations that in turn provides more insight to the results The search and querying component supports search-based methods that include keyword textual spatial temporal and semantic-based methods that rely on similarity functions and database-level methods For example we need to understand the semantics of queries like Seafood restaurant by the ocean or Cafe with a view on the Eiffel tower The query is converted into a triple that is matched against the knowledge cubes data that is also formatted as triples The search and querying component is responsible for determining the best possible way to communicate with other cubes to satisfy the user query This requires understanding the communication topology and determining the best routing technique to minimize query time The search and querying component tackles the value aspect of Big Data The use of Linked Data creates a rich platform for understanding the query and thus creating added value out of the underlying data E Data Store and Indexing An integral component that deìnes the feasibility of the knowledge cubes architecture is the storage and indexing mechanisms over the Linked Data We need highly efìcient and scalable storage and indexing mechanisms that can operate over billions of RDF triples that are available over the Web of Data Various data stores have been proposed that include native relational or hybrid data stores Using the semantic aspects can aid in creating efìcient storage schemes given the RDF data model Existing proposals need to be modiìed to consider this aspect Another integral factor in the knowledge cubes architecture is its ability to answer queries without accessing the actual data sources This requires having a descriptive and up-to-date index in order to satisfy the userês query Given that each cube indexes its own data the index needs to maintain information about what other cubes are capable of providing and what can aid in satisfying the user query Another aspect is the ability of the index to create efìcient associations among data objects of different sources for the same cube Query Optimization provide facilities e.g query simpliìcation indexing and operator implementations Interesting operators include spatio-temporal top results SPARQL 1.1 provides rich facilities that allo w f urther optimization by having no centralized coordinating unit for query evaluation between sources Similar to Dataspaces in knowledge cubes there will be support for high availability and recovery the ability to trace back to the origin of a token e.g from a text le an XML le etc caching by building additional indexes to support efìcient access caching for generalization of join index token appears in multiple data sources caching to reduce the query load on participants that cannot allow adhoc external queries The data store and indexing components tackle the volume and velocity aspects of Big Data respectively The proposed architecture for knowledge cubes suggests that learning semantics should allow the storage and indexing to scale better than a centralized or distributed mechanism that do not consider the semantics of the data  Neglecting the scalability factor incurs a higher overhead on the index and incurs a rise in the communication overhead within the distributed system F Discovery of Data Sources Each knowledge cube can have its own discovery mechanism for the list of Big Data sources relevant to its semantic aspects One source that indexes Linked Data is Sindice where it provides relevancy over its indexed Linked Data sources based on the Universal Resource Identiìer URI or the keyword-based query Sindice only indexes sources that conform with Linked Data formats Knowledge cubes can use a web search engine to search for relevant web sources that match the semantic aspects of a cube This is done by issuing a keyword-based search query with keywords that best describe a cube One method of determining these keywords can be by using the most frequent ones that appear in the data that the cube holds The knowledge cube uses the interlinking of relevant documents to retrieve further information that is relevant to that document and to the cube The Data Sources Discovery component is responsible for maintaining and creating relationships among data sources and locating new Big Data sources in a semi-supervised fashion It is also capable of proposing new relationships Data Sources and Discovery will also monitor the contents of the cube and propose additional relationships over time G Data Sources Update and Extension Given an initial seed of RDFês the time-roadmap is responsible for maintaining the updates for the data in the cube If new information is identiìed and it relates to existing RDF 


entries a time-oriented snapshot is taken and amended to the current RDF The time-roadmap guarantees freshness of the results by providing or linking information with the latest updates found from sources The newly acquired data is integrated in an unsupervised manner based on the characteristics of the current RDF data This data includes the subjects that can help guide the acquisition process For example in the news domain we may have a cube representing the Presidents of the United States In this case the RDF entities can be the names of Presidents and can further be used to harvest all information from Big Data sources related to US presidents We can integrate newly discovered information and entities that relate to the initial set of identiìed Presidents based on how much this information is coupled This will require that the cube perform text analysis on the data to determine the entities involved and then determine whether the identiìed information relates to the Linked Data of the cube or not This information can also be shared with other knowledge cubes that may nd this analyzed information of relevance Similar to Dataspaces this component can amend data sources that have limited capabilities with additional ones such as schema catalog keyword search and update monitoring This allo ws the heterogeneous sources to share similar services thus allowing the system to harness their information VI C HALLENGES This section presents common challenges that knowledge cubes share with the Web of Data Also we indicate a set of new challenges that are spawned from the knowledge cubes architecture We demonstrate how the knowledge cubes architecture can be used to address these challenges A Challenge 1 Semantic Interpretation A key issue in learning on Big Data scale lies in understanding the true meaning of the data This is known as semantic interpretation  It deals with the interpretation of ambiguous or imprecise data Web-scale data is believed to be part of the solution Gi v e n t he amount of a v ailable structured data it can resolve semantic heterogeneity We share the same view as the one in that the challenge lies in choosing a representation that can use unsupervised learning over plenty of unlabeled data rather than relying on limited labeled data The semantic interpretation challenge is also apparent in the spatial dimension One study proposes a set of semantic features derived from web contextual information to create a location disambiguation system for identiìed locations Although the study illustrates that the system achieves better results than the state-of-the-art industrial systems it still does not operate well over heterogeneous data sources Knowledge cubes can provide a rich platform for semantic aspects that can enhance information extraction systems with features to efìciently disambiguate locations The proposed knowledge cubes architecture deals primarily with a heterogeneous set of Big Data sources that may not include any structure or labeled annotations to start with Knowledge cubes need to rely on aspects beyond the labeled data in order to correctly interpret the data We believe that endorsing semantic aspects in the architecture of the knowledge cubes can provide an interesting platform for tackling this challenge For example using the spatial aspect we can disambiguate identiìed organizations or people in a document or query based on other entities identiìed in the same context and we can use the relations of the cube to disambiguate the identiìed entities further B Challenge 2 Uncertainty Even with highly accurate named-entity extraction and disambiguation systems there is a need to attach a truth value to the extracted data This allows the system to select the most reliable information to present in response to a user query This issue is vital when new data is linked to existing data in the cube We need to attach data with a speciìc uncertainty value Reynolds presents se v eral aspects to the uncertainty challenge One aspect is the ambiguity resulting from Linking date where the same identiìed entities occurring in different datasets do not have the same universal resource identiìer URI Datasets use an imperfect mechanism namely the owl:sameAs relation to co-reference similar entities with heuristic weighting The same challenge exists in knowledge cubes speciìcally when an entity is identiìed and needs to be linked to existing identiìers Knowledge cubes extend this challenge further with regards to entities that map into multiple cubes The question becomes Which cube should the entity belong to The owl:sameAs relation is one mean of having the entity mentioned in two cubes In this case the relation can act as a connector for both This raises a bigger concern of duplication of entities across cubes The precision of certain values for entities is another important aspect F o r e xample one entity may ha v e an attribute e.g population captured at different time-spans that is derived from various readings This raises the concern that when entities are merged there can be a conîict in values and hence affecting the merging process One way is to use the time-roadmap of a knowledge cube to track the attribute value changes over time A challenge that this suggestion raises is what is the best way to represent a time-roadmap and which attributes are to be maintained We need techniques to identify time-related events upon which the time-roadmap can be built that also may need to consider other factors e.g the spatial aspect We need to maintain an uncertainty value for the attribute in case the event does not include an explicitly speciìed date and should be implied from the event e.g World War 2 There is also uncertainty associated with the data source This issue is apparent in the Linked Data settings especially given the cross linking and the absence of provisioning In turn this raises the concern of veracity of the included data source We suggest that knowledge cubes include wellestablished provisioning mechanisms in the catalog component in order to tackle this issue 


In Re ynolds suggests that the data source selection process should be selective in terms of the data needed Given the scale of the data handled by the knowledge cubes architecture the proposed suggestion by Reynolds aligns with knowledge cubes Reynolds suggests two types of vocabularies to express the data 1 Link vocabulary to provide a common representation for links and 2 Imprecise value vocabulary to provide a common representation for common vocabulary Given the knowledge cubes architecture the vocabulary proposal by Reynolds can be a viable solution where each cube includes its own vocabulary However we need to allow for cross-talk e.g by maintaining relations among existing vocabulary terms from the various vocabularies and providing enough provisioning in order for the relations to still hold The spatial and temporal dimensions of the knowledge cube data form a rich facility in solving some uncertainty challenges For example we can disambiguate two named entities if both belong to the same spatial location or time slot C Challenge 3 Data Partitioning Scheme Deìning an efìcient scheme for partitioning depends on the semantics of the data For example speciìc snapshots of the data may mandate that the data be partitioned according to the named entities contained in the data Another scheme might see that partitioning based on people who are politicians or soccer players might generate a good scheme More sophisticated schemes might involve both entities and relations or a combination of both An important aspect to consider is how big the data is given each scheme and whether there is a form of overlapping among the generated partitions We believe that the data is the main driver of the partitioning scheme Employing some form of data analysis over the acquired data may reveal interesting properties that can aid in deìning efìcient partitioning schemes For example semantic relationships can be learned in an unsupervised fashion from the search queries and their results This means that the statistics gathered based on user queries can be an asset that aids in identifying an efìcient partitioning scheme In turn this requires that the system starts with an initial scheme that can evolve over time based on gathered statistics D Challenge 4 Storage and Indexing The database and semantic web communities have a number of solutions for storing and querying Linked Data ranging from centralized to distributed data stores W e describe four main categories that have been adopted by both communities and discuss the challenges associated with each of them The rst category called Triplestores stores RDF triples in a single relational table The attributes speciìed are either triples subject predicate object or quadruples subject predicate object context Even though disk space for Triplestores is not a major concern in terms of size a real concern is in maintaining a reasonable RAM and database ratio which is exempliìed in the case of Big Data scale The second category is vertically-partitioned tables where systems maintain a table per property as many triple patterns have xed properties One variation is to use a column store that captures the column entries of the same type The objective is to avoid reading an entire row into memory in the event that only a few attributes are accessed per query This approach has scalability problems when the number of properties in an RDF is high 23 The study in 22 23 suggests that Triplestores outperform the vertically-partitioned approach when having a larger number of properties The third category is schema-speciìc systems that capture subjects with overlapping properties These systems have a query processing advantage as the subjects may be accessed together In  Le v andoski and Mokbel claim that property tables can outperform Triplestores and vertically-partitioned tables for RDF data One concern is the storage overhead because subjects may contain multiple objects The second and third categories also raise an important concern regarding the increased cost of integration quality An open question is Which of the three categories is best suited for embodying the semantic aspects proposed by the knowledge cubes architecture One proposed direction is to adopt all three categories and apply the most optimum based on the current semantics of the data This step occurs as the knowledge cube evolves over time Deìning a suitable index over the data is also a crucial challenge An index may need to include spatial temporal relational or textual aspects An advantage of knowledge cubes is that the index would be deìned over well-structured information with rich semantics In turn this aids in deìning a more meaningful indexing structure The structural integrity of the index would also affect the query processing performance E Challenge 5 Communication among Cubes There are many forms of communication in knowledge cubes One is when a cube needs to know further information about a query that it is processing Another is when a cube needs to be updated about what other cubes have Deìning an efìcient communication protocol that considers the overhead of contacting and retrieving content from other knowledge cubes is vital Knowledge cubes may co-exist on the same machine i.e embedded communication or on separate machines i.e stand-alone A knowledge cube should be intelligent enough to decide when to cache content that it usually retrieves from other knowledge cubes In turn this should signiìcantly decrease the communication overhead Adaptive Replacement Cache ARC is one candidate algorithm that can be used to keep track of frequently used and recently used data It can also be used to maintain historical data regarding eviction for both scenarios A challenge would be to see if the algorithm will adapt to both data and structural evolution of the knowledge cube F Challenge 6 Spatial and Temporal Extraction Published articles or web pages will need to be segmented into individual units of information termed statements For each statement we need to identify the topic of the statement 


the subject the person the event the time interval or the location that this statement is about who authored the sentence where and when this statement is made and whether that statement is extracted from some other internet source etc For example in the time dimension we need to capture two notions of time for a given statement 1 when that statement is published or written i.e its transaction time and 2 when the facts in the statement took place i.e its valid time The same applies for the space dimension Two space dimensions need to be extracted 1 the physical location of the person who published the statement i.e the statementês transaction location and 2 the location where the facts in the statement took place i.e its valid location The same is true for the person who wrote the statement and the person that the statement states facts about etc G Challenge 7 Data Change Frequency It is important to identify when a knowledge cube updates its Linked Data Linked Data is very dynamic in nature where its resources are added removed or updated very frequently especially in the Web of Data Therefore it is important to investigate measures of freshness for the content and interlinked resources For example the Linked Data of the cube may indicate certain properties for triples that might conîict with others that are later retrieved as new data Identifying these conîicts and creating policies of how to handle them is a crucial issue Adding provenance can be one solution to this issue However it raises another question of what version of the data to present as an answer to the query A study by Umbrich et al identiìes the characteristics of change over Linked Data and compares the change frequency in the Web of Data versus the traditional Web HTML documents  VII C ONCLUSION We present a vision for the knowledge cube architecture that motivates understanding the semantics of the data as a means for solving some of the research challenges we face today speciìcally in Big Data We motivate the use of Linked Data as a mean for achieving this target given the rich semantics that Linked Data provides We present a strawman design that sketches the possible components of a knowledge cubes system Each presented component conveys a high-level overview about its potential usage scenarios We illustrate some of the challenges and potential solutions associated with the knowledge cubes proposal Finally we demonstrate how the proposed architectural components can be used to tackle the ve pillars of Big Data A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was

   9 extreme radiation environment could induce faults i n these components that can only be cleared by the removal and reapplication of power termed off-pulsing The FM S implements an off-pulsing architecture that provide s offpulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transce iver IEM and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earthís orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraftís orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the missionís product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
