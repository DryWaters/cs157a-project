In this paper, an approach based on association rule and knowledge base is proposed and implemented in the fault diagnosis of a transformer system. According to the features of association rule, the Apriori algorithm is adopted and modified to generate decision rules from power transformer information for building knowledge base, then the rules can be refined to diagnose the fault of the transformer through reasoning, and a prototype system is developed. This approach based on association rule is described in detail and the application is illustrated by an example. A comparison with the IEC International Electrotechnical Commission\hree-ratio method shows the proposed method can provide better accuracy in performance KeywordsApriori; association rule mining; knowledge base; dissolved gas analysis; fault diagnosis; power transformer I I NTRODUCTION The power transformer is a major apparatus in a power system. Transformer faults have caused huge economic losses and brought about adverse social impacts in the past Early diagnosis to detect the incipient faults is necessary to avoiding catastrophic failures and costly outages To a large extent, the gas component and content dissolved in the transformer oil indicate the insulation aging and fault degree of the transformer, so the diagnosis of oilimmersed transformers using the dissolved gas analysis DGA\technique has been well accepted and widely used and various methods applied for the DGA have been developed to interpret DGA results such as IEC ratio code and the Rogers method [2  th e i r  lim itati o n  is th at  th e  predefined criteria are established upon empirical studies. In some cases, measured gas concentrations or ratios may be incomplete and thus do not fit within the predefined criteria As a result, faults that occur inside transformers may not be identifiable. Other methods include rough sets theory [3  fuzzy theory [5,6 u p p o r t  v ect or m ach in e 7  ar tif ic ial  neural network [8 1 1 Ba y e si a n  ne t w o r k [1 2  g r e y  relational analysis [13  ex ten s i on th e o ry 1 4  f u z z y en tro py  15  C a s e b as ed R e as on in g  T h eo ry 1 6   d ecis ion tr ee  1 7    Kernel-Based Possibilistic Clustering [18  Ex p e rt Sy stem  19 an d h y bri d m e t h ods   2 0][2 4    al l  of t h es e m e th ods h a v e  been developed to improve diagnosis accuracies. However these methods sometimes fail to determine the fault type, and the workers onsite often use different methods or other related information about the transformer to do such judge fault. Therefore, exploring new ways to resolve this early warning problem is still a challenge Association rule mining \(ARM\ne of the data mining techniques used to extract hidden knowledge from data sets, which can be used by an organization's decision makers to improve overall profit  A R M bas ed DG A approach [2 a s been pres en ted to f a u lt dia g n o sis of power transformers, the result shows the approach is capable of generating a number of meaningful association rules and can achieve higher fault diagnosis accuracy, but owing to small number of samples used, more experiments are expected to examine it ARM-based methods are applied in many fields. For customer relationship management \(CRM\, the technical analysis of customer using association rules can show the buying behavior, so that the managers of supermarket can adjust the layout of products to improve their services and profits. In the financial field, association rules technology is used in banking, securities, insurance, etc. and has discovered some important rules to support business decisions. In addition, the association rules technique also applies to the life sciences, information technology industrial control, network security and so on 737 978-1-4244-8136-1/10/$26.00 c  2010 IEEE 


For an oil-immersed power transformer, during the past forty years, dissolved gas analysis \(DGA\has become universally accepted as the premier diagnostic tool for location of incipient faults in transformers with an assumption based on the idea that the gases produced during normal operation of oil filled circuit breakers \(OCB\ or load tap changers \(LTC\ would be more significant than gases produced by a fault process such as contact overheating Therefore, there should be some association between the fault \(the working state\ and the dissolved gases In this study, we not only examine the diagnosis accuracy of ARM-based DGA approach [26 a l s o w e f o cu s  on h o w to  incorporate knowledge base with ARM-based DGA to build a fault diagnosis system. This ARM-based approach consists of a rule discovery method modified by the Apriori algorithm [27 an d a ru l e b as ed k n ow ledg e s y s t em 28  29   for diagnosis of the power transformer fault. A comparison with the IEC three-ratio method is implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A knowledge base is established for incorporating more useful rules This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the concepts and notions of information tables, association rule and knowledge base. Based on these basic concepts and notions, Section III presents an association rule and knowledge-base approach, including how to pre-process the data, how to modify the Apriori algorithm to generate rules and refine them, and how to use rules to diagnose the fault of a transformer. In Section IV, a case based example illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed association rule approach in comparison with IEC three-ratio method. Conclusions and future work are provided in Section V II B ASIC N OTIONS A Information tables and decision tables In general, an information table is a system to express knowledge which can be used to represent and process knowledge in machine learning, data mining and other related fields The definitions of information table and decision table have been described in [27  A decision table is a special case of an information table A decision table can be seen as a special and important knowledge expression system. It shows that, when some conditions are satisfied, decisions, actions, operations, or controls can be made. Decision attributes in a decision table may, or may not, be unique. In the latter case, the decision table can be converted to one with unique decision attributes. Therefore, in this paper, we assume that there is only one decision attribute In this paper, an information table has the form of a decision table with condition attributes C including the key gases \(e.g. hydrogen \(H 2 ethane \(CH 4 ethene \(C 2 H 6  ethylene \(C 2 H 4 ylene \(C 2 H 2 d decision attributes D called çthe working stateé. This table contains the fault records as raw data for extracting rules for diagnosis B Association rule Let D the task-relevant data be a set of database transactions where each transaction T is a set of items where each transaction is associated with an identifier, called TID  Let A be a set of itemsets An association rule is an implication of the form A  B  where A I  B I and A B    The rule A  B holds in the transaction set D with support s where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain A B This is taken to be the probability P \(A B The rule A  B has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B This is taken to be the conditional probability P  B|A hat is support A  B  P  A B nfidence A  B  B  A  Rules that satisfy both a minimum support threshold min_sup\d a minimum confidence threshold \(min_conf are called strong rules. If an itemset satisfies minimum support, then it is a frequent itemset Ap is a classical alg o r ith m to f i n d asso ciatio n  rules of item-set, which mines frequent itemsets by using a circulatory method to search frequent itemsets that produces  k  1 item-sets from k item-sets. After scanning the database, the algorithm begins to circulate. Each time, it connects two k 1 msets, and produces frequent k itemsets after the riddling of Apriori property, that is çeach subsets of the frequent itemsets also should be frequenté as well as the minimum support degree. The Apriori ends till the frequent itemsets canêt be produced The procedure using Apriori algorithm can be described as follows For each frequent item-sets L produces all subsets For each non-null subset S of L generates an association rule s  l s it's confidence degree is not less than min_conf This is the classic algorithm for association rules. In this paper, we modify this method in order to build the knowledge base of an expert system C Knowledge base Knowledge base is a product of artificial intelligence and database technology, also a collection of knowledge and data. The keys to the development of technology are the knowledge acquisition, knowledge storage and representation, knowledge reasoning 1\ Knowledge acquisition Knowledge acquisition is a process whereby the knowledge from external knowledge sources is converted to the knowledge-based system. The object of knowledge acquisition, including the knowledge of domain experts and other relevant knowledge, must go through a refining process to improve problem-solving abilities The means of knowledge acquisition usually contains two methods, which are interactive access and natural language acquisition. In this paper, the rules will be obtained by association rule, and then processed to become knowledge by a domain expert The rules above are based on support and confidence which are objective assessment of conditions. These rules must be processed by subjective evaluation with domain knowledge, to then become useful knowledge 738 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 


After knowledge acquisition, the rules can be stored in the knowledge base, and then used to diagnose by reasoning 2\ Knowledge storage and representation To place the knowledge into the knowledge Base, it needs a variable table and the rule table established  Variable table: In this study, we choose H 2 CH 4  C 2 H 6 C 2 H 4 C 2 H 2 as the variables of the knowledge base, more variables can be added  Rule table: Through establishing rule table, we can carry reasoning process by matching the rules with the facts \(the variable bound values The representation of knowledge contains the first order predicates logic, production rule for semantic network production rule representation, and frame theory representation and so on. In this study, production rule representation is the best choice to express the knowledge The form of this method is P Q  Variable is the basic unit of the rules. In a relational database, each variable is a record in the table, and the attributes are the fields in the database. The fields are as shown in Table I TABLE I F IE L DS OF VARIABLE TABLE Fields Type Explain  VariableID Integer Number of variables Chinesename Text Chinese name of variables Englishname Text English name, Represent the variables in the expression values Max Float The max of variable values Min Float The min of variable values H 2 CH 4 C 2 H 4 C 2 H 2 C 2 H 6 are the variables with No. 0 1, 2, 3 and 4. Max and Min denote the maximal value and minimal value, the gas data between Max and Min is valid Rule table is the basis for problem solving, and their knowledge of the integrity, consistency, accuracy flexibility, and the rationality of knowledge organization has an important impact on the operating efficiency of the system. The fields of the rule table are shown in Table II 3\Knowledge reasoning In this study, we use forward reasoning for inference. After the user inputs the gas values of a new power transformer, the reasoning process is as follows First, bind corresponding variables  with these values by searching the variable table \(Table I\ith the known facts Secondly, match antecedents of each rule \(Table II against known facts to produce a set of applicable rules Finally, choose one applicable rules to apply \(e.g. first rule which produces new facts\, adding new facts to the fact-base TABLE II F IE L DS OF RULE TABLE Fields Type Explain Ruleid Integer Number of variables Cls_variableid Text The condition variables Clause_vars Text The antecedent variables separated by comma Opts Text Determine symbols  Decidevalues Text Determine value, separated by comma Expression Text Explanation of rules III T HE P ROPOSED A PPROACH B ASED O N A SSOCIATION R ULE A ND K NOWLEDGE B ASE In this section, a proposed approach based on association rule and knowledge base is described, and the procedure of the approach is given in detail To use association rules for transformer fault diagnosis we need to choose the most representative attributes of variables and collect data records, then pre-process them to be suitable for using ARM. Refined rules generated by ARM will be stored in the knowledge base, and when a new power transformerês DGA record is provided, the rules in knowledge will be used to diagnose the working state of the power transformer by reasoning. The workflow chart of the approach is shown in Fig.1 Figure 1 The workflow chart Some steps are detailed as follows A. Pre-process data In the real world, incomplete, noisy, and inconsistent data are common in the data we wish to analyze, so the first thing we should do is data pre-processing Data pre-processing includes data cleaning, data integration, data transformation, and data reduction  Data reduction obtains a reduced representation of the data set that is much smaller in volume, yet produces the same \(or almost the same\alytical results. There are a number of strategies for data reduction, such as data cube aggregation, attribute subset selection, dimensionality reduction, numerosity reduction, and discretization can be used to obtain a reduced representation of the data while minimizing the loss of information content. Data discretization is a form of data reduction that is very useful for the automatic generation of concept hierarchies from numerical data Data discretization techniques can be used to reduce the number of values for a given continuous attribute by dividing the range of the attribute into intervals. Interval labels can then be used to replace actual data values 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 739 


Replacing numerous values of a continuous attribute by a small number of interval labels thereby reduces and simplifies the original data. This leads to a concise, easy-touse, knowledge-level representation of mining results In this study, we will use a rough set and boolean reasoning approach [3 o s o lv e th i s of real v a lu e attribu te s  quantity problem, the approach has been verified for its ability of improving classification and accepted widely in practice The values of each gas are divided into several intervals and different gases have different number of intervals B. Generate Rules by Modified Apriori algorithm In the Apriori algorithm, two frequent k-1 item are usually linked if they have the same front k-2 ms. For example, from link ç1.3, 2.1, 3.1, 4.2, 5.2, 6.1é and ç1.3 2.1, 3.1, 4.2, 5.1, 6.1é, we can get ç1.3, 2.1, 3.1, 4.2, 5.1 5.2, 6.1é. However, this is not, in fact, reasonable, because 5.1é and ç5.2é are two possible values of the same attribute,so they canêt exist simultaneously.  In our approach, we modify the link rules, if  two frequent k-1  item have the same front k-2 ms and their k-1 items arenêt possible values of the same attribute, we link them After the linking work and the set of the min_sup, we get the frequent k-itemsets which satisfies both min_conf and min_sup. From the above example, we get the frequent 5itemsets finally, as shown in Table III TABLE III EXAMPLE T HE FREQUENT 5ITEMSETS Item Support  1.5, 2.3, 4.3, 5.4, 6.1 4 1.5, 3.3, 4.3, 5.4, 6.1 5 1.6, 2.2, 3.2, 4.3, 6.2 6 1.6, 2.2, 4.3, 5.5, 6.2 4 1.6, 2.3, 3.3, 4.3, 6.1 5 1.6, 2.3, 3.4, 4.3, 6.1 6 1.6, 2.3, 4.3, 5.2, 6.1 5 1.6, 3.2, 4.3, 5.4, 6.2 4 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.5, 6.2 4 2.2, 3.2, 4.3, 5.5, 6.2 4 2.3, 3.3, 4.3, 5.4, 6.1 6 2.3, 3.4, 4.3, 5.4, 6.1 4 In the classic association algorithm, for all non-null subsets of frequent itemsets L and each nominal subset S  we produce an association rule s  l-s its confidence degree is not less than min_conf For the knowledge base, the expected result by ARM is that these rules with some condition attributes are contained in antecedents with a decision attribute in consequents, but not all of the association rules like this. We modified this part of Apriori to obtain these expected rules. According to the important feature that the non-frequent itemsetsê subset is also non-frequent, we only need to calculate the confidence degree of the subset except for the consequent of decision rule. For example, to the frequent itemsets ç1.5 2.3, 4.3, 5.4, 6.1é, we only need to calculate the confidence degree of ç1.5, 2.3, 4.3, 5.4é, that is, s= ç1.5, 2.3, 4.3, 5.4 Because 6.1 is the consequent of decision rule\when it satisfies the rule that its confidence is more than min_conf we can produce the rule s  l-s 1.5, 2.3, 4.3 5.4 6.1 C. Refine Rules and add rules for knowledge base In Section B, through the ARM process, we find a lot of rules, but not every rule is appropriate, so we need to check them to keep the desired rules. In this study, this post process work is undertaken by a domain expert or knowledge worker The rules generated by ARM will not be enough for diagnosis, and some empirical rules from on-site inspection are also useful, so using a knowledge base could be more extendable and feasible in practice, as we can input those empirical rules into the knowledge base D. Diagnose fault using rules The reasoning is mainly achieved by rule matching Once a DGA record data or related data of a power transformer is provided, these values will be bound with corresponding variables and enter the reasoning process described in the knowledge reasoning section. After that, the fault type of the provided power transformer will be determined IV A C ASE S TUDY A case study using the proposed approach is presented in this paper, including fault and normal data of power transformers, 127 training data sets is selected randomly for generating rules, and other 73 test data sets are used to validate the proposed approach using the obtained rules As we mentioned above, DGA records are chosen in this study, including the five dissolved gases: H 2 CH 4 C 2 H 6  C 2 H 4 C 2 H 2 Table IV shows an excerpt of raw data TABLE IV AN E XCERPT OF RAW DATA Discretization is the main task in processing data.

During this process, a domain expert evaluates the generated rules and decides the rules to be kept by their domain knowledge and empirical evidence.

Once a new set of key gas values of a power transformer is provided, we can diagnose the working state of the power transformer by matching the rules in the knowledge base. Fig.2. shows an interface of fault diagnosis Figure 2 Fault diagnosis based on knowledge base To validate the proposed approach, we used the IEC three-ratio method to diagnose the fault of power transformers with the same test data sets. The IEC threeratio method is widely accepted and used in on-site work, so the comparison basically can show the performance of the proposed method. The proposed approach using the refined rules in Table VI diagnosed 73 test data sets and the IEC three-ratio method also is used for comparision, the results shown in Table VII From Table VII, we can see that the proposed approach using association rule achieved higher accuracy in each fault type, especially for hyperthermia and superheating, the accuracy reached 100%, although itês expected to be identified by more experiments TABLE VII C OMPARISON RESULTS Fault type Number of Samples Accuracy Three-Ratio The proposed approach Normal 33 81.8 90.9 Hyperthermia and superheating 10 80.0 100.0 High energy discharging 10 70.0 90.0 Low energy discharging 10 70.0 80.0 Medium temperature and superheating 10 80.0 80.0 Total 73 78.1 89.0 V C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK Power transformer fault is a complicated problem and the development of related research is important. This poses a challenge, for which we proposed an approach based on ARM and the knowledge base.

matched to diagnose the fault. The results of comparison with the IEC three-ratio method show that the use of association rules for fault diagnosis is feasible and generates better performance. Moreover, the application of the knowledge base is useful to incorporate empirical results of field experts or other resources Our future work includes developing some methods to assist domain expert to refine the rules process, and to find rule selection technologies to use the rules in the knowledge base appropriately and solve the rule contradictions. Future work will consider more related information and collect more fault records about power transformers; so that we can better improve the result of ARM R EFERENCES 1 I EEE I EEE G u ide f o r the  I n te r p r e tatio n o f G a se s G e ne r a te d in O i l  Immersed Transformers, standard ed.

Figure 3 Precision-recall curve in ROI-250 image dataset 5.3 Experiment 3 Mammograms-1080 image dataset This experiment employed a dataset composed by 1080 mammograms images collected in the Clinical Hospital of University of Sao Paulo at Ribeiro Preto The dataset was previously classi\002ed into 4 levels of breast tissue density 0501\051 mostly fatty 050362 images\051 0502\051 partly fatty 050446 images\051 0503\051 partly dense 050200 images\051 and 0504\051 mostly dense 05072 images\051 Figure 4 Precision-recall curve in Mammography-1080 image dataset Breast density is an important risk factor in the development of breast cancer In this experiment the images are represented by the feature set proposed in b uilding a vector of 85 features including shape and size of the breast the conditions of the breast contour nipple position and the distribution of 002broglandular tissue This dataset was divided in training set and test set The training set is composed of 720 images and test set is composed of 360 images Figure 4 shows the P&R curves over test dataset and also the number of features selected in each method Again the proposed methods reached the highest values of precision and select the smallest number of features 050a\051 050b\051 050c\051 050d\051 Figure 5 Queries in Mammography dataset 050a\051 226 is the query image 050b\051 using the features selected through 002tness function F cB  050c\051 using the features selected through classi\002cation error of C4.5 and 050d\051 using the all features extracted Results for the retrieval of the 5 most similar images from a query image are also provided in this experiment as illustrated in Figure 5 The image 5.\050a\051 is the query image taken from the mostly fatty image class Images shown in 5.\050b\051 are the 5 most similar images retrieved for the proposed 002tness function F cB  The row 050c\051 shows the results for C 4  5 classi\002er whereas 050d\051 illustrate the images resulting from all features 050no selection applied\051 In Figure 5 the images surrounded by dashed lines are false positives 050not relevant images\051 For this query the proposed method achieved the highest precision 050100%\051 when compared the results of C4.5 and the original feature vector 050precision of 40%\051 


6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
