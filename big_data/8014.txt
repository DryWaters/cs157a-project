Dan Tao et al Load Feedback-Based Resource Scheduling and Dynamic Migration-Based Data Locality for    157 Fig 10 The load averages of multiple physical hosts in the DHCI architecture 70  as a threshold Similarly when the load average exceeds this threshold the workload of the physical host is regarded as severe This striking trend in Fig 7 shows that when a physical host's workload rises and exceeds the preset threshold other physical hosts in the same virtual cluster will take part in workload balancing and thus improve the ef\002ciency Figures 9 and 10 give the performance parameters CPU utility rate CPU for short as well as the load average LA for short of 4 physical hosts during a period of 14 minutes for two different architectures We take their averages for each physical host respectively as illustrated in Figs 11 and 12 Then we calculate their variances to re\003ect the 003uctuations in workload of multiple physical hosts The variance of CPU utility rate in the traditional Hadoop cluster and the DHCI architecture are 0.196 and 0.1 respectively The ef\002ciency of the cluster load balance in the DHCI architecture is superior to that in the traditional Hadoop cluster From the perspective of load average the similar conclusion can be drawn 4.4 Test on data locality optimization To verify the effectiveness of the data locality optimization strategy we also use the benchmark Fig 11 Average CPU utility rate of each physical host in the two architectures Fig 12 Average load average of each physical host in the two architectures test cases namely WordCount TeraSort and Sort with 2 GB data volume The data in Fig 13 shows the difference in testing data from the DHCI architecture with and without data locality optimization respectively We can conclude that the time taken to execute these tasks with data locality optimization is less than that without data locality optimization while under the same data volume condition 5 Conclusion In this study we designed a novel dynamic Hadoop cluster IaaS architecture by introducing the following four modules monitoring scheduling VM management and VM migration modules In particular we proposed resource scheduling and data locality solutions We assessed the ef\002ciency of our solutions on the aforementioned virtual Hadoop cluster Convincing experimental results show that our solutions can effectively balance the load and improve system performance Acknowledgment This work was supported by the Open Project Program Fig 13 Comparison of running time in the DHCI architecture with and without data locality optimization

SECTION V EXPERIMENTS 
We allude to the lumps being Flush Reloaded by the advertisement versary as being observed since Flush-Reload basically screens access to information in the lump  Flushing a piece by means of clflush thus observing that piece should be possible without knowing the physical address of the lump since clflush takes the lump's virtual address for this situation in the adversary's address space as its operand  We call a quicker reload amid the Reload stage a watched occasion or perception  We additionally embrace ideas from measurable order and utilize the term false negative to allude to missed perceptions of the casualty's entrance to the checked piece and false positives to allude to watched occasions that are brought about by reasons other than the casualty's entrance to the observed piece We characterize a Flush-Reload convention in which the foe procedure screens a rundown of lumps at the same time and over and again until taught generally  It will first attempt to Reload the principal lump record the reload time and Flush it promptly thereafter At that point it will rehash these means on the second lump the third and so on until the last lump in the rundown  At that point the foe will sit tight for a precisely computed day and age before beginning once again from the primary piece so that the interim between the Flush and Reload of a similar lump is of an objective level 3 from the Reload of the main lump to the end of the holding up period is called one Flush-Reload cycle  An outline of the Flush-Reload convention is appeared in following Fig

It has been observed from experiments that container provides much more isolation among multiple users multi-tenants in cloud virtualization as compared to virtual machines Taking the example of Docker container which is light weight more secure and fast processing virtualization technique and getting much more familiarity due to its characteristics Also Container provides isolation at every instance of virtualization like at process level at file system level network level and at inter process communication lPe level
