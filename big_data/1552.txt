enterprises, becomes one kind of new management pattern. Now enterprises come to realize that effective supply chain management,which would have to assess supply chain performance.However,scientific,objective and comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the supply chain operating performance is an urgent problem need to be addressed. Based on analyzing the present fact of domestic and international vendor performance evaluation,Based on the construction of index system for supply chain supplier ability evaluation and analysis,a new method is presented in this paper which apply the principal component analysis and fisher method.It may overcome 
the existing methods shortcomings and contribute to the supplier selection.the analysis result might be taken as one of main reference for outsouring decision making.Finally, the modea is approved by a case provided which is practical and effective. The result shows that the model could reflect the gener capabilities of the supplier objectively and fairly and achieve an effective evaluation on supplier performance Keywords\227data mining;evaluation; performance;supply chain;supplier I   I NTRODUCTION  With product life cycles shortening,information technology and the rapid development of knowledge economy, and 
customer gradually increasing expectations,the competition among enterprises are gradually entering supply chain competition.In the market competition of global economy integration \223big and complete\224 enterprise is disintegrating gradually, the relation among enterprises present the obvious network tendency day by day, supply chain management SCM\obtain universal application in the Manufacturing enterprises, becomes one kind of new management pattern In the supply chain management, the thing that carrying on the reasonable appraisal and the choice to the supplier,would get supply chain cost reduction,response speed acceleration and efficiency enhancement,as well as enhancement of product and 
service quality,then satisfy  customer requirement[2   Supplier achievements evaluation and choice is one of important contents in supply chain design,which can respond the supply chain efficiency and benefit and the difference with competitor effectively.For our country SCM is being at the start stage, further research is not enough to its theory and method and the content of choosing and evaluating suppliers to be less. Now,the problem has been furrther studied by many literatures The domestic and foreign literature have conducted thorough research from many aspects to the supplier evaluation and the choice research question,theory and method, proposed 
different assessment method 4  T he s e l i t e r a t ure m a i nl y concentrate on the strategy level of supply chain design and the performance appraisal ,and which result only plays certain guiding role for the business management,without being one kind of policy-making tool truly. Although the quantitative research have already carried out deeply, but the choice of supplier most is depending on the experience, and lacking the scientifically rational appraisal system and menthod. Many research,which isn\222t based on supply chain foundation,couldnot adapt the supplier appraisal under the supply chain environment[5  s o t he st ud y of supp l i e r e va l ua t i o n o w n t he or y and practical significance II

Using the SAS software to analyze the original collected data.the principal component could eliminate the overlaps of the standard information and could information provided from standard, through mathematical calculation,objectively. in terms of statistics,these variables may exist high relativity,adding the complexity of the analyzing problem.So how about using a few irrelevant integrate variable to indicate the majority information is the important thing,In terms of mathematics,which is also called degradation logical thinking  13  The basic principle of multivariable analysis of the principal component,in order to search the information integrality, the table and fig as follows According to the eigenvalue and its percentages rate,which shows in table1, may select two of the principal component P1 and P2, that its percentages accumulative total can reach 81.99%, i.e. P1 and P2. The three genes reflect the information number can reach 81.99 According to the nine supply chain vender enterprise scoring in the principal component, judgment and comparison can be conducted on the operation condition in these enterprise.we can see, the highest score is got by enterprise S1 which stands for the enterprise S1 has the highest comprehensive ability. Followed by, enterprise S3 S6 S5 S7 and so on .the lowest comprehensive ability is S4 S8 and S9 Now since analysing the comprehensive sequencing situation of the income on the basis of the principal component,and then utilizing fisher to carry on cluster's analysis to the enterprises If we can not make sure the K, then we may make out L [P n,k   a s t h e fi gur e w h e n k c h a nge s  T h i s  p a pe r use G P L O T  process from SAS to make out L[P n,k   k   changes[14[[1 S e e fi g.1  K w a s d e t e r m i n e d  b y t h e c u r v e point.

Because the supplier is the logistics initial departure point in the entire supply chain which is the capital flow start point, simultaneously also the information flow end point, without  the supplier to supply goods  uninterrupted quality and quantity,punctuality and highly effection,the entire supply chain link enterprises wouldnot get smooth operation.Therefore, to the the evaluation for supplier is the entire supervisory control system's beginning. This paper makes the construction of the  index system for the evaluation and analysis of supply chain supplier and applies the principal component and fisher method to assess the supply chain vender. The method of principle component analysis could eliminate the overlaps of the standard information and could automatically provide weight through mathematical calculation, objectively. Adopting this method to assess supply chain supplier, it will be more simple dependent and could order the supplier with good and bad.moreover,this method could grade them.It’s proved to be reliable and effective in practical application, and The supply chain management and the design have the vital significance to enterprise's survival and the development,supply chain design to raise the enterprise reaction rate, enterprise flexibility enhancement, to reduce costs have the very vital significance The supply chain design can become the enterprise superintendent decision-making tool truly. But the supplier choice and the performance appraisal management is an precisely indispensable link. this research chooses the best supplier for the Manufacturing enterprises, which have certain inspiration function to decisions-making for enlarging with cooperation scope among close partners and  providing the theory basis for supply chain design.

resources managers throughout the agency to take proactive actions as soon as the plan variances surpassed certain critical thresholds. The OCFO defined a unified set of variance thresholds that applied to every Space Center and Space Mission. The thresholds were displayed in the dashboard as so-called  traffic lights  that is as red, yellow and green color indicators. This method allowed an easy tracking of  red  outliers and facilitated a management-byexception approach, as shown in Figure 5  Figure 5  ABED with  Traffic-Light  Indicators In addition to the dashboard, which was accessible without restrictions to any resources manager within the organization, the OCFO developed the monthly Agency Resource Management Performance Reports [4]. These publications were issue-oriented \(top 10 issues   red  performance areas highlighted performance benchmarks. Broadening the distribution and utilizing the performance reports beyond the OCFO community focused more management attention on budget execution performance than in prior years  Figure 6  Detailed Plan versus Actual Reports The OCFO also initiated a tightly woven communications network by establishing over 70 budget execution and procurement focal points at every Space Center and Mission Directorate office. This resulted in a highly effective bottom-up campaign directed at ensuring efficient and effective use of all resources during the financial year Technical Factors The tight development and implementation schedule required a highly flexible technology that could easily connect with existing systems. Conventional relational databases are at a disadvantage because they are schemabased, that is all data is stored in predefined table-spaces which are relatively hard to change. PMT, on the other hand, uses a  schema-less  xml4 database, that allowed the fully automatic indexing and retrieval of heterogeneous data sources as long as they were formatted as xml files [7 Within two months, a fully functional system prototype was created. PMT was used to 1 workforce data, from different center planning tools and from NASA  s accounting platform Business Warehouse \(SAP/BW 2 funded projects missions the agency  s work breakdown structure \(WBS 3  Financial Express Reports   which are large spreadsheet files with detailed plans versus actuals displays for any level in the WBS \(see Figure 6 4 other center systems The full system architecture is depicted in Figure 7 below  Figure 7  ABED System Architecture From a software engineering perspective the PMT team followed an approach known as  agile programming  8  4 xml stands for Extensible Markup Language 5 1 For this project, neither the time nor the organizational consensus was available to develop a comprehensive and complete requirements document \(some people argue that such documents are dysfunctional in any case refined and changed in close interaction with the customers \(OCFO the Mission Directorates and Space Centers. Data 


the Mission Directorates and Space Centers. Data input templates for the phasing plans, report formats and data exchange formats were iteratively refined as the customers had a chance to review and test working prototypes. Interactions between the development team and stakeholders occurred as needed, often on a daily basis. There was no formal decision mechanism  whatever could be solved on a  lower   level was just fine  with the one exception that any fundamental change in schedule or scope had to be approved by the agency CFO 2 provide an example, the PMT team collected 1,788 phasing plans from 10 different NASA Centers and Headquarters. The plans were received in four different data formats, and they were edited and refined over three rounds of submittals. Pretty much everything in this process was an up-to-last-minute change. As mentioned above, historically the NASA Centers used very different formats and concepts for their internal plans. As the OCFO strived for a unified standard, the different stakeholders pushed back multiple times requesting changes to this standard. The same thing happened with regard to the file exchange formats since the software teams at the individual Centers also had to respond to moving targets. In such a situation, frequent communication, software test runs, and flexible technology were crucial 3 Development and implementation of the various modules of the ABED were driven forward by the rapid release of fully functional prototypes. This rapidity allowed customers and other stakeholders to get a hands-on experience of the product early on More often than not, the requirements were refined after this first exposure. This refinement can be framed as a collective learning experience since both customers and developers developed insights that would have been impossible without a concrete product at hand. Ultimately, this hands-on approach led to a high confidence that the developed product would in fact be ready for operational use 4 In our experience, in situations of rapidly changing requirements, direct interactions among the individuals of the development team are more efficient and less error-prone than formal processes and tools \(such as bug-tracking tools consisted of three software developers, one management scientist, one accounting expert, and one customer service representative. This mix of expertise within a fairly small development team made it possible to react quickly to any stakeholder request whether it was technical or accounting-related in nature personal face-to-face communication 5. IMPROVEMENTS IN YEAR 2 The lessons-learned from fiscal year 2008 led to three main areas of potential improvements: increase in accuracy of plans, better communication, and capture of commitments as an early warning indicator As pointed out above the collection of unified phasing plans was highly successful in 2008. However, a detailed end-ofyear analysis revealed that the plan data for costs were overly optimistic. The cost plans predicted that 77% of funds would be costed by the end of the year when in fact only 71% were spent. Therefore, the OCFO decided to put special emphasis into encouraging the Centers and Mission Directorates to create performance-based plans rather than simply aligning the plans with average agency performance metrics To support this effort the OCFO created a series of 


To support this effort the OCFO created a series of measures 1 costing pattern for each funded project in 2008. This gave the resource analysts a baseline to work against 2  exception reports  These reports were used by the OCFO and the Mission Directorates to review the initial plan submissions. The exception reports highlighted any deltas between the 2008 spending pattern and the 2009 plans. In addition the reports also flagged any other errors and rule violations 3 to assist program offices and Centers in estimating the lead times for various types of procurements The second area of improvement was the communication between the functional organizations \(Centers product organizations \(Mission Directorates ownership of the final approved agency phasing plans. A highly interactive process with weekly teleconferences and three video-conferences, supported by enhanced phasing plan tools, was implemented to further open the missioncenter communication during the phasing plan development, review, and approval cycles 6 Finally, commitments \(see footnote 3  in addition to obligations and cost  were added to the set of performance indicators. Since the budget execution process starts with committing funds, the level of commitments could serve as an early warning indicator for obligations. In practice, the actual commitments of 2009 were compared to the historic spending pattern of 2008 6. DISCUSSION How many large-scale projects were canceled before their implementation even started? Project managers are only too familiar with the traditional model, which starts off with an extensive process of requirements collection. After years of producing large documents, the political situation has changed, the key executives have moved on and the project gets  re-scoped   If there was only one lesson learned for the development of management systems, then it is: define a clear goal and keep the requirements collection process as short as possible Start with the  low-hanging fruit  and use what is at hand and has proven its usefulness \(bricolage None of the other enablers was particularly new. However it was the consequent pursuit of a fast and results-oriented implementation that guided project management \(executive sponsor vs. expert facilitator stakeholder involvement, and a flexible software engineering approach \(agile programming Finally, a sustainable success can only be accomplished if the system actually gets used in  every-day  management decisions. In this case, the ABED became the single source of reference for a wide range of budget execution decisions within NASA REFERENCES 1] A.

The subsequent section discusses the evaluation of the designed methodology 


the evaluation of the designed methodology according to the design research paradigm  4. Evaluation of RPBBs  The evaluation described in this paper focuses on RPBBs which are the results of applying the methodology \(not the designed artifact itself Findings about quality and applicability of RPBBs allow conclusions regarding the quality and applicability of the underlying methodology. In this contribution, a formal and a contentual evaluation are differentiated. While the formal part contains theoretical analyses of RPBBs regarding predefined requirements \(cp. Section 3.1 documents the practical \(content-related applicability of RPBBs  4.1. Formal Evaluation  As part of the research project, twelve workshops and several interviews in European municipalities have been conducted which involved domain experts and modeling specialists who had to benchmark each RPBB with regards to fulfillment of the defined design goals \(cp. section 3.1 completely fulfilled, +/- partially fulfilled, - not fulfilled  not evaluated yet municipalities provided process models that were used to identify process activities and to design the RPBB. However they were not involved in the design process thus ensuring validity of the evaluation results through separation of data used to develop the method from evaluation data. As already mentioned in Section 3.1, the requirement of a minimal number Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 of RPBBs is replaced by relevancy/necessity. If all RPBBs are considered relevant and necessary, the number of RPBBs can be assumed minimal. Three RPBBs have not been evaluated, as they have just been identified during the prior evaluation period Table 6 provides an overview of the results  Table 6: Evaluation of RPBBs Requirements No. of evaluated RPBBs    Modularity 24 10 0 3 Reusability 33 1 0 3 Comprehensibility 31 3 0 3 Unambiguity 20 14 0 3 Documentation 33 1 0 3 Relevancy/Necessity 27 7 0 3 Multilingualism 34 0 0 3 Level of Generality 33 1 0 3 Level of Detail 22 12 0 3  Altogether, the degree of accomplishment can be considered as high. There is no RPBB that does not meet the demands. However, deficiencies can be identified regarding modularity, unambiguity and level of detail. Examples for deficits concerning the level of detail are the RPBBs ?send? and ?archive Especially archiving can be understood as a modular activity or separate process fragment. Weaknesses regarding modularity and unambiguity are closely related to the demand that only minimal overlapping should occur. Although overlapping could not be prevented completely, the evaluators? feedback initiated extensive revisions on names, synonyms examples and explanations of RPBBs. A list of the most deficient RPBBs is presented in Table 7. These 


most deficient RPBBs is presented in Table 7. These RPBBs have to be carefully analyzed during further modeling activities in order to be improved or rejected  Table 7: List of most deficient RPBBs RPBB No. of Deficiencies Coordinate 10 Assign 3 Take from 3 Change/Update/Complete 3  Summarizing, suitability of RPBBs for distributed modeling of collaborative processes can be confirmed on the basis of the formal evaluation However, evaluation from a content-based perspective provides more experience-driven and thus, practice-related feedback 4.2. Contentual Evaluation  For contentual, practice-oriented evaluation, a number of 200 processes have been modeled with five municipalities that are involved in the project to prove practical applicability. Using a prototypical web-based tool implementation, the modeling was carried out in a distributed manner by public administration officials. The procedure for distributed collaborative modeling required each official to depict the present status of their process fragments as well as the information flow with other process participants \(whom themselves modeled their activities points out the basic principle of differentiating RPBBs and information objects is presented in Figure 3 using the Business Process Modeling Notation [30 This fragment depicts the involvement of another collaborating unit within a municipal approval process which the building authority is basically responsible for. This unit participates in the service production by providing a statement. Although specific attributes have been annotated for RPBBs and information objects, they are not visible in the presented view. Examples are the number of pages and medium of information objects as well as communication channel, number of copies, and template support \(cp. Table 5 Documenting 200 real processes of diverse public administrations proved to be very valuable because both, the various issues as well as the perceived advantages of the component-based modeling approach emerged. Most important advantages mentioned by evaluators from public administrations are the standardization and flexibility of process modeling \(consistent levels of detail and generality as well as terminological pre-definitions specifications that enable modeling also for inexperienced people, and the transparent modeling approach \(combination of RPBBs and information objects methodology meets the basic requirements for distributed modeling of collaborative processes discussed in Section 2.1 Perceived issues to be addressed are a lack of awareness about some self-evident activities uncertainties regarding overlapping \(which should have been eliminated to a large extent level of detail which causes relatively high modeling efforts. Issues and advantages have to be considered by further research as the discussed findings only represent perception in the public sector domain  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009

Summary and Outlook  This paper describes the development of a methodology for the domain-independent identification of Reference Process Building Blocks which can be used for distributed modeling in collaborative process environments. Based on an initial evaluation of adaptation mechanisms from the area of reference modeling, suitability of a compositional \(building block-based derived. This contribution describes both the construction as well as the evaluation of the methodology in the public sector where the identified RPBBs have been used exemplarily for modeling of about 200 municipal processes Summarizing, the RPBB-based modeling is considered to be suitable to model collaborative processes in a distributed way. A number of advantages can be exploited from the described component based modeling approach such as the reduction of model heterogeneity and the diffusion of a common understanding \(through standardization of terminology, level of detail and level of abstraction the distributed modeling of process fragments by responsible domain experts as well as the consistent consolidation of the process fragments to complete process models based on their standardized components The actual methodology for RPBB identification provides a valuable basis for targeted users \(cp Section 1 individual domains and purposes. Although this contribution is limited to an analysis of the suitability for the public sector domain, the specified RPBBs can be evaluated for the use in other industries that focus on information management and collaborative service production \(e.g. finance or insurance sectors as well However, the claimed generality of the actual methodology for domain-independent identification of RPBBs has not been proven yet. For that purpose current research is concentrating on applying the methodology to other industries. Due to the collaborative character of medical treatment processes and the highly specialized and distributed knowledge of involved actors, the health care domain was selected for a follow-up project. The expected findings will provide valuable information to improve the methodology described in this paper Further challenges and potential fields for research arose during the evaluation. First, guidance rules should be developed in order to implement capable plausibility and consistency checks not only from a syntactic but especially from a semantic point of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 view [31]. Additional evaluation of the methodology itself \(which is the actual artifact by using the methodology in other domains, in order to refine and complete the design activities. A potential disadvantage identified during evaluation is related to the high level of detail which has to be managed. Although the provided methodology is 


managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
