Proceedings of the American Control Conference Arlington VA June 25-27 2001 Self-organizing Brain Dynamics by Which the Goals are Constructed that Control Patterns of Muscle Actions Walter J Freeman Department of Molecular and Cell Biology LSA 129 University of California at Berkeley CA 94720-3200 USA wfreeman@socrates.berkeley.edu http://sulcus.berkeley.edu Abstract Muscle control requires brain mechanisms that construct sequences of actions predict each 
next step and verifv through reaference and proprioception that the desired movements are taking place In a passive information processing system predefined stimuli convey information which is transduced by receptors into trains of impulses that signify the features of an object The symbols are processed according to rules for learning and association and are then bound into a representation, which is stored retrieved and matched with new incoming representations In active 
systems perception begins with the emergence of a goal that is implemented by the search for information The only input accepted is that which is consistent with the goal and is anticipated in conjunction with the acts of searching The key component to be modeled in brains is thedynamic subsytem that constructs goals and the adaptive actions by which the goals are achieved 1 Neurodynamics of goal-seeking 
producing acts of observation A device for measuring and recording such as a microphone TV monitor or satellite can provide and store information but it cannot make observations, nor can any extant computer to which the device is attached The computer can be given examples of patterns that are to be sought and it can be designed to detect the desired end states with specified levels of probability for positive and negative errors but it cannot formulate the goals for itself nor readily adapt the search 
strategy to its own changing needs and to rapid and unpredictable changes in its environment Those are the characteristics of biological intelligence in animals which are based in the capacities for self-organization in brain dynamics Furthermore, voice or motion activated surveillance recorders can be triggered by prescribed inputs to limit their scope of intake but once their gates are open transcription is passive and representational, not active or meaningful What is missing from these passive devices Freeman 19991 
is the goal-directedness contributed by observers The first step in understanding of the emergence of a goal in neurodynamics is to ask what occurs in a brain during an act of observation This is not a passive receipt of information from the world It is a purposive action by which an observer directs the sense organs toward a selected aspect of the world, suppresses all of the input except that which is relevant and interprets the resulting impact of the sensory barrage The concept of intentionality has been used to describe 
this process in different contexts, since its first use by Aquinas 1272 The three salient characteristics of intentionality as it is treated here are \(a\intent or directedness toward some future state or goal b wholeness and c\unity [Freeman 20011 These three aspects correspond to use of the term in psychology with the meaning of purpose, in medicine with the meaning of mode of healing and integration of the body and in analytic philosophy with the meaning of the way in which beliefs and thoughts are connected 
with about objects and events in the world Intent has 2 stages: first the endogenous initiation construction and direction of behavior into the world and second, the learning from the sensory consequences of the behavior It is hypothesis testing in which the outcome is predicted and the observer learns from the test by action into the world Humans and animals select their own goals plan their own tactics and choose when to begin modify and stop  0-7803-6495-3/011$10.00 0 2001 AACC 240 


sequences of action and humans at least are subjectively aware of themselves acting Unity appears in the combining of input from all sensory modalities into Gestalts fused multisensory images in the coordination of all parts of the body, both musculoskeletal and autonomic into adaptive, flexible, yet focused movements Subjectively unity appears in the awareness of self Wholeness is revealed by the orderly changes in the self and its behavior that constitute the development and maturation of the self within the constraints of its genes and its material social and cultural environments Subjectively, wholeness is revealed in the remembrance of the self through a lifetime of change 2 The limbic system is the organ of intentional behavior Brain scientists have known for over a century that the necessary and sufficient part of the vertebrate brain to sustain minimal intentional behavior is the ventral forebrain, including those components that comprise the external shell of the phylogenetically oldest part of the forebrain, the paleocortex, and the deeper lying nuclei with which the cortex is connected These components suffice to support remarkably adept patterns of intentional behavior in dogs after all the newer parts of the forebrain have been surgically removed and in rats with neocortex chemically inactivated by spreading depression Intentional behavior is severely altered or absent after major damage to the medial temporal lobe of the basal forebrain, as manifested most clearly in Alzheimer's disease This same part of the brain is essential for the formation of declarative episodic memories that are subject to conscious recall Clark and Squire 19981 as distinct from procedural memories such as those formed by classical conditioning procedures Phylogenetic evidence comes from observing intentional behavior in salamanders which have the simplest of the existing vertebrate forebrains Herrick 1948; Freeman 19951 The three parts are sensory which as in small mammals is predominantly olfactory motor and associational The latter part contains the primordial hippocampus which is identified in higher vertebrates as the locus of the functions of spatial orientation by the cognitive map OKeefe  Nadel 19781 and temporal integration of learning the organization of long and short term memory [Figure 13 UYNAfllC AKHI~TUE R TtE LIMBIC SY5TEM RBcEplme WKW\200HT FEHZMCC m Low a PROPRIDCEPTIVE LCUP IMFFERENE wrm U  ML cI3LTEU a 6TFIB16 Figure 1 The limbic system spacetime loop"\gets all sensory input and distributes it to all sensory and motor systems For example hunger is an emergent pattern of neuroactivity that expresses the requirements of brains and bodies for metabolic fuel and building material It induces a state transition in the neural populations of the forebrain under the influence of sensory stimuli from the gut and the brain's own chemoreceptors for its chemical state It is also shaped by neurohormones from nuclei in the brain stem The emergent pattern impacts the brain stem and spinal cord leading to stereotypic searching movements that are adapted to the immediately surrounding world Feedback from the muscles and joints to the somatosensory cortex provides confirmation that the intended actions are taking place The impact of the movements of the body on sensory input is conveyed to the visual, auditory and olfactory systems All of the perceptual constructs which are triggered by sensory stimuli and dependent on prior learning are transmitted to the limbic system specifically to the entorhinal cortex where they are combined When an animal detects an odor 241 


of food, it must hold it move take another sniff and compare the two concentrations in order to decide which way to move next The difference in strength has no meaning unless the animal has records of which way it moved when the samples were taken and a basis for determining distance and direction in its environment These basic operations of intentional behavior are properties of the limbic system The same requirements hold for all distance receptors so it is clear why evolution has provided for prior multimodal sensory convergence in order to perform space-time integration on the Gestalt not on its components 3 Properties of EEG activity patterns These briin states are observed in spatial patterns of EEG electroencephalographic potentials that are not representations of stimuli nor are they the simple effects caused by stimuli Each learned stimulus serves to elicit the construction of a pattern that is shaped by the synaptic modifications among cortical neurons from prior learning and also by the brain stem nuclei that bathe the forebrain in neuromodulatory chemicals Freeman 1992 20001 It is a dynamic action pattern that creates and carries the meanings of stimuli for the animal It reflects the individual history present context and expectancy corresponding to the unity and the wholeness of the intentionality The patterns created in each cortex are unique to each animal All sensory cortices transmit their signals into the limbic system where they are integrated with each other over time, and the resultant integrated meaning is transmitted back to the cortices in the processes of selective attending, expectancy, and the prediction of future inputs by reafference The same kinds of EEG activity as those found in the sensory and motor cortices are found in various parts of the limbic system This discovery indicates that the limbic system also has the capacity to create its own spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity They are related to past experience and convergent multisensory input, but they are self-organized The limbic system serves to generate the neural activity that forms goals and directs behavior toward them EEG evidence shows that the process occurs in rapid steps like frames in a b/w motion picture Each frame is formed by a 1st order state transition from a basal receiving state I SONY Dup Anathasio   Figure 2 EEGs in deep anesthesia open loop bottom 4th trace resting 3rd trace and aroused top Bursts of oscillation result from destabilization of the system with each inhalation upward in 2nd trace Each step follows a dynamic state transition in which an assembly of neuron populations jumps suddenly from one spatiotemporal pattern to the next as the behavior evolves Being intrinsically unstable the limbic system continually transits across states and broadcasts them to other parts of the brain and then relapses to a basal state so as to give rise to new ones Limbic output controls the brain stem nuclei that serve to regulate its excitability levels implying that it regulates its own neurohumoral context enabling it to respond with equal facility to changes that call for arousal and adaptation or rest and recreation both in the body and the environment The neurodynamics of the limbic system, assisted by other parts of the forebrain such as the frontal lobes, initiates the novel and creative actions seen in search by trial and error 4 Characerization of brain states In neurodynamics [Freeman 20001 analysis begins with defining three kinds of stable state, each with its type of attractor The point attractor holds the neurons at rest unless perturbed by input and they return to rest 242 


when allowed to do so Examples of point attractors are silent neurons or populations that have been isolated from the brain or depressed by a strong anesthetic to the point where the EEG has gone flat Figure 2 This is the open loop state in which the time and space constants of populations are measured from the linear dendritic response to impulse input 6\(t with rates of rise a and decay b from fitting the curve with the solution to a 2nd order ODE where kij is coupling for input to dendritic synapses, v is wave p is pulse density d2v/dt2  a+b  ab v  kijG\(p 1 and G\(p\is an asymmetric sigmoid function governing wave-pulse conversion This static nonlinearity is derived from the Hodkin Huxley equations, for the asymmetric wave-to pulse conversion applied to populations p=p0 I l-exp[-\(eV-l v  UO 2 dp/dv  U exp v-\(ev-l 3 Instability is made input-dependent by the asymmetry It creates an attractor landscape composed of the basins determined by learning classes of input  TlON  ATTRACTORB WAKINQ REST SLEEP I DEEP ANESTHESIA Figure 3 A portrait is shown of the state space of the olfactory system In a motivated state the system oscillates between chaotic and limit cycle attractors recreating and dissolving the landscape rapidly to allow repeated sampling of odors A special case of a point attractor is noise This state is observed in populations of neurons in the brain of a subject at rest with no evidence of overt behavior \(Figure 2 3rd trace The neurons fire continually but not in concert with each other. Their pulses occur in long trains at irregular times Knowledge about the prior pulse trains from each neuron and those of its neighbors up to the present fails to support the prediction of when the next pulse will occur The state of noise has continual activity with no history of how it started, and it gives only the expectation that its amplitude and other statistical properties will persist unchanged A system that gives periodic behavior is said to have a limit cycle attractor The classic example is the clock When it is viewed in terms of its ceaseless motion it is regarded as unstable until it winds down runs out of power and goes to a point attractor If it resumes its regular beat after it is re-set or otherwise perturbed it is stable as long as its power lasts Its history is limited to one cycle, after which there is no retention of its transient approach in its basin to its attractor Neurons and populations rarely fire periodically, and when they appear to do so close inspection shows that the activities are in fact irregular and unpredictable in detail and when periodic activity does occur it is either intentional, as in rhythmic drumming or pathological as in nystagmus and Parkinsonian tremor The third type of attractor gives aperiodic oscillation of the kind that is observed in recordings of EEGs There is no one or small number of frequencies at which the system oscillates The system behavior is therefore unpredictable because performance can only be projected far into the future for periodic behavior This type was first called strange it is now widely known as chaotic The existence of this type of oscillation was known to PoincarC a century ago, but systematic study was possible only recently after the full development of digital computers The best known simple systems with chaotic attractors have a small number of components and a few degrees of freedom as for example, the double-hinged pendulum and the dripping faucet Large and complex systems such as neurons and neural populations are thought to be capable of chaotic behavior, but proof is not yet possible at the present level of developments in mathematics 243 


The discovery of chaos has profound implications for the study of brain function Haken 1983 Skarda and Freeman 1987 A chaotic system has the capacity to create novel and unexpected patterns of activity It can jump instantly from one mode of behavior to another which manifests the facts that it has a landscape of attractors each with its basin and that it can move from one basin to another in an itinerant trajectory Tsuda 1996 It retains in its pathway across its basins its history which fades into its past just as its predictability into its future decreases with distance Transitions between chaotic states constitute the dynamics we need to understand how brains do what they do 5 The cortical state transition is the elemental step of intentionality Systems such as neurons and brains that have multiple chaotic attractors also have point and limit attractors A system that is in the basin of one of its chaotic attractors is legendary for the sensitivity to what are called the initial conditions This refers to the way in which a simple system is placed into the basin of one of its attractors If the basin is that of a point or a limit cycle attractor, the system proceeds predictably to the same end state If the basin leads to a chaotic attractor the system goes into ceaseless fluctuation as long as its energy lasts If the starting point is identical on repeated trials which can only be assured by simulation of the dynamics on a digital computer the same aperiodic behavior appears This is why chaos is sometimes called deterministic If the starting point is changed by an arbitrarily small amount, although the system is still in the same basin the trajectory is not identical If the difference in starting conditions is too small to be originally detected it can be inferred from the unfolding behavior of the system as the difference in trajectories becomes apparent This observation shows that a chaotic system can create information in the course of continually constructing its own trajectory into the future In each sensory cortex there are multiple basins corresponding to previously learned classes of stimuli and also the unstimulated state Exhalation hi o tho t ion  Y Deep Anesthesia Figure 4 A perspective projection of the state space from Figure 3 shows the learned attractor landscape that forms with each inhalation giving the basis for rapid selection by a stimulus and that then dissolves clearing the entire landscape to allow receiving and classifying the next sample from the environment Together they form an attractor landscape that repeatedly forms and dissolves at each new stimulus frame The chaotic prestimulus state in exhalation Fig 4 establishes the sensitivity of the cortex so that the very small number of sensory action potentials evoked by an expected stimulus can carry the cortical trajectory into the basin of an appropriate attractor The part of the world in which the stimulus is to be sought is selected by the limbic brain through orientation of the sensory receptors by sniffing looking and listening The basins of attraction are shaped by limbic input to sensitize the reception of input belonging to a desired class of stimuli The web of synaptic connections that was modified by learning forms the landscape of basins and attractors that serve to guide acts of observation Access to attractor basins is by destabilization of the cortical neural populations, manifested in a 1st order state transition The attractor by which the system is then governed determines the spatial pattern of the oscillatory output by imposing amplitude modulation on the shared wave form which is transmitted by axons in parallel using pulse frequency modulation and time multiplexing to an array of targets where the signal is extracted after smoothing by a spatial integral 244 


transform imposed by a divergent-convergent axon projection The selection of the basin of attraction is done by the stimulus given to the receptors feeding the primary receiving cortex The basins and their attractors are shaped by Hebbian and non-Hebbian learning as well as by reafferent barrages [Kay et al 1996 Kay and Freeman 19981 that bias and tilt the attractor landscape The trajectory manifested in the EEG is higher in dimension than the landscape so that every basin is immediately accessible from every point of the trajectory with minimal need for search Capture by one of the attractors reduces the dimension of activity below that of the landscape 6 Conclusions We are clearly still a long way from full understanding of intentionality in animals and even farther from constructing analog systems that will embody the principles of active perception by which brains achieve their ascendency The main inference that I wish to propose from these biological studies is that there is nothing mysterious or inaccessible about intentional behavior and that given the right insights into how simpler brains organize themselves in the necessary construction and pursuit of their own goals, there is no insuperable barrier to building devices that have those capacities There is already substantial progress in that direction through the development of embodied robots Clark 1996 Hendriks-Jansen 1996 Brooks 19991 It is not too soon to begin to consider the ethical issues that success in these projects will surely raise Acknowledgments This work was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and from the Office of Naval Research References Aquinas St. Thomas \(1272\The Summa Theologica Volume 19 in the Great Books Series Chicago:Encyclopedia Britannica Inc 1952 Barrie JM Freeman WJ Lenhart M 1996 Modulation by discriminative training of spatial patterns of gamma EEG amplitude and phase in neocortex of rabbits Journal of Neurophysiology Brooks R.A 1999 Cambrian Intelligence: The Early History of the New AI Cambridge MA MIT Press Clark A 1996\Being There.

dictive model for representing user behaviors and a useful mechanism for identifying and interpreting user behavior patterns for the Web data 7 Conclusions and Future Work We described a mixture model based approach to generating and visualizing individual behavior models for CiteSeer users We represented the Web data as a collection of ordered action sequences for each user We introduced a maximum entropy based approach for modeling the user behavior motivated by its ability to model long term dependencies in data sequences In addition to maxent model we also investigated the use of 336rst order Markov mixture models We demonstrated that both methods are able to generate strong predictive models with different strengths and weaknesses Markov model performed better for predicting the behavior of the known users whereas maximum entropy model was better at modeling the global behavior model and therefore the unknown users also We used a simple method to achieve personalization yet managed to avoid the insuf\336cient data problem of traditional personalization techniques By using mixture model based clustering we were able to identify and visualize speci\336c behavior patterns of CiteSeer users where it s demonstrated that maximum entropy model\325s computational cost pays off t recognizing complex dominant patterns of user behavior We plan to expand our work on identifying speci\336c user behavior patterns and provide customized services for instance customized recommendations for each of the behavior model groups We are also interested in naming these groups of users We intend to perform real-time experiments on CiteSeer with our maximum entropy based predictive model We are also planning to apply our personalization algorithm to mixtures of hidden Markov models and compare it with the maxent model proposed in this paper 8 Acknowledgements This work has been partially supported by a grant from Lockheed Martin We would like to thank Steve Lawrence for making

wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
