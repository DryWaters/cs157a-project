From the data mining language, users can specify the interested items or the sequences, and the minimum support and the minimum confidence threshold to discover interesting multidimensional association rules. And then according to Rough set theory, we transform multi-dimensional association rules to elementary sets description, antecedents corresponding with feature classes, consequent corresponding with concept in RS, and then propose the efficient data mining algorithm MIMAR-RS to process the user requirements, combined with the idea of generating frequent itemsets dynamically thus reducing the search space to produce frequent itemsets reducing the time complexity. Furthermore, it can avoid redundant rules R EFERENCES  1  Wu shen, Gao xue-dong, M.Bastien Data warehouse and data mining Metallurgical Industry Press, Beijing, 2003 2  Agrawal R, Imielinski T, and Swami A Mining Associations Between Sets of Items in Massive Databases In: Proc. of the 1993 3  Agrawal R,Srikant R.
