    Figure 6: Transitivity bias of FIT-NEW network over the time   Figure 7: Similarity bias of FIT-NEW network over the time   Figure 8: Closure bias of FIT-NEW network over the time  VIII  C ONCLUSION  Based upon communication and social theories, this work proposed and tested hypotheses for four micro structural forces that create friendship structure in online social networking websites. Two network datasets from an educational online social network were used for the empirical investigation. Nine stochastic models, each incorporating different combination of micro structural forces, were built and compared, using recently reformulated bias net theory. Hypotheses for all of the processes were confirmed. Best fitting model was found to be the one which incorporated all of the proposed forces. Reciprocity is the strongest force acting in the network, followed by transitivity, similarity and finally closure. Longitudinal analysis showed the evolution of individual forces and the network density. Irregularity of the closure bias needs to be further investigated IX  R EFERENCES  1  Y. Y. Ahn, S. Han, H.

 9   These parameters were calculated using the relations  Analysis of Model A and B  Since both models A and B had same wave deflection angle the analysis gave similar results  For M 1 1.73, ratio of specific heats 1.4 and 12 degrees the ratio of pressure after and before the shock was calculated to be 1.920  The Mach number after the shock was found to be 1.25, it shows that it is still in supersonic regime and therefore the oblique shock formed is a weak oblique shock  Wave angle is also given by the sum of the Mach angle  and small angular difference Therefore      Here is given by the relation   1 1 2 4 \(M 1 2 226 1    That is, for a finite deflection angle the direction of weak oblique shock wave differs from the Mach wave direction  by an amount which is of the same order as   The Mach wave direction was calculated as 35 degrees and was calculated to be around 12 degrees. Sum of these two parameters gave the wave angle to be 40 degrees This is in good accordance with the experimental analysis of Models A and B, which is about 50 degrees  Pressure and temperature before and after the shocks were calculated from the isentropic relationships as the flow was assumed to be isentropic. The following values were determined  P1 = 0.197 bar = 19.7kPa P2 = 0.38 bar = 38kPa  T1 = 187.8 K T2 = 228.6 K  Analysis of Model C  Detached shock was observed near the nose of Model C This shock resulted as the wall deflection angle was greater than max Model C had was designed to have a blunt nose. In such a case, the shock wave remains detached at all supersonic Mach numbers. The flow immediately behind the shock was subsonic. It was difficult to determine the sonic line  The analysis of the flow fiel d associated with detached shock becomes very difficult because of transonic flow which prevails behind the shock. In such a case, the shape of the shock was observed and the detachment distance was determined. It becomes co mplicated to measure the properties in such rarefied flows. Hence the following parameters were found  The detachment distance was found to be 0.3cm from the nose of the model and the shape of the detached shock resembled conventional detached shock wave. However oblique shocks were noticed towards the downstream flow over the model as marked in the picture. The strength of the detached shock waves weakens with the formation of the oblique shock and further weakens until it becomes a Mach line, far away from the object. Unfortunately due to the unavailability of rectangular windows the entire section of the model could not be studied  6. F LUENT S OFTWARE A NALYSIS   Fluent is a general purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. Fluent technology offers a wide array of physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries. Th is software was chosen to compute, analyze and model the flow conditions in and around moving models  The wind tunnel models were modeled in Gambit software package and two dimensional analyses was done. Two dimensional analyses were to simplify the complexities arising from turbulent flow model analysis. The top and side views of the models were meshed using Gambit and were exported to Fluent to model the flow conditions  The 2ddp version in Fluent was used. The flow was modeled using density based solver, k-epsilon viscous model was used and properties of air were assumed to be constant. The analysis was done for normal supersonic cruising conditions at 50000 ft at a pressure of 12000 Pa and temperature 216 K. The Mach number was set to about 1.8 for analyzing Model A and B and sonic Mach number for Model C  Analysis of Model B  The top and sectional side views of the model were plotted and meshed using Gambit mesh solver. The mesh was imported in Fluent and the operating conditions were set as stated in the previous paragraphs. The analysis gave contours of pressure, temperat ure, velocity, Mach number and turbulence      
 


 10    The above contour shows static pressure distribution across the model. It can be seen that th ere is a pressure rise near the nose when the flow first encounters the body  There is a gradual rise in pressure as shown by yellow region. This is due to the reas on that pressure increases after the bow shock about compression corners     The contour above gives the static temperature. A gradual rise in temperature is observed downstream of shock wave This is due to the supersonic flow around the compression around the corners. The static temperature distribution may help in selecting the materials required in certain areas to withstand the conditions at cruising  Mach number variation over the aircraft profile is plotted in the following page. A drop in the Mach number is noticed after the shock formation. This is due to the formation of oblique  shock wave at the nose. The following contour gives the turbulence intensity over the profile 
 


 11   Maximum turbulence is encountered at the wing tips. This could be attributed to the fact that vortex is generated near the trailing edges. This could be minimized by providing alterations to the design of the wing tips. The remaining region around the boundaries seems to be fairly stable and validates this to be a good design The sectional view of Model B was also analyzed. The resulting contours are presented here in the following page

 13 Analysis of Model A The analysis of Model A gave varying results owing to the variation in the profiles of the plan view and the sectional side view. The sectional side view is diamond type unlike that of Model B which is convex in shape. Both are however, ideal supersonic airfoils The sectional side view of Model A shows a rise in pressure behind the shock wave. This is because of the oblique shock wave formation around the compression corners. A drop in pressure is noticed at the expansion corner due to the formation of expansion fan at the convex corners The top view of Model A, when analyzed in Fluent gave the following contours. Formation of a high pressure region ahead of the wing profile sh ows the formation of a bow wave. This may induce very high wave drag and may not be a good optimized model    
 


 14 Analyses of Model C Analyses of Model C were done at Mach 1 to avoid divergence in the solution. The following results were obtained. The analyzed cont our clearly shows a high pressure region ahead of the nose This is the detached shock wave that is formed as seen in the shadowgraph. A region of high pressure exists after the detached shock      
 


 15      7  C ONCLUSION  The results from experimental theoretical and software analysis validate the fabricated models to work well over the supersonic regimes. Models A and B have reduced shock strength. This advantage could be explored in the design of a transcontinental supersonic passenger airliner. The models prove to be aerodynamically efficient and have lesser wave drag However, there were a few shortcomings in this approach The fabrication of such an ai rliner at a bigger scale could 
 


 16 prove to be a challenging task. Installation of engines would have to be looked into from a different aspect This work could be extended to study various other complicated supersonic aircraft profiles; the distribution of pressure, shock pattern and shock strength can be studied Unless efforts are continued on this regard, the viability of an efficient supersonic airc raft is likely to languish  R EFERENCES  1  United States Patent - 4828204 , Supersonic  Airplane by Gottfried O.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
