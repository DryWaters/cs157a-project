INTRODUCTION  Subway systems or metro systems have been considered to be the most convenient mode of commuter transportation in metropolitan area and as an important model of transport in order to relieve congestion, as well as to the quality of public transport 1, 2, 3]. Due to these advantages, many people within the worldwide metropolitan areas commute using underground subway transportation and spend considerable time in the underground subway environment on a daily basis [4]. Therefore, it has been increased attention to air quality in the subway space or environment because of its possible distinct influence on public health Korea Ministry of Environment \(Korea MOE established Indoor Air Quality \(IAQ MOE to control five major pollutants such as PM10 carbon dioxide \(CO2 CO organic compounds \(VOC environment including platform of subway [3, 5, 6 And these five major pollutants have been measured passively or monitored automatically However, underground subway stations have some unique characteristics in that they are somewhat closed spaces with strong indoor pollutants emission sources containing particle matter [5]. Due to the movement of trains and passengers, many pollutants can be generated mainly and can be accumulated in this closed environment, resulting in high concentrations of indoor air pollutants. Also, serious indoor air pollution is caused by inadequate ventilation system [6 The air quality of underground environment is affected by many conditions or variables, where exists the relationship among these variables. But the previous study as well as government management in Korea has tend to ignore the correlation of these variables and has been focused on monitoring by measuring only single pollutants For more appropriate management or solution against the indoor air pollution, the correlation of variables should be considered. Recently, there are a few studies about variable correlation [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 In this study, the multivariate analysis is applied to the real data of air pollutants in a subway station. In order to extract key information from the dataset, principal component analysis \(PCA common multivariate methods is used in this study [7 Especially, it was used to find the installation effect of the PSD system on the change of indoor air quality Although the PSD system is set up to prevent the suicide or any other safety accident, they can also affect the indoor air quality in a subway station due to their blocking effect of particle matter Multidimensional Interpretation of the Air Quality Change by the Installation of PSD in a Subway Station  Yong-Su Kim1, Min-Han Kim1, Seo-Jin Kim2, In-Won Kim2, Jae-Sik Jeon3 and Chang-Kyoo Yoo1  1Dept. of Environmental Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Suwon, Korea Tel: +82-31-201-3824; E-mail: bamsu83@hanmail.net, werver0311@khu.ac.kr., *ckyoo@khu.ac.kr 2Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea Tel: +82-2-450-3508; E-mail:inwon@konkuk.ac.kr 3Seoul Metropolitan Research Institute of Public Health and Environment Tel: +82-2-570-3135; E-mail: jeon1807@hanmail.net  Abstract: The purpose of this research is to measure the change of the air pollutants in a  


Abstract: The purpose of this research is to measure the change of the air pollutants in a  subway station by the installation of a platform screen door \(PSD  change of the indoor air quality in a subway station. Principal component analysis \(PCA  installation effect and interpret their multivariate relationships between the indoor pollutants. Data set which was  measured at the Y-station during 7 months is used for this study, which consists of 9 variables. The indoor air quality in  a platform shows a big difference between existence and nonexistence of PSD. PSD system has a strong effect on the  concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 in a subway station by its blocking effect from re-suspension of the particulate. The  PCA analysis confirms that there is a correlation of PM10 and PM 2.5 between indoor and outdoor air and also between  before and after the PSD installation. This difference represents that the correlation of the contaminant variables has  been changed by the PSD system and the correlation of PM10 and PM2.5 also varied under the PSD. This study shows that a  multidimensional analysis can find the cause and result of the indoor air quality variation by the PDS system and  effectively interpret the change of the pollutants in a subway station  Keywords: Air quality analysis; Health effect; Multivariate data analysis; Principal component  PCA screen door \(PSD  ICROS-SICE International Joint Conference 2009 August 18-21, 2009, Fukuoka International Congress Center, Japan PR0002/09/0000-1693  400  2009 SICE 1694  2. THEORY  2.1. Multivariate analysis, PCA Principal component analysis \(PCA technique that transforms a set of inter-related variables into a set of uncorrelated variables [12]. The newly formed variables are so called principal components PCs the original variables Figure 1 illustrates a typical structure of model by two PCs. The PC  s are obtained in such a way that the initial principal components capture the most significant sources of variation and it decreases for each subsequent component         Fig. 1.The typical structure of model by two PCs  The number of PC  s retained can then be chosen to be the component beyond which the plot is close to linear To better illustrate the relationship between the PC  s and the original variables, the retained PC  s can be transformed by applying a rotation algorithm such as Varimax rotation [12]. The variables which have high correlation each other are similar on PC loadings. This technique could be applied for identification of relationship of air pollutant in subway station in this study By using PCA, a data set is modeled as X X ' T P ' E    1            \(1 In the expression above, the first term, X  1 


In the expression above, the first term, X  1 represents the variable averages and originates from the pre-processing step. The second term, the matrix product, 'T P  models the structure and the third term the residual matrix E , contains the noise The principal component scores of the first, second third  components \( , ,1 2 3t t t   score matrix T . These scores are the co-ordinates of the observations in the model \(hyper-plane Alternatively, these scores may be seen as new variables which summarize the old ones. In their derivation, the scores are sorted in descending importance \( 1t explains more variation than 2t , 2t  explains more variation than 3t , and so on principal components are sufficient to approximate a data table well [13 The meaning of the scores is given by the loadings The loadings of the first, second, third  components 1 2 3P P P   a prime has been used with P  to denote its transpose The loadings define the orientation of the PC plane with respect to the original X-variables. Algebraically the loadings inform how the variables are linearly combined to form the scores. The loadings unravel the magnitude \(large or small correlation positive or negative correlation variables contribute to the scores [14  3. MATERIAL AND METHODS  3.1 Dataset PCA was applied to dataset collected at Y stations in line number 3, from October 2007 to April 2008. The samples were taken each day creating a data base with 71 samples \(observation, rows concentration of outside PM10, ratio of PM10 between platform and outside, temperature, humidity, wind speed, the concentration of PM10, PM2.5 on platform, the ratio of PM2.5 and PM10 on platform, the number of passengers. The concentration of particle matter on platform is measured during 20 hours on every 5L/min by Mini Volume Air Sampler \(Airmetrics, USA the concentration of outside PM10 and the weather condition are collected through TMS of Seoul Metropolitan Research Institute of Public Health and Environment and Internet material of the meteorological office. And the number of passenger is used from an information system of Seoul metro  3.2. Methods First, univariate charts are used to monitor a small number of key pollutant variables in order to observe the trend among the variables and see the change of indoor air quality by PSD installation. By finding assignable change of variables, long term monitoring and management can be achieved by considering the trend and the assignable change of variables. However monitoring only a single or a few variables is totally inadequate because all variables are not independent of one another but have a correlation and interrelationship 13  Fig. 2. Multidimensional monitoring considering the effect of PSD system  First, univariate reduced to monitor the nine variables in order to survey the trend and the change of pollutants by installation of PSD. And then, PCA is applied to the dataset which is made by the installation of PSD on a 1695 model and error space to monitor the air pollutants 


model and error space to monitor the air pollutants simultaneously for considering the correlation among the variables. Finally, local models with and without PSD system are used to find their effect in Fig. 2  4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  For inquiring the change of pollutants, the dataset was classified into two groups based on installation of PSD. In the whole period, the indoor air quality considered in an almost normal state. The first 29 observations were used for the development of the PCA model in the period when is not set up the PSD. The remaining 42 observations were used in the period when is set up the PSD  4 .1.Univariate monitoring of air quality One way to monitor the trend or the change of variables is to use a univariate quality index. Fig. 3 shows time series plot of nine pollutants in a subway station   Fig. 3.Univariate quality index of nine air pollutants in a subway station  X-axis represents the number of observations and y-axis represents the concentration of each pollutants. It shows that the change of temperature is related to the seasonal change. Since the dataset is composed from October to April, this phenomenon is reasonable to explain it related to seasonal change. In Fig. 3, the concentration of PM10 at outside is usually higher from 30th observations. PM10 and PM2.5 are represented similar trend and is also lower from 30th observations like PM10 at a tunnel As considering that the 30th observation is the number which is measured from setting up the PSD, it seems that the PSD system affect the air quality of platform By setting up the PSD system, the PMs at a tunnel could not enter into a platform \(particulate blocking Specifically, the PSD has an effect which is blocked from re-suspension of the particulate. While, the concentration of PMs at a tunnel is increased, the platform  s concentration is decreased. Statistically, the mean of PM10 at tunnel is higher from 62.1?g/m3 to 78.7?g/m3 and the means of platform PM10 is lower from 115.8 to 97.2, the means of platform PM2.5 is also lower from 66.2?g/m3 to 58.1?g/m3  4.2. A multivariate monitoring  PCA In the previous section, univariate quality index is a plot of each single variable. But, in reality, these variables are not independent. They should be treated simultaneously for adequate monitoring of indoor air quality [16 With PCA, the information content in all nine variables is considered jointly. When it is fitted up the global model by using a whole data as a training data, it results in a model with three components explaining 69% of the total sum of squares The score plot in Fig. 4 explains two-thirds of the total variation. The Hotelling test statistic for multivariate normality, T2, is displayed as 95 percent tolerance region. In Fig. 4, there are two parts which is divided by installation of PSD system. The data with PSD is usually existed on the left-bottom side, and the data without PSD is existed on the right-top side. That is PSD system affects indoor air quality in a subway station To understand and interpret the distribution of the 


To understand and interpret the distribution of the samples in Fig. 4, it is instructive to examine the corresponding loading plot shown in Fig. 5. The loading plot gives an overall picture of the variable correlation structure [16   Fig. 4.The score plot in a global model   Fig. 5.The loading plot in a global model  The nine variables are grouped three clusters in Fig. 5 1696  The first cluster is related to temperature and humidity the second cluster is related to PM10 and PM2.5 on platform and last cluster is related to the ratio of PM2.5 and PM10, the concentration of PM10 at a tunnel The first group contains humidity and temperature that are more related each other than other pollutants Generally, saturated vapor is increased as the temperature is going up. Therefore, when the temperature is increased, the humidity is decreased, but in case of the subway, if the temperature is increased the humidity is increased because the increased quantity of current vapor by evaporation of sweat is bigger than the increased quantity of the saturated vapor. Therefore people in a subway may feel the corresponding displeasure in the summer period. The second group is made up of PM2.5 and PM10 of platform which are proportional to the quantity of dusts which is the ventilation result of outdoor air and the moving of passengers. Following the previous study, these variables are mostly affected by the moving of passengers [12, 17]. But, the concentration of PM on platform is more affected by the outside air quality than the number of passengers. This result could be confirmed by the degree of correlation as shown in Table 1  Table 1. The variables correlation in a global model O PM10 P/O PM10 Tem Hum Ws P- PM10 P PM2.5 PM2.5 PM10 Pass enger O PM10 1.00 -0.57 0.28 0.21 -0.26 0.59 0.68 0.34 -0.00 002 P/O PM10  1.00 0.12 0.11 -0.02 0.22 0.07 -0.37 -0.03 Tem  1.00 0.38 -0.21 0.44 0.43 0.08 0.02 Hum  1.00 -0.10 0.46 0.48 0.18 0.08 Ws  1.00 -0.41 -0.43 -0.18 -0.09 P

Therefore, it means that the outside air quality is more affected to PM concentration of platform than passengers. As shown in a previous score plot \(Fig 3 installation of PSD system. So, it is necessary to consider that each local model may be different from global model made by using a whole data  4.3. Local model by installation of PSD Each process followed the previous one. These models are made through a training data which is divided by installation of PSD. The model without PSD can explain 79.1% of the total variation of training data and the model with PSD can explain about 67.7% of variations in a training data. This means that it is a good summary of the each data as it represents more than two-thirds of the total variation For the interpretation of the air quality change by the installation of PSD in a subway system, it is represented the loading plot in Fig. 6. It can be explained the variable correlation structure a b Fig. 6. The loading plot of each seasonal model a b  In a case of without PSD, the nine variables are strongly grouped into three clusters, one is related to temperature and humidity and another is related to particle matter containing ratio. The other is the ratio of PM10 between tunnel and platform, wind-speed. The variable, Passengers, has a little effect to other variables Compared to the without PSD result, the distribution of variables is more broad. Only PM10 and PM2.5 have relationship each other. Hence, when it is showed the different results between without PSD and with PSD, it could be analogized that the PSD affect the change of air quality on platform. These results are explained more strongly by the degree of correlation as shown in Table 2, 3 In a without PSD case, the value between PM10 at a tunnel and PM10, PM2.5 on platform are 0.78, 0.82. But after setting up the PSD, the effect of PM10 at a tunnel is decreased and this results is reflected that the degree of correlation between PM of tunnel and platform  s PM is 1697 decreased. And the relationship is high between PM10 and PM2.5 on platform in a case of without PSD and with PSD  Table 2.The variables correlation of without PSD O

The point which is focused on is that particular indoor space such as subway-station platform and so on is a limited closed space. The problem that the particular space has is that the pollutants is taken place at once, it is very hard to remove it without any managements. Since the pollutants are accumulated in platform, the stay-time longer and longer, the risk of diseases is increased Therefore, it is needed adequate management against the pollutants For interpretation of the air quality change by the installation of PSD, it is applied for PCA to each dataset which is divided by installation Of PSD. The model without PSD can explain 79.1% of the total variation of training data and the model with PSD can explain about 67.7% of variations in training data. And it is showed the different results between w/o PSD and with PSD on loading plot. Also, when it is compared the degree of correlation of variables, the value between PM10 at a tunnel and PM10, PM2.5 on platform are 0.78, 0.82 in a w/o PSD case. But, after setting up the PSD, the effect of PM10 at tunnel is decreased and this results is reflected that the degree of correlation between outside PM and platform PM is decreased. And the relationship is high between PM10 and PM2.5 on platform in a case of without PSD and with PSD Therefore, it could be analogized that the PSD affect the change of air quality on platform  5. CONCLUSION  This study shows the problem of univariate analysis and necessity of multivariate analysis for the interpretation on the air quality change in a subway station. And by using specific process knowledge with data analysis, a more useful interpretation of the indoor air quality can be obtained. It shows the multidimensional correlation between indoor and outdoor air quality and finds the change of the air quality before and after PSD system  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was supported by BK21 project, the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation \(KOSEF funded by the Korea government \(MEST KRF-2009-0076129 Program \(CS070160  REFERENCE

  Picture 6 PCS layout with virtual infrastructure and SAN  The second very important step was the installation and commissioning of a Storage Area Network SAN\, because only a network storage enables to make use of virtualization infrastructure features such as failover. This is due to the fact that virtual machine disk files may not exist on a certain host, as in case of failure it would not be accessible and available any longer to be restarted on a different physical host  SANs are either based on Fibre Channel or iSCSI Technology. The idea of both technologies is to extend the \(usually\nal data lines between hard disk controllers and hard-disks to external devices Fibre Channel has been a proven technology for this type application for years. It has a slightly better performance, but is more expensive than iSCSI iSCSI stands for Internet Small Computer System Interface It  means encapsulation  of the SCSI protocol within TCP/IP packages. Today iSCSI delivers sufficient performance to build up SANs for process automation purposes at a cement works  In such an arrangement, from a failure point of view, the SAN is the most critical peace of hardware in virtualized computer architecture  Although SANs are built up internally fail safe \(redundant power supply, NICs, hard disk controllers,\205 and data sheets give impressive figures for availability, any concept for process control purposes should allow for setting up auto-synchronizing SANs at different spots  User interface VMs running on a host are comparable to applications running on a Terminal Server. In other words, VMs obviously need input and output devices to be handled. Fat clients \(PC\222s\o good choice if it is intended to simplify the maintenance of the process control system hardware. Moreover, they are costly and sometimes prone to error Another step forward -with limited risk only- was to replace some operator stations of a segment by Thin Clients without hard disk The connection between thin client and VM is either done by vendor specific client software, RDP or VNC  Obstacles Minor issues may occur while transferring physical control systems into virtual ones Most of the problems the reference plant encountered had to do with the hardware interfaces such as serial and parallel ports and multi-media features  


Unresolved points \(minor\are to date realizing failover with legacy interfaces and sound output with Windows NT guests   CONCLUSION  Virtualization is no new but a revitalized technol ogy. First virtualization solutions \(purely based on software\ell as computer emulation deliver poor results in terms of performance  Hardware supported virtualization and pure software virtualization are totally different approaches  Virtualization today is most powerful when it combines the strengths of the different technologies. CPU demanding applications are wasting less performance than memory-intense application. \(TLB miss costs  VMware ESX is a good example of this. ESX uses Para-virtualized drivers for the most critical I/O components \(but not for the CPU\, emulation for the le ss important I/O and Binary Translation in order to avoid the high "trap and emulate" performance penalty. In this way, virtualized applications perform quite well, in some cases almost as if th ere were no extra VMM layer involved  The user benefit of virtualization is manifold. Virtualization 225  decouples software from hardware \(provides availability for \223legacy platforms\224, enables software in a cloud 225  utilizes installed hardware more efficient 225  safes space, energy, and invest cost 225  eases system administration extensively  225  but requires additional know-how of system administrators  At this point in time we can say that virtualization has met all of our expectations and offered \226in particular with respect to system administration- even more. The number of plants that started using Virtualization is growing  The process automation staff is still on a learning curve with virtualization in order to take maximum benefit of this technology  Unexploited potential is likely to be found in the field of setting up systems, handling of back-ups and disaster recovery procedures     REFERENCES  200  K.

The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.  For example, errors in distance to the focal plane or tilt also result in a defocus error which cannot be easily recovered in the reconstruction algorithm R EFERENCES  1  C G r o s s, G  P.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship.
