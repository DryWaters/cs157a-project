In this paper we propose a fast and reliable data dissemination protocol Cascades to disseminate data from the sink\(base station to all or a subset of nodes in a data collection sensor network Cascades makes use of the parentmonitor-children analogy to ensure reliable dissemination Each node monitors whether or not its children have received the broadcast messages through snooping children's rebroadcasts or waiting for explicit ACKs If a node detects a gap in its message sequences it can fetch the missing messages from its neighbours reactively Cascades also considers many practical issues for 002eld deployment such as dynamic topology link/node failure etc It therefore guarantees that a disseminated message from the sink will reach all intended receivers and the dissemination is terminated in a short time period Notice that all existing dissemination protocols either do not 
guarantee reliability or do not terminate 1 which does not meet the requirement of real-time command control We conducted experiment evaluations in both TOSSIM simulator and a sensor network testbed to compare Cascades with those existing dissemination protocols in TinyOS sensor networks which show that Cascades achieves a higher degree of reliability lower communication cost and less delivery delay 1 2 T ABLE OF C ONTENTS 1 I NTRODUCTION                                    1 2 R ELATED W ORKS

Several code propagation protocols such as Deluge and Trickle ha v e been de v eloped Ho we v er  as report ed in  although Deluge w orks in lab en vironment it does not work well in 002eld deployment with sparse topology and can not provide 100 reliable code propagation in a short time period It is based on gossip routing which may result in long convergence time particularly in sparse networks Trickle also has similar problems Data dissemination in wireless networks is achieved via each node broadcasting the data to its neighbours taking advantage of the shared wireless medium A naive approach of broadcasting is blind 003ooding  in which each node is required to rebroadcast a packet whenever the packet is received for the 002rst time Blind 003ooding is therefore simple and easy to be implemented However it is likely to generate many redundant transmissions which can cause severe broadcast 
storm congestion Furthermore it cannot guarantee broadcast reliability Reliability of dissemination can be de\002ned as the percentage of all nodes that successfully receive the injected packets Unreliable 003ooding ca n result in slo w setup for query-response applications slow discovery of new routes or incomplete information for target tracking or signal processing And more importantly unreliable data dissemination is unacceptable in code update and user command  control operations Reliable unicast in wireless networks is often implemented via link-layer ARQ automatic repeat-request often via RTS-CTS-data-ACK exchange to guarantee packet delivery However using unicast for data dissemination will cause traf\002c implosion and low ef\002ciency Prior work has 1 
 


sought to improve broadcast reliability either by reducing sources of loss or providing broadcast retransmission Examples of loss reduction include PHY-layer capture MA Clayer optimization and application-laye r jitter  These approaches mitigate transmission collision but can not prevent packet loss completely particularly when the topology is sparse We will discuss more related works in section 2 In this paper we present a fast and reliable data dissemination protocol named Cascades  for the sink-initiated data dissemination Cascades uses the parent-monitor-children analogy to ensure 100 reliability Each node monitors whether or not its children have received each broadcast message through implicit listening techniques e.g snoop child's broadcast or explicit ACKs If not the parent will retransmit until con\002rmed In addition if a child node detects a gap in its packet sequence it can fetch quickly from any neighbour reactively Hence it guarantees that a disseminated message from the sink will reach all intended receivers in wireless network We conducted experiment evaluations in both TOSSIM simulator and an indoor testbed by comparing to those popular dissemination protocols in TinyOS sensor networks The rest of the paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we review recent research work on wireless broadcast in sensor networks In Section 3 we describe the proposed Cascades protocol for reliable and fast data dissemination We then evaluate the system performance in Section 4 Finally we conclude the paper in Section 5 2 R ELATED W ORKS Much research has been done on wireless broadcast in the literature Their major concerns include energy conservation and reliability RBP aim s at pro viding adapti v e reliability for broadcasts in varying network densities and improving the end-to-end reliability of 003ooding It is distributed in the sense that every node makes its own decisions on retransmissions without any global or hard state However it does not offer 100 reliability guarantees Other broadcast protocols such as focus on minimizing the ener gy consumption of the nodes through the minimization of the transmission cost of each broadcast in order to prolong the lifetime of the entire network SmartGossip is a probabilistic protocol that offers broadcast service with low transmission cost SmartGossip automatically and adaptively adjusts transmission probability based on the underlying network topology Its goal was to minimize energy consumption by reducing redundant transmissions However it cannot provide 100 reliability neither Bayesian-Assisted Resource Discovery In Sensor Network BARD uses stochastic processes to model both the searching and the routing components in the data dissemination process and it also uses prior history knowledge and the characteristic con\002guration of diffusion to avoid unnecessary 003ooding of related queries When historic information is available BARD is quickly and ef\002ciently able to perform however BARD is limited by traditional 003ooding techniques when this information is not available Spatiotemporal Multicasting or mobicast allo ws the deli v ery of messages to a group of mobile destinations In order to accomplish their goals of delivering the data to a mobile destination it was necessary that the reliability constraints for mobicast be reduced  classi\002es e xisti ng broadcast schemes into cate gories and simulates a subset of each category providing a condensed but comprehensive side by side comparison It determines the strength and weakness of each type as well as the situation\(s in which each type is most suitable In the author in v estigated and discovered tight bounds on both the broadcast capacity and the information diffusion rate in wireless networks for both dense and extended populations 002 log  n  000 013 2  was determined to be a lower bound of broadcast rate for a continuous data stream using a multi-hop implementation in extended networks Furthermore the authors also proved that constant diffusion 002\(1  of data is possible in both dense and extended networks PSFQ Pump Slowly Fetch Quickly is a reliable transport protocol It guarantees the reliability of downstream transmissions by fast fetching packets from neighbouring nodes after a packet sequence gap is detected When loss event is triggered one NACK message will be broadcasted However PSFQ requires the sink node inject messages into network at a relative slow rate The authors also indicate the importance of hop-by-hop error recovery where loss detection and recovery should be limited to a small number of hops ideally one hop due to the probability of losing packets accumulates exponentially with the number of hops GARUDA uses Core-Reco v ery idea to implement reliable downstream data delivery Some nodes in the network play the role as loss recovery servers and other non-core nodes need to have one-hop connection with at least one core nodes GARUDA works in two-stage recovery in the 002rst stage downstream core nodes recover missing packets from upstream core nodes when packet loss is detected in the second stage non-core nodes recover missing packet from their neighbour core nodes Trickle uses a probabilistic or 223gossiping\224 approach which utilizes meta-data in order to discover and repair missing data Hence theoretically it eventually provides 100 reliability But it might take a long time to converge Deluge builds off Trickle and is the def ault code update protocol in TinyOS In Trickle nodes stay up-to-date by occasionally broadcasting a code summary to their neighbours Trickle's key contribution is the use of suppression and dynamic adjustment of the broadcast rate to limit transmissions among neighbouring nodes While Trickle addresses single packet dissemination Deluge extends it to support large data objects However according to 4 Delu ge 1 is unable to pro vide reliable network programming in a 002eld deployment 2 
 


3 C ASCADES P ROTOCOL D ESIGN Sink-initiated data dissemination usually carries crucial command  control information or binary image code Meanwhile packet loss could happen due to poor link quality or transmission collision Hence it is necessary to ensure 100 reliable delivery and the dissemination process should terminate in acceptable time period Otherwise from a user viewpoint it is a system failure or even worse For instance in a feedback-driven volcano monitoring sensor network the connected science model may generate control commands to increase sampling rate of sensor nodes in real-time when some monitored area becomes more active Those feedback commands have to be received by all expected sensor nodes in the right order with reasonable delay bound Motivated by those needs from real systems we designed the Cascades protocol for reliable and fast data dissemination We assume that 1 the network traf\002c and link quality is dynamic though nodes are not mobile 2 communication links could be asymmetric.The MAC protocol can be any existing MAC protocol as long as it supports broadcast We assume a data gathering routing protocol is available in the system such as MultihopLQI and Drain in TinyOS and there are continuous data 003ow from sensors to the sink Each node has the knowledge of its parent and can learn its direct children by tracking recent forwarded\(upstream packets It is possible that children set may be outdated if children switch parents without noti\002cations As is shown in appendix and theorem 1 Cascades has considered problems caused by dynamic topology Cascades uses a topology management component to detect and manage topology changes Cascades is designed for environment monitoring sensor networks to achieve following goals 1 to ensure that all data segments are delivered to all the intended receivers with 100 reliability 2 to ensure that a broadcast session terminates in a reasonable short time period instead of gossiping forever 3 to minimize the transmission cost for reliable packet delivery and the signalling overhead for missing packets detection and recovery 4 to operate correctly even in an environment where the radio link quality is very poor 5 to operate reliably in practical system applications where nodes and java client software could die and restart and there may be multiple clients that inject data into the network The Cascades protocol ensures 100 reliability by implementing parent-monitor-children analogy and reactive fetch mechanism if the re is g ap in pack et sequence which denotes missing packets The parent-children relationship is extracted from the data collection routing tree on the 003y We also apply a update mechanism to update the relationship and thus make Cascades resilient and responsive to dynamic topology When a sensor node forwards a packet for a child a counter for that child is set to a maximum value 016  When the update timer 002res the counter is decreased by one If 016 reaches 0  it removes the child from the children set There is a tradeoff between the responsiveness to topology change and the protocol robustness With a smaller 016  topology change can be detected with a shorter latency However sometimes a sensor node may fail to receive packets successfully from a child for certain period due to network congestion It is observed from our test bed that sometimes some part of the network is 223frozen\224 for up to a few seconds because of high contention That is to say no packets from the nodes in that part of the network arrive at the sink during that period We choose 016  6 seconds based on our experimental test The essential algorithm works as follows see detailed pseudo-code in the appendix 1 For a non-leaf node u  it will send an ACK back to its parent node once it detects all intended children have rebroadcasted the message implicit ACK or con\002rmed with an explicit ACK otherwise it retries periodically If u is a leaf node it sends back ACK once a new message is received or snooped 2 If a node detects a gap in its received data sequence it will broadcast a request e.g NACK message to notify its parent Each node rebroadcasts periodically until successful reception is con\002rmed by all intended children either through rebroadcast or explicit ACK Observant reader might wonder what if there are asymmetric links parent can not reach children or children can not reach parent Notice that if this happens permanently a correct data gathering routing protocol shall have updated the data gathering tree due to failed link layer acknowledgement This is another reason why we extract parent-children relationship from data gathering tree In our implementation we have designed a TopologyMgmt module which connects to routing module and learns the knowledge of the parent and the children set In addition the TopologyMgmt module snoops packets in neighbourhood discovers and maintains neighbour connectivity hence it can detect a node's joining or leaving in short time period and notify the routing and Cascades module When Cascades module is informed that a child node joins/leaves it updates C u  If a node changes its parent Cascades sends out a message to notify the old parent On the other hand Cascades protocol is a fast opportunistic data dissemination protocol which is as fast as 003ooding The broadcast 003ow does not completely depend on the data gathering tree structure A snooped new message from neighbor nodes will be accepted and rebroadcasted if necessary Therefore it is possible that a parent 002rst hears new data from its child before it hears it from its parent It speeds up the dissemination process For example in Figure 1 node a is the parent of node b and f  However node a s data reaches node b only then b rebroadcasts the data to its neighbors also as an implicit ACK to node a  At the same time node h receives data from node l though l is not node h s parent and rebroadcasts the data to its neighbors which includes par3 
 


ent node f  Additionally due to the opportunistic dissemination protocol a non-leaf node may suppress its own rebroadcasting as long as all of its children have ACKed explicitly or implicitly to reduce communication cost For example in Figure 1 assume node a s DATA does not reach f  but node h s ACK and node g s DATA have reached f  then f sends an ACK to a without further re-broadcast It is not dif\002cult to imagine that the opportunistic design makes the protocol not just faster  but also more robust as a node does not only rely on its parent node to get disseminated data If the link reliability between a parent and child is temporarily not good it still has a good chance of getting the data from some other neighbor nodes We described the algorithm details with pseudo-code in appendix for readers who are interested in implementing and comparing Some ef\002cient approaches were utilized to speed up dissemination and reduce communication cost For example when node u receives a data message from node x  it adds node x to u s acked children set even if x is not in u s children set It will bene\002t when node x may become a child of node u later in which case adding x to u s acked children set in advance reduces some communication cost and increases system robustness Another example is no matter whether u is the parent of node x or not node x will send ACK message to u as long as it is in the unacked children set of u  This ACK message which indicates the current parent of x has changed will prevent node u from retrying forever Figur e 1  Illustration of opportunistic broadcast 003ow in a tree with Cascades protocol The solid lines sketch the tree structure and the dashed lines shows the other network links Theorem 1 Cascades protocol provides 100 reliable data dissemination service from the sink to the entire network Proof The Cascades protocol achieves 100 reliability by implementing the parent-monitor-children analogy In the data gathering tree each node monitors whether or not its children receive the disseminated data Each child node noti\002es its parent of successful reception through implicit or explicit ACKs 1 Implicit ACK Parent node snoops packets from children If a child rebroadcasts the same disseminated packet it implicitly means that the child has received the packet 2 Explicit ACK If the parent failed to snoop the implicit ACK naturally it will rebroadcast the data after the timeout period Then the child must reply a short explicit ACK message if the child has previously received same data but it is still in the parent's un-acked children set As long as any child fails to ACK implicitly or explicitly the parent will rebroadcast periodically until every child has con\002rmed the reception Hence reliability is guaranteed as long as the network is consistent Figur e 2  Illustration of possible inconsistent parent-child relationship during route update period However it is possible that a node switches parents during a data dissemination session Since each node maintains its own parent and children set distributively a pair of nodes may have inconsistent information For instance as shown in Figure 2 node b takes g as its child but node g has already switched parents from node b to node f  The possible inconsistencies can be classi\002ed as one or both of the following 1 Case 1 Node g takes node f as its parent but node f does not take node g as its child 2 Case 2 Node b takes node g as its child but node g does not take node b as its parent Cascades overcomes these inconsistencies by having each node send a REQU EST message to its new parent for missed data if it exists each time it switches parents Thus the inconsistencies of Case 1 are mitigated since each child explicitly asks for and is provided with missed data if any exists from its new parent Also node f adds node g to its children set at this point For Case 2  the only negative effect is that node b will retry even though node g is not its child In algorithm 1 node b will terminate the retry after receiving ACK  seq f  from node g  as long as it happens Node b then realizes that node g has switched parents to node f  and removes node g from its children set C b  Notice that as mentioned before those temporary parent-children inconsistency will also be solved by the TopologyMgmt after a prede\002ned time period Hence even if there are temporary asymmetric links e.g child cannot hear parent or parent cannot hear child they will not retry forever In summary Cascades protocol can handle those inconsistency robustly and provide 100 reliability In Cascades we have not discussed how to choose appropri4 
 


ate time interval to accelerate the dissemination speed and minimize communication cost at the same time without sacri\002ce of reliability In Algorithm 1 dt wait is a parent node's wait time interval for its children implicit or explicit acknowledgements before broadcasting the message again If dt wait is too large the data dissemination rate will be slow On the other hand if dt wait is too small it will cause signi\002cant broadcast congestion waste bandwidth and degrade the dissemination rate due to collisions Our solution is to let dt wait be adaptive to the network situations We rede\002ne the dependency in by time-dependenc y to help decide the v alue of dt wait  If node x receives a new packet i from some non-parent nodes before receiving the packet i from its parent node x will decrease its dependency on its parent by value 013  After receiving packet i from its parent node x will start a timer with interval t  Node x will also decrease its dependency on its parent by value f if it receives packet i from some non-parent nodes within t time period When timer 002res node x rebroadcast the packet i and keep dependency value unchanged until next new packet's arrival In our implementation 013 is 10 and f is 5  the maximum and minimum dependency value is 60 and 0  The parent node decides dt wait based on the dependency value from its children  dt wait  100 highest dependency value of children in millisecond unit Practical Issues Considerations It is possible that there are multiple user clients on Internet that are authorized to send control commands to the sensor network In order to solve such a race condition and guarantee the consistency of command sequence number increment the command sequence number should be set just before commands are injected into the network In our implementation the problem has been solved by an add-on in the SerialForwarder program in TinyOS SerialForwarder forwards network packets to the Ethernet and distributes commands for multiple clients to the sensor network Hence we maintain the sequence number of Cascades message in SerialForwarder instead of clients and keep command and control message's sequence number increase consistently In a real sensor network deployment the sensor node and java client software can die and restart by watchdog or user Like TCP protocol to guarantee reliability Cascades has to deal with connectivity management and sequence number synchronization issues However unlike TCP which is for oneto-one reliable connection Cascades is designed for one-tomany communication The connectivity management for sequence number synchronization in one-to-many communication is expensive and dif\002cult if not impossible In our volcano monitor sensor network system Cascades component resets its sequence number to 0 if it is idle for 10 minutes With this mechanism in place even if the nodes lost synchronization they can re-synchronize the sequence number in 10 minutes Then if a node with sequence number 0 receives a command with larger sequence number they will adjust its sequence number to this larger sequence number and synchronize with the SerialForwarder 4 P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION Figur e 3  Cascades implementation in TinyOS We conducted simulation in network simulator TOSSIM  to e v aluate its ef 002ci enc y and scalability  as w ell as e xperiments in a real sensor network testbed to evaluate its robustness and reliability We evaluated the performance by running the Surge application in TinyOS Surge is a multi-hop data collection application based on a simple distance-vector routing protocol MultiHopLQI Each node periodically generates data packets and delivers them to a gateway hence the data 003ow forms a treelike topology rooted at the gateway TopologyMgmt module maintains the neighborhood connectivity and parent-children information by leveraging MultiHopLQI As is illustrated in Figure 3 CascadesM is the main module for Cascades all broadcast data packets and control packets are processed in this module GeneriComm is link layer component that connects CascadesM to the default CSMA-based MAC protocol In our simulation the Surge application generated and transmitted one data packet every second This simulated the real situation that upstream data packets will compete bandwidth with downstream broadcasting packets The sink node injected one packet into the network every 034 time interval We compared the performance of Cascades to Drip Drip based on Trickle is a transport-laye r component in T in yOS for epidemically disseminating messages throughout the network After sending a message Drip will continuously retransmit to ensure that it eventually reaches all expected node in the network In Drip a node delays its own transmission after receiving duplicate packets from neighbouring nodes The following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of Cascades Protocol 1 Reliability which measures the number of received packets to the number of sink-injected packets in different time checking points Time checking point is the time when the number of received packets is examined r i is the number of 5

  Picture 6 PCS layout with virtual infrastructure and SAN  The second very important step was the installation and commissioning of a Storage Area Network SAN\, because only a network storage enables to make use of virtualization infrastructure features such as failover. This is due to the fact that virtual machine disk files may not exist on a certain host, as in case of failure it would not be accessible and available any longer to be restarted on a different physical host  SANs are either based on Fibre Channel or iSCSI Technology. The idea of both technologies is to extend the \(usually\nal data lines between hard disk controllers and hard-disks to external devices Fibre Channel has been a proven technology for this type application for years. It has a slightly better performance, but is more expensive than iSCSI iSCSI stands for Internet Small Computer System Interface It  means encapsulation  of the SCSI protocol within TCP/IP packages. Today iSCSI delivers sufficient performance to build up SANs for process automation purposes at a cement works  In such an arrangement, from a failure point of view, the SAN is the most critical peace of hardware in virtualized computer architecture  Although SANs are built up internally fail safe \(redundant power supply, NICs, hard disk controllers,\205 and data sheets give impressive figures for availability, any concept for process control purposes should allow for setting up auto-synchronizing SANs at different spots  User interface VMs running on a host are comparable to applications running on a Terminal Server. In other words, VMs obviously need input and output devices to be handled. Fat clients \(PC\222s\o good choice if it is intended to simplify the maintenance of the process control system hardware. Moreover, they are costly and sometimes prone to error Another step forward -with limited risk only- was to replace some operator stations of a segment by Thin Clients without hard disk The connection between thin client and VM is either done by vendor specific client software, RDP or VNC  Obstacles Minor issues may occur while transferring physical control systems into virtual ones Most of the problems the reference plant encountered had to do with the hardware interfaces such as serial and parallel ports and multi-media features  


Unresolved points \(minor\are to date realizing failover with legacy interfaces and sound output with Windows NT guests   CONCLUSION  Virtualization is no new but a revitalized technol ogy. First virtualization solutions \(purely based on software\ell as computer emulation deliver poor results in terms of performance  Hardware supported virtualization and pure software virtualization are totally different approaches  Virtualization today is most powerful when it combines the strengths of the different technologies. CPU demanding applications are wasting less performance than memory-intense application. \(TLB miss costs  VMware ESX is a good example of this. ESX uses Para-virtualized drivers for the most critical I/O components \(but not for the CPU\, emulation for the le ss important I/O and Binary Translation in order to avoid the high "trap and emulate" performance penalty. In this way, virtualized applications perform quite well, in some cases almost as if th ere were no extra VMM layer involved  The user benefit of virtualization is manifold. Virtualization 225  decouples software from hardware \(provides availability for \223legacy platforms\224, enables software in a cloud 225  utilizes installed hardware more efficient 225  safes space, energy, and invest cost 225  eases system administration extensively  225  but requires additional know-how of system administrators  At this point in time we can say that virtualization has met all of our expectations and offered \226in particular with respect to system administration- even more. The number of plants that started using Virtualization is growing  The process automation staff is still on a learning curve with virtualization in order to take maximum benefit of this technology  Unexploited potential is likely to be found in the field of setting up systems, handling of back-ups and disaster recovery procedures     REFERENCES  200  K.

The distance of the reflected beam from the center of the aperture is then used to calculate I  which varies from about -0.8\260 to +0.8\260 in the experiment Figures 24-28 show the change r I    found by taking the difference of the center of each spectral image and subtracting from its location when I and compared the modeled values over the same range of I Figure 23 illustrates that there is some amount of random error in these measurements, but overa ll the data is grouped around r 0 pixel difference between the measured and modeled values.

The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.  For example, errors in distance to the focal plane or tilt also result in a defocus error which cannot be easily recovered in the reconstruction algorithm R EFERENCES  1  C G r o s s, G  P.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
