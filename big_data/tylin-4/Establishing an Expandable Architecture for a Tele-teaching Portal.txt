christoph.meinel@hpi.uni-potsdam.de Abstract The complexity of web applications becomes a big problem when applications are growing Especially if new algorithms should be tested and compared it is important to be able to separate the newly implemented functions from the core system It is not enough to use standard frameworks to handle this but to plan a maintainable structure for the application This paper describes how a maintainable structure can be planned and implemented by using the Django framework while trying to avoid a big programming overhead.The new architecture for the main features and its advantages and disadvantages is described together with an example for a 
rating plug-in An outlook on the possibilities for future developments using this architecture is provided as well Keywords plug-in architecture tele-teaching Django rating I I NTRODUCTION When designing a real world internet application which is used by a big amount of users it is important to have a stable basis to start with It is important to assure at all time that the primary functions work well and extra functions do not disturb the functionality As the tele-teaching portal is an academic project it is also important to be able to compare different solutions and test new algorithm For a tele-teaching portal there are two 
main research elds On the one hand there are all kinds of interaction with the users User interactions is one of the aspects for future developments in web applications Therefore there has to be an easy solution for the integration of community features like rating or tagging 3 Thereby this function should be integrated into the core functionality for a generation of a seamless usage experience On the other hand a lot of research focuses on improvement of the search of data For the implementation of search algorithms for video lectures a lot of meta data is needed This data can be generated from the audio and video data  as well as be pro vided by the users Ev en statistical data 
can be used There is a lot of research which integrates these different approaches No w adays a lot of implementations using semantic web technologies are proposed Therefore this paper will start with some information about the application and a short deìnition of plug-ins Afterwards the two approaches for the architecture without and with plug-ins are described and the advantages and disadvantages of the usage of plug-ins are named At the end there is an overview of the future work which is enabled through the architecture A About the tele-TASK Portal The implemented tele-teaching portal tele-TASK 1 
provides a large amount of lectures and videos most of them held at the HPI The videos are captured with one audio and two video streams allowing separated video streams for the lecturer and the digital presentation The capturing system which is used since 2002 allows to create a huge number of recordings of lectures without much effort The video portal itself is the platform for providing the generated video content to the whole world allowing everybody to view a high percentage of the lectures held at our institute Nearly 3000 lectures can be found To make it easier for the user to nd videos about particular topics many of the lectures are split into handy video clips with 
extra meta data All this data establishes a good basis for doing research with real data and real users B What is a Plug-in Many web-frameworks use the term plug-in sometimes also called add-on even if they donêt offer anything which could be named plug-in That is a reason why many web application developers have a wrong association for this term In this paper plug-ins are deìned as in classical software development A plug-in can be seen as a special interface description This interface deìnes some functions or classes which can be used by developers to extend the basic software Big 
software with a lot of options for usage use this concept to make their software more exible For example it is possible to write plug-ins for the web browser refox to enhance the functionalities of the web browser There is even software like eclipse which consists of pure These interfaces enable a developer to write functions which will automatically be included inside the system without any further changes on the core system However 1 http://www.tele-task.de

in the context of web applications the term plug-in is often used for libraries which can be plugged in a system and used by the developer which is not the original idea of a plug-in In fact plug-in architecture means an inversion of control Not the author of the plug-in knows when the plug-in is used instead the developer who writes the interface for the plug-in knows what will be done with it and describes the needed data and functions But he does not have to know how these functions will be implemented For example the interface developer writes an interface for data enhancement He only knows that he will get enhanced data but he does not know who will do it and what exactly will be done This concept of plug-ins is known from many other problems Many  describe ho w the y implement their own plug-in architecture or use existing interfaces Nevertheless it is hardly known to web developers and most big web frameworks do not include mechanisms for using a plug-in architecture So it is required to build it by hand II C LASSICAL A PPROACH FOR A T ELE T EACHING P ORTAL The tele-TASK portal has been running for some years now and has undergone some major changes In summer 2009 there was the chance to do a complete restart using new technologies This restart allowed to redesign the database On top of the experiences with the old portal there was also the decision to build more modules and separate the functions In this section at rst there is a short description of the used framework Django Afterwards follows the description how the project would have been built without a plug-in architecture A The Concept of Django Django 2 is an open source web application framework It is based on the python programming language and implements the MVC 3 pattern To be precisely it is called MTVpattern in Django because the parts of the application are named model template and view These three terms describe the most important parts of the Django system The following short descriptions give an overview of the characteristics of Django to understand the following sections Models Models are the representation of the data which can be stored in different types of databases Therefore it is a mapping of database tables to classes and table entries to objects Models also provide the possibility to add helper functions For example it is possible to create a function which converts a date into another format 2 http://www.djangoproject.com 3 MVC-Pattern Design pattern Model-View-Controller postulates the separation of the application in data program logic and display They also help with the abstraction of some database design pattern and hide overhead database tables like connection tables between two data tables Views The task of the view is to collect the required data and provide it Therefore it is possible to create a string containing the HTML code or use a template which is a HTML le with special template syntax The second approach is the usual one Using templates a view gets the data from the models and prepares it for the template which will be rendered The views are also the access point for the URLs In a special conìg le there are deìnitions which URL will call which view with the speciìed parameters The conìg le also provides the possibility to create abstract names for the precise URLs so that the developer does not have to know which URLs will be used in the end The developers only use the names for the URLs Templates Normally templates are plain HTML les with a few template tags for variable output and loopings over lists It is also possible to do some extra formatting on the variables using lters such as transforming the format of a time stamp Another possibility to extend templates is the usage of template tags With the help of these tags it is possible to insert every type of function inside the template Internally in Django templates are interpreted as trees consisting of different nodes Each template tag creates a new node in the tree It is possible that these template tags are nested Thus a complex tree of tags can be produced Because of this structure each template tag has to produce exactly one node which implements a render function Furthermore it is allowed that this generated template node contains other template nodes as children B Structure of a Modularized Application for the tele-TASK Portal Without a Plug-in Architecture When designing an application it is a good concept to create modules for the different tasks An important feature of these modules is access limitation and loosely coupling As we tried to separate the modules by tasks the result was modules like the login and proìle managing module mytt the search module or the module for rating see gure 1 Using a non-plug-in solution there will be a bidirectional connection between almost all modules This happens because on the one hand the core pages including the main entrance page of the application need to have references to the enhancement modules pages so that the user of the application can reach all functions A case in point is the search dialogue on the main page for an easy access of the search function It is also possible that additional modules provide information which should

core search rating    mytt        Figure 1 Extract of the structure without using plug-ins be displayed on the core pages For instance the ratings of a lecture should be visible and perhaps editable on the page of the lecture On the other hand the additional modules have to use the data of the basic modules It is obvious that most modules use the data of videos or lectures for their own functions They will also use functions of the core module for editing and displaying the data to get a consistent application The modules do not only communicate with the core module but also with each other For example there will be a search for play lists included inside the normal search for lectures and videos It should also be possible to order the search results using the ratings of the content The mytt module will be required as connection point by every other module which provides special functions for logged-in users The resulting problem is that for every new module you have to change existing other modules It is obvious that this will exponentially increase the complexity of the whole application It is also not possible to remove a module or exchange it without touching the other components III C ONCEPT FOR A PLUG IN ARCHITECTURE The idea for the extendable application is that the basic modules do not have to know anything about the specialized modules In the end there will be a hierarchy of modules like in gure 2 core utils search rating     mytt    Figure 2 New structure of modules with plug-ins As you can see only specialized modules use data and interfaces of the more common modules The basic modules only provide plug-in points which can be used by the specialized modules With this structure there is no problem extending the application with new functions without touching any of the core modules It is also easily possible to remove a plug-in module which is not needed by any other modules therefore is a leaf of the hierarchy tree To get such a structure two changes of the concepts are needed The rst one is the extension of the views by providing an interface for templates and a plug-in class mechanism The second one is a design approach for the extension of data A Extending the view Django has no built-in concept for designing plug-ins for extending the views It is a task for the developer to implement his own plug-in system A good approach to start with is to look at the programming language Python in which Django is implemented In Python there are a lot of ideas on how to design a plugin system An easy solution is to use the knowledge of a class about its subclasses With this idea everything you need is just a base class which is capable of querying all its subclasses An implementation of this approach can be found in listing 1 1 class PluginBase\(type 2 def __init__\(cls name bases attrs 3 pass 4 5 def get_plugins\(self 6 plugins  list 7 for sc in self.__subclasses__ 8 plugins.append\(sc 9 add  sc.get_plugins 10 for s in add 11 plugins.append\(s 12 return plugins Listing 1 Simple version of class PluginBase This listing contains only a small snippet Of course it is better to do some extra checking if the subclass is really suitable and well formed 1 import settings 2 3 for installedApp in settings.INSTALLED_APPS 4 try  5 __import__\(installedApp  plugins 6 except Exception e 7  8 9  Find template names of plug-ins 10  Listing 2 Function for loading plug-ins The problem is that a class has knowledge only about those subclasses which have been used or included somewhere in the application So the most convenient way to assure all subclasses are known is initializing them 
325 
 


when starting the Django server Therefore we use the INSTALLED APPS setting see listing 2 which contains all available modules and is used for other initializations as well Then every known plug-in is accessible and can be used inside a Python function or class For addressing a plug-in from the template it is required to write a special template tag Preparation for template tags A template tag is a function which returns a template node object These objects offer the necessary render function which usually creates HTML data for displaying inside the web browser 1 class PluginTemplateNode\(template.Node 2 pluginTemplateName  base 3 4 def __init__\(self data tName   5 if data 6 self.data  template.Variable\(data 7 else  8 self.data  None 9 self.templateName  tName 10 11 def render\(self context 12 data  None 13 if self.data 14 data  self.data.resolve\(context 15 if self.templateName and len\(self templateName  0 16 t  get_template\(self.templateName 17 return t.render\(context 18 return  19 20 __metaclass__  PluginBase Listing 3 class PluginTemplateNode Therefore it is important that each plug-in class which is used for a template plug-in inherits from the template node class So it is convenient to write a base class like PluginTemplateNode see listing 3 with some handy functions which uses PluginBase as meta class 1  show_plugin LectureInfo lecture  Listing 4 Using plug-ins inside templates The class variable pluginTemplateName is used to get a unique identiìer for using in the template tag In listing 4 the usage of a plug-in for additional infos about lectures is show The corresponding PluginTemplateNode class will have the value LectureInfo for pluginTemplateName Because plug-ins can create more than one template node but only one template node is allowed to be returned by a template tag it is the easiest solution to have a template node which collects all of the plug-in template nodes and renders them when its own render function is called see listing 5 With these two classes a general template tag can be written easily by retrieving all plug-in classes which inherit from PluginTemplateNode and append them to a PluginColNode object which will be returned by the template tag 1 class PluginColNode\(Node 2 def __init__\(self 3 self.plugins  list 4 5 def append\(self node 6 self.plugins.append\(node 7 8 def render\(self context 9 renderresult   10 for p in self.plugins 11 if isinstance\(p PluginTemplateNode 12 res  p.render\(context 13 if res is not None 14 renderresult  renderresult  res 15 return renderresult Listing 5 class PluginColNode B Extending the Models It is not enough to only extend the view of the application because it is a normal use case to have additional data The normal database approach is to construct a new table and add a foreign key to the existing table to connect the data As long as you only want to extend one table this is a valid construction If you want to extend more than one table with the same feature you have to use a generic relation see gure 3 Table1 ID some attributes  Table2 ID some attributes  GenericObjectTable ObjectTyp ObjectId some other attributes    ManagementTable ID NameOfTable   Figure 3 Database structure for generic relations This concept which is part of the Django distribution allows to create a foreign key to multiple database tables by saving the type of the table and the id of the object Because Django handles all database requests the database structure and the management table are invisible to the application developer and generic foreign keys can be used almost like normal foreign keys C Example Rating-Functionality as Use Case for Plug-ins The rating functionality is one feature that ought to be implemented as plug-in in a tele-teaching portal because it is no core functionality and should therefore only be implemented in a module that can be switched on to work with the core application see gure 4 In the context of the rating of media items rating is the quantiìcation of the personally perceived quality of an item 
326 
 


Figure 4 on the top rating disabled thereunder rating enabled In the tele-teaching context there are several layers where rating can be applied Usually a tele-teaching portal consists of lecture recordings that are mostly embedded in a larger context for example the course which runs a whole semester Furthermore the lectures are often subdivided into smaller pieces This is done in order to facilitate the usage of mobile players where the content needs to be downloaded for pod-casting and also to simplify a more precise meta-data collection and search As all the three layers include teleteaching content all of them should be rateable individually A rating will be stored in the database with the help of a new model that extends the core model base The model rating combines the information of the rated content item information about the user who posted the rating the date when it was posted and the value of the rate see gure 5 The content item is referenced via the combination of contentType and objectID  This so-called generic foreign key enables a exible referencing of different content types on the application That results in a rating functionality that could easily be adapted to not only work with series lectures and segments but also with new content types like play lists Lecture ID some attributes  Series ID some attributes  Rating contentType objectId rating profile   Segment ID some attributes      Figure 5 Database structure for rating There are multiple places where the ratings can be used to enhance the user interface The result of the rating should be shown in all places where the content items that can be rated are previewed like the search page and overview pages in the video archive and its categories The possibility to rate should also be given on all pages related to the content item like the lecture details page and the video display page This is necessary to ensure easy access and visibility of the functionality for the users The rating interface checks the login status to forbid participation of anonymous users For the users to manage their actions in the personal area of the portal called MyTT an interface for managing ones own votes is required Deleting and altering of votes should be allowed here The functionality for all plug-ins is implemented by extending the core view collection with new views An interface from which all plug-ins might inherit is implemented within the core part of the application There are two different plug-ins that offer the display of rating results and the rating interface with one interface implemented in the core application for each of them One plug-in only displays a smaller version of the rating results on overview pages see image 4 The second plug-in implements both a normal-sized display of the results and the rating interface It is used on all detail pages for content items and videos The integration of the functionality into the standard templates works via the usage of template tags At the place where the output of the rating is supposed to appear a template tag which calls the rating plug-in and passes the content item whose rating should be displayed is included see listing 6 1  div class ratings 2  show_plugin Rating lecture  3  div  Listing 6 Integration of the rating plug-in via template tag MyTT offers its own plug-in interface for the integration of sub-pages One interface function realizes a menu link in MyTT the other a visual link button in the interface Both link to the plugged-in sub-page Two rating plug-ins inherit from these functions to integrate the Manage my Ratings interface into MyTT IV A DVANTAGES AND D ISADVANTAGES As every technology plug-ins have their advantages and disadvantages and it depends on the use case if it is a good choice to use them We gained these facts by collecting the experiences of the 10 developers in our teams who started with different knowledge about architecture The following disadvantages became apparent within the project  Learning Tasks The time for orientation is increased A new developer has to learn the basic concepts of plug-ins and must be taught to follow the rules for new implementations Therefore higher development skills are needed 
327 
 


 Overhead for small tasks A small link can need a whole function or class to be implemented instead of just changing the HTML le  High complexity for small projects If there are only one or two functions which are capable for plug-ins and it is known that the application wonêt grow plugins are not needed On the other hand there are a lot of advantages  Easy on and off switching of functionality If any plugin produces errors it can easily be disabled Disabling defective plug-ins works automatically as well It is also possible to replace functions with better implementations  Different status for development and running system It is possible to develop functions and have the code inside the project but to disable them for the live application  Module separation The modules are separated therefore it is easier to outsource some tasks by deìning the interfaces Furthermore this allows the production of smaller and larger versions of a system without any changes in the implementation  Less knowledge of the system needed Developers for plug-ins need no knowledge of the core system they only need the speciìcation for the interfaces they are using This reduces the learning effort So for bigger projects this overcompensate the time for understanding the plug-in concept  Decreasing complexity In bigger projects the design overhead is relatively small Furthermore it saves redundant tests inside the templates and views and decreases complexity of the project  Smaller inîuence on the different development tasks Because not every developer has to use every plug-in it is easier to ignore developments in the initial stage In our project we concluded that the few disadvantages do not outweigh the advantages It needs some time for the developers to get used to the paradigms After that phase the developers think in a different way when designing their modules and would hardly miss the possibilities they gained V C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK The actual implementation has been integrated into the portal and is used for over half a year now The next step is to encapsulate the functionality of plug-ins into an easy-to-use project which can be used project-independent This project will be shared with the Django community This would allow to gain more experiences with the plug-in architecture These experiences should be collected so it can be checked whether this approach is capable for other projects as well Also one project team at our research group is waiting to test the architecture themselves Aside the plug-in architecture should be a a tool for future work There are a lot of ideas whose implementation is enabled through the architecture A big task is the implementation of the basic search features There are two points where plug-ins are needed First there are a lot of different types of objects which can be searched In the core system there are series lectures segments and persons but later there must be also a search for play lists or other data The second point is the deìnition of how the search should work The core search will be capable to search the core meta data of a lecture or series But with more meta data generated in different ways like audio or OCR analysis it is important to enhance the possibilities of the search engine and to improve the queries When this base search functionality is implemented it should be used for further enhancements on the base of the different types of meta data available It is planned to give more information about relations between different lectures or series There will be also other possibilities opened up by plugins like the embedding of more community features which will give new approaches for research We plan to allow the users to provide more meta data using tags and to evaluate if this data is useful for enriching the user experiences of the portal R EFERENCES  M Jazayeri Some trends in web application de v elopment  in FOSE 07 2007 Future of

101 6 Similarly, taking the transpose of this filter and applying it to the image will yield the gradient matrix for the vertical direction the image is calculated through the following expression 22 yxmagnorm GGGG +==                     \(7 This magnitude is then normalized across the image, similar to the previous calculation for sum squared difference  magG magmag GG   8 7 Figures 13 and 14 show similar plots as Figures 6 and 7 Here, one notices that the error increases more sharply as the perturbations vary from the nominal position.  However as one perturbs farther and farther from the nominal, the error begins to oscillate rather than smoothly increase  Figure 13.   Angle perturbations using magnitude of gradient approach.  The predicted image is independently perturbed in roll, pitch, and yaw about the nominal pre-contact position.  The minimum error should occur where the images are best correlated  Figure 14.   Translation perturbations using magnitude of gradient approach.  The predicted image is independently perturbed in the x, y, and z body axes about the nominal pre-contact position Figure 15 shows a similar surface as seen in Figure 8, but where the correlation technique was to compare magnitude of gradient.  Here, one sees that the error increases more rapidly than the sum-squared difference method when the image deviates from the nominal position.  There is a distinct, sharp minimum indicating the nominal location  Figure 15.   Example surface generated using magnitude of gradient approach by perturbing both the x-axis translation and amount of roll simultaneously at the pre-contact position.  The sharp minimum indicates good observability Additional surfaces are shown in Figures 16-18.  Each of these modes shows numerous local minima, thus making the optimal position difficult to determine.  With multiple modes showing this type of behavior, the magnitude of gradient approach alone would not be a robust enough technique for precise error detection   Figure 16.  Example surface generated using magnitude of gradient approach by perturbing both the y-axis translation and the amount of yaw simultaneously at the pre-contact position.  There are many local minima, indicating poor observability 8  Figure 17.  Example surface generated using magnitude of gradient by perturbing both y-axis translation and the amount of roll simultaneously at the pre-contact position.  Again, multiple minima cause observability problems  Figure 18.  Example surface generated using magnitude of gradient approach by perturbing both z-axis perturbation and the amount of pitch simultaneously at the pre-contact position Oscillations throughout this mode cause minima 


Oscillations throughout this mode cause minima across the surface which could generate significant difficulties in image correlation Now examining the magnitude of gradient technique while at the contact position, Figure 19 shows rather poor observability to the errors, but there is a distinct minimum at the nominal location.  If the errors begin very near the optimal position, then this approach could find the correct minimum.  Figure 20 mimics the behavior of Figures 9 and 12, demonstrating that x-axis translation error coupled with pitch error proves to be difficult to detect   Figure 19.  Example surface generated using magnitude of gradient by perturbing both x-axis translation and the amount of roll simultaneously at the contact position.  There is poor observability across most of the surface, except for the very distinct minimum at the optimal location  Figure 20.  Example surface generated using magnitude of gradient approach by perturbing both x-axis perturbation and the amount of pitch simultaneously at the contact position.  Similar to Figures 9 and 12, there is poor observability with this mode, including a  valley  in the surface Magnitude of Gradient with Threshold For a third approach, the same magnitude of gradient is computed for each image, but the magnitudes are then filtered based on a threshold technique.  Through experimentation, a threshold is found that will amplify strong areas of gradient magnitude.  Each pixel in the image is compared to the threshold value and is set to a value of zero if below the threshold, or set to a value of one if above the threshold.  This will remove the few small, unwanted edges \(background clutter or small features on the surface of 9 the aircraft aircraft outline In order to avoid aliasing effects from the threshold technique, the image is passed through a filter in Matlab that applies a Gaussian blur to smooth the edges of the aircraft A sample image is shown in Figure 21 Figures 22 and 23 show the results when the image was perturbed using the gradient with threshold technique.  One can see that the plots do not have oscillations that are quite as severe as the standard gradient plots shown in Figures 9 and 10.  However, the oscillations are still present, causing local minima at values significantly different from the nominal position.  Furthermore, in certain degrees of freedom \(such as roll, pitch, and y-axis perturbation minimum value is actually skewed by a few degrees/feet This is again due to small dimension discrepancies at certain attitudes  Figure 21.  Example image after applying magnitude of gradient with threshold.  The threshold on the gradient amplifies the edges of the tanker while removing any unwanted gradient due to background clutter or lens reflection  Figure 22.   Angle perturbation using magnitude of gradient with threshold.  The predicted image is independently perturbed in roll, pitch, and yaw about the nominal position.  The minimum error should occur where the images are best correlated   Figure 23.  Translation perturbation using magnitude of gradient threshold.  The predicted image is independently perturbed in the x, y, and z body axes 


independently perturbed in the x, y, and z body axes about the nominal position.  The minimum error should occur where the images are best correlated An example surface generated from this approach is shown in Figure 24.  This particular surface is not quite as smooth as the sum squared difference plot, but shows a sharper rise away from the nominal position as perturbations are introduced.  This surface also does not possess a distinct 10 minimum at the nominal image location, again causing a potential issue with observability.  Furthermore, examining the mode of x-axis perturbation with simultaneous change in  Figure 24.  Example surface generated using magnitude of gradient with threshold approach by perturbing both the x-axis translation and the amount of roll simultaneously at the pre-contact position The multiple minima near \(0,0 optimal location difficult to detect  Figure 25.  Example surface generated using magnitude of gradient with threshold by perturbing the x-axis translation and amount of pitch simultaneously at the pre-contact position.  Similar to the sum squared difference technique, a  valley   exists that hinders error detection pitch, we see similar results from the sum squared difference technique.  This surface is shown in Figure 25 Finally, examining the magnitude of gradient with threshold while at the contact position, the first mode presented for comparison is the x-axis translation error coupled with roll error.  This surface is shown in Figure 26.  Very similar to Figure 15, there is a very distinct minimum that would easily be detected when near the optimal image location However, when the errors are larger, the undulations in the outer portions of the surface would make error detection difficult.  Furthermore, in Figure 27, the x-axis error couple with pitch error is once again difficult to detect.  Similar to previous plots, the undulations and large  valley  could make the distinct minimum difficult to detect  Figure 26.  Example surface generated using magnitude of gradient with threshold by perturbing the x-axis translation and amount of roll simultaneously at the contact position.  There is a distinct, observable minimum when near the optimal location, but large errors would fall on the unobservable, oscillating outer portion of the surface  Figure 27.  Example surface generated using magnitude of gradient with threshold by perturbing both the x-axis translation and amount of pitch simultaneously at the contact position.  Again observability issues exist due to the oscillations and the  valley  through the surface  11 Analysis Though the magnitude of gradient technique generates a distinct minimum in the surface of Figure 15, its observability is actually poor in many of the other modes shown in Figures 16-18.  Furthermore, if the predicted image shows large errors \(i.e., one or more translation or rotation degrees of freedom are significantly different from those seen in the true image could struggle to identify the actual error.  A short example will help illustrate this point Considering the two surfaces presented in Figures 8 and 15 assume that the system predicts a translation in the x-axis that has an error of 20 ft.  In the case of the sum-squared difference correlation, if one perturbs the predicted value 


difference correlation, if one perturbs the predicted value about this point \(i.e. considers points on the surface in the neighborhood of this prediction between the new images and the truth image, a smaller error will definitely be detected and the system can adjust its prediction closer to matching the true image.  This process can be repeated until the prediction eventually moves in the neighborhood of close correlation \(near the point \(0,0 the graph exist very near the nominal point, however, since this region of the surface is rather flat and thus the error values vary very slowly With the same conditions in the magnitude of gradient approach, small perturbations about this point on the surface will likely yield very similar results to the predicted point In other words, all of the points in the neighborhood of this predicted point will yield similar errors.  Thus, the system will have difficultly not only detecting an error is present but also determining in which degree of freedom the error exists and how to correct it Considering the magnitude of gradient with threshold approach, the surface shows similar behavior to the sum squared difference surface, though the errors appear to increase a little more rapidly than in Figure 8.  Though this attribute would help with error detection, there is still ambiguity around the nominal point, since this portion of the surface contains a few different minima.  The distinct optimal minimum would be difficult to detect With this reasoning, the most robust approach is to use the sum squared differencing technique for coarse error detection, then transition to the magnitude of gradient approach.  The sum squared difference technique also shows the fewest issues with detecting errors across the entire surface.  There are only two modes \(x-axis translation error coupled with pitch error and z-axis translation error coupled with pitch error This is true for the receiver aircraft in both the contact and pre-contact formation positions.  Beginning with the smoother curve will allow the system to more easily observe errors and generate better predictions. Once the error begins to reach the nominal point \(i.e., the error surface begins to flatten gradient approach and fine tune the prediction until the global minimum \(and nominal point Based on the surfaces generated in the three image processing techniques, there is an evident observability issue with pitch.  The sum squared difference and gradient with threshold techniques showed common problems with the pitch and x-translation mode, while the magnitude of gradient had undesirable results with the x-axis translation and pitch mode \(Figure 25 Since the intended approach is to use the sum squared difference as a coarse technique and then transition to gradient, it appears the x-axis translation coupled with pitch and the z-axis translation coupled with pitch will be the major modes to research in detail, particularly in ways to increase visibility to these errors.  Perhaps additional sensors or specific failure modes will be needed to ensure the system has robust performance despite this issue 4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK The above analysis shows the feasibility of rendering an entire image of a lead aircraft as a means to develop an image-aided relative positioning algorithm.  The three proposed predictive rendering and correlation techniques shown have their individual strengths and weaknesses concerning observability of errors, but the combination of sum squared difference and gradient space techniques appears to have the best chance to provide a robust method to accurately predict the best image of the lead aircraft Appendix A contains a block diagram of the overall autonomous aerial refueling flight control system, and 


highlights how the work in this paper will contribute to the larger research effort In the next step of this research, an Unscented Kalman Filter UKF navigation solution.  The UKF will generate sigma points representing the optimal estimate plus various perturbations all of which will be used to generate predictive renderings The filter will weight the sigma points based on the detected errors between the rendered images and the truth images and thus use the images as an update to track the most accurate relative position and translation between the aircraft With a reliable UKF simulated, the final milestone of this research will be to conduct a sensitivity analysis among available sensors to develop the optimal, most robust relative positioning system.   Various grades of inertial sensors and possibly ranging sensors will be analyzed to determine the best performance.  Furthermore, the necessity of a datalink between aircraft will be analyzed to help determine if the relative positioning system can be strictly passive, or must rely on transmitted inertial or position information from the tanker for truly robust operation 12 REFERENCES 1] A.

The distance of the reflected beam from the center of the aperture is then used to calculate I  which varies from about -0.8\260 to +0.8\260 in the experiment Figures 24-28 show the change r I    found by taking the difference of the center of each spectral image and subtracting from its location when I and compared the modeled values over the same range of I Figure 23 illustrates that there is some amount of random error in these measurements, but overa ll the data is grouped around r 0 pixel difference between the measured and modeled values.

The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.  For example, errors in distance to the focal plane or tilt also result in a defocus error which cannot be easily recovered in the reconstruction algorithm R EFERENCES  1  C G r o s s, G  P.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship.
