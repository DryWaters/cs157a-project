This has allowed processing 
to move from simple control and data handling \(C&DH into payloads and other data processing intensive areas Along with this memory cap acities have increased to provide storage for programs and data  In the 1990s architectures to support processing and C&DH systems utilized bussed inte rconnects such as MIL-STD1553B and Peripheral Component Interconnect \(PCI\for most communications between processing elements Though these interfaces have been subject of improvements in speed and bandwidth, needs for data processing have increased at a rate that has overwhelmed the ability of these busses to provide all the desired data interconnects  During the 1990s, medium complexity glue logic surrounding application specific integrated circuits \(ASIC were the dominant form of realiz 
ing electronics in space.  In this decade, fuse-based field programmable gate arrays FPGA\th their radiation hardness and shorter development times, have been utilized much more in creating new space electronics.  Memory-based FPGAs have begun to be used as de velopers around the world work on ways to mitigate radiation effects in order to take advantage of their higher performance and density and make possible spaceborne reconfigurable processing systems  BAE Systems has been at the forefront of processing solutions for space since the late 1980s with the GVSC RAD6000 TM and RAD750 TM processors and their insertion into boards, boxes, payloads and hundreds of spacecraft over the past 15 years.   Utilizing that experience, BAE 
Systems continues to push the envelope for high performance space-based processing systems.  This paper discusses enhancements to the RAD750 family including the recently tested higher speed processor chips, the next generation bridge ASIC, the L2 Cache chip and the results 1  1 978-1-4244-2622-5 09/$25.00\2512009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper#1466 Version 7, Updated 2009:01:10 of these tested improvements in processor system performance.

At the center is the RAD750 and its bridge to the rest of the card.  In blue are the different types of memory that may be connected directly to the bridge.  In purple are the components necessary to supply MIL-STD1553B interfaces, a staple of most systems and in green are I/O interface devices, typical fuse-based FPGA or ASIC devices, the most recent addition being a 4 port SpaceWire ASIC with router originally developed with 14   This general purpose processing architecture is very scalable within a chassis or between chasses depending on data rates to be processed.  One or more cards may be connected via the PCI Bus over a backplane or via the 1553 or SpaceWire interfaces over cables.  Other unique interfaces may be controlled either from PCI, 1553 or SpaceWire resident cards or assemblies.  Multiple processing elements may take a dvantage of this architecture and be configured and loosely coupled into this architecture This architecture requires that the data processing effort be tailored to match the processi ng elements and the interfaces between them or encapsulated in separate units for which this architecture serves as the command and data handling units   This architecture should continue to serve many space applications over the next decad e and beyond.  To that end BAE Systems is developing new processing elements and devices that expand the flexibility and processing capabilities and thus the potential topologies and applications to which these processing elements and support devices may be applied.  These devices also enable new topologies that are more efficient and able to encapsulate and process data where it requires processing and transport it more efficiently between elem ents.  These elements also are continuing a trend to higher capacity as denser technologies are applied to the space processing problems mirroring advances in the ground based commercial sector and realizing savings in size, weight and power 2  200  MH Z RAD750 The RAD750 processor was introduced in 2001 and had its first flight in January 2006 on the Deep Impact Mission The CPU is one of several new products to take advantage of BAE System\222s new 250 nm and 150 nm strategic radiation hardened CMOS foundry upgrade  The 200 MHz RAD750 is a 400 MIPS licensed version of the PowerPC 750 processor running at 1.8v and manufactured in BAE Systems RH15 technology.  In order to achieve the 200 MHz milestone, several changes needed to take place.  The first and largest investment was porting the design from IBM 6SF to BAE Systems RH15 technology.  This required circuit design modifications and new layouts for every aspect of the RAD750.  The second hurdle was integration of new radiation hardened dynamic logic in a radiation hardened form.  The original RAD750 used static logic which was slow but radiation tolerant.  To increase clock speed the re-introduction of dynamic logic was required and implemented in a radiation hardened design.  The final challenge in achieving 200 MHz was the compaction of large custom memory arrays.  In order to shrink the arrays sufficiently, a new memory cell was 


  3 introduced.  This memory cell has a smaller footprint when compared to the original design  A side benefit of the new memory cell was an increase in SEU tolerance.  Leveragi ng off other memory array program 12  t h e 200 M Hz R AD750 uses an opt i m i zed memory cell design that has a smaller footprint and an increase in SEU tolerance When comparing to the previous generation, a 36% reduction in cell area was achieved  The 200MHz RAD750 has been characterized parametrically and verified functionally.   The parts are designed for an operating range of -55 260 C to 125 260 C and will meet full MIL temperature requirements.    Beyond 200 MHz, future generations of the RAD750 will target 250 MHz \(500MIPS 3  N EXT G ENERATION B RIDGE ASIC With higher performance RAD750s becoming available, it was decided to upgrade its companion Power PCI bridge   The Power PCI Golden Gate Bridge ASIC is the next generation single support chip or bridge needed to develop an embedded computer board based on the RAD750 TM processor. It can also be used stand alone without the RAD750 TM processor as a microcontroller for applications such as an intelligent memory card, an intelligent bus interface, or a complex I/O controller  The Power PCI Golden Gate ASIC is a core based design leveraging cores from several design and external intellectual property \(IP usable cores reduce the ASIC development cycle and design cost and improves design quality.[5 Co res reu sed fro m th e p r ev io u s b r id g e ASIC are as follows:  Power PC 60X Bus \(P60X\Static RAM Controller \(SRAMC\aster \(JTAGM\JTAG Slave JTAGS\T, and 32 bit Peripheral Component Interconnect \(PCI-32 modified from the previous Power PCI ASIC design include the Embedded Microcontroller Core \(EMC\emory Access Core DMAC\, Miscellaneous Logic Core \(MISC\, Clock and Test \(CAT\he Advan ced Memory Controller Core AMCC\.

  4 The cores are connected by a 64-bit non-blocking crossbar switch called the On Chip Bus \(OCB\at has been a feature in each of the prior Power PCI ASICs.  The OCB provides a high performance non-blocking internal bus \(6.4 Gbps per lane peak  The EMC i s a 32-bi t program m a bl e R I SC  processor t h at  can be used for monitoring and controlling all the functional cores in the ASIC as well as all the ASIC interfaces and busses.  The EMC may be us ed for SpaceWire Transport Layer support, for ASIC/card initialization, for fault handling and recovery.  A full set of tools including an assembler, C compiler, linker and simulator is provided for the EMC.  The Power PCI Golden Gate EMC was modified to support 18 additional instruc tions including: byte load byte store, load byte shift, store byte shift, register shift instruction, detect number of most significant or least significant zeros, unsigned subtract, shift sign extend, etc  Table 1 compares features and capabilities of the Power PCI Golden Gate ASIC \(block diagram shown in Figure 2\o the previous version of this bridge ASIC, the Enhanced Power PCI ASIC Though i t i s possi bl e for a si ngl e application to fully use all capabilities of either of these devices and thus draw the maximum power shown, there are many options to use subsets of the features and/or run elements at clocks speeds below the rated maximums; this is very application dependent.

  5 4  M EMORY U PGRADES INCLUDING L2  C ACHE  One of the advantages of using the 750 version of the PowerPC is that it includes a built in L2 cache interface with 1 MB addressability.  Another is its ability to provide continuous completion of an average of two instructions per clock cycle when the processor is not instruction or data starved.  Current versions of the RAD750 Space Computer Boards do not utilize the L2 cache and thus many applications larger than an L1 cache are not able to keep the processor supplied with instructions and data and thus drop below the maximum execution rate.  Adding an L2 cache to the next generation RAD750 co mputer systems will enable applications to more fully realize the processing potential of the processor especially as the 200 and 250 MHz versions are utilized  The L2 Cache, like the 200 MHz RAD750, is designed and built in BAE system\222s 150 nm st rategic radiation hardened CMOS foundry.  It is a 4.5 Mbit synchronous SRAM designed to operate at 200 MHz.  When packaged, it is organized as 128K x 72 bits wide composed of two stacked die operating in parallel, each containing 128K x 36.  The x72 data width is used as 64 regular data bits with the extra eight bits used for parity ch ecking.  The L2 cache supports several functional modes including flow through, pipeline and pipeline late write and also has selectable byte write enables  The L2 cache design is an evolution from several generations of SEU hardened memories at BAE Systems Though a new design, the L2 Cache leverages much of its architecture, control circuitry and new memory cell design from space proven memories including the Millennium 4 Mbit SRAM 16 M b i t SR AM 16 and t h e R AD750 internal L1 Cache    Figure 4 - RAD750 Performance versus L1 Miss Rate with and without L2 Cache. \(with high and low speed memories attached when no L2 cache Preliminary performance benchmarking of the 132MHz RAD750 with an L2 Cache memory operating at a reduced 88 MHz showed a substantial performance improvement as the L1 miss rate in the RAD750 increases as shown in Figure 4.  Dhrystone MIPS benchmarks apply especially well to control and data handling processing  The RAD750 has the processing power to also perform signal processing algorithms.  To that end, Fast Fourier Transform \(FFT\benchmarking was performed with the L2 Cache operating at 132 MHz opposite a 132 MHz RAD750 and compared this to a 20 MHz RAD6000, a 33 MHz RAD6000 and a 132 MHz RAD750 without an L2 cache The RAD6000 does not support an L2 cache directly Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the relative performance of the RAD750 on various size FFTs Average throughput increases of 50-100% were observed    Figure 5 - One Dimensional FFT Benchmarks using RAD6000 and RAD750 CPUs 2-Dimensional FFTW Benchmark RAD6000 & RAD750 10.000 10.000 30.000 50.000 70.000 90.000 110.000 130.000 4x4 16x16 64x64 16x512 512x64 256x256 512x512 2Kx2K FFT Size MFLOPS 20 MHz RA D6000 33 MHz RA D6000 132 MHz RAD750 132 MHz RAD750 - 132 MHz L2  Figure 6 - Two Dimensional FFT Benchmarks using RAD6000 and RAD750 CPUs 1-Dimensional FFTW Benchmark RAD6000 & RAD750 0.000 20.000 40.000 60.000 80.000 100.000 120.000 140.000 2.128.8K FFT Size MFLOPS 20 MHz RAD6000 33 MHz RAD6000 132 MHz RAD750 132 MHz RAD750 - 132 MHz L2 RAD750 Performance versus L1 Miss Rate 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 L1 Cache Miss Rate MIPS 132 MHz RAD750/88 MHz L2 Cache 132 MHz RAD750/66 MHz 60x/8 MB SRAM 132 MHz RAD750/66 MHz 60x/40 MB SRAM

The ideal memory would be very dense, radiation hardened, very fast and low power.  Since such a memory has not been realized, a variety of memories are utilized Static Random Access Memory \(SRAM radiation hardened but not as dense as other types.  It can be reasonably fast.  Current processor boards  cont ai n 4 Mbit radiation-hardened SRAMs that are typically stacked in x40 configurations providing x80 words that include 64 data bits and 16 bits that may be used for error correcting codes or spare columns.  BAE Systems, along with other vendors, are working on 16 Mbit Radiation Hardened SRAM devi Fi rst prot ot y p es are expect ed out i n  early 2008 and will likely be stacked in a 2Kx40 or 80 Mbit configurations greatly expanding the amount of hardened memory that may be fit on a typical processing board  The density of Dynamic Random Access Memory \(DRAM typically is one or more orders of magnitude greater than SRAM and is used as the main memory in most personal computers.  Synchronous and various data rate versions are typical.  So far, however, no one has created a radiationhardened version though radiation tolerance can be established through lot testing and error correcting codes within the arrays.  This is typically as fast as SRAM but normally requires a refresh circuit that utilizes some of its access time, making it more difficult to use in systems with real time data needs.  Many of the RAD750 boards have been built with appropriately screened and packaged SDRAMs when SRAM density was not As one starts to apply onboard processing to signal processing applications, memory will be a key bottleneck for buffering and storing results between processing elements.  Efforts to supply a more attractive solution for this type of memory are still years away from being realized so in the meantime testing and packaging of COTS parts will continue to be utilized  Nonvolatile memory is the third type that enables advanced processing and architecture fl exibility.  Most non-volatile memory today utilizes EEPROM devices which require very special handling, are sma ll \(1 Mbit or less per die\are only radiation tolerant and typically have reliability or life limitations.   To provide a truly enabling product, BAE Systems is developing its Chalcogenide-based RAM or CRAM TM  i n si ngl e chi p packages and x32 st acks t oday  and x40 stacks in 2008.  C-RAM operates from a single 3.3v supply, is radiation-hardened and can function as configuration, code, or other storage memory as its read access time is 70 ns.  Write access time is 1 microsecond.  It is especially suited as a companion and configuration storage element for RAM-based FPGAs which are beginning to see use in Signal Processing applications 5  E NABLING FPGA  P ROCESSING  Fuse-based FPGAs are used today to implement many control and data handling n eeds in spacecraft electronics that can\222t use an off the shelf CPU or as miscellaneous logic in support of a CP These devi ces are t y pi cal l y t oo small for signal processing needs within a payload and thus most payloads still rely on ASICs when a space-qualified CPU or DSP cannot provide a cost and Size, Weight and Power \(SWaP\plementation.  Some RAMbased FPGAs, such as devices from the Xilinx Virtex family are starting to be explored and utilized as either ASIC prototypes, ASIC replacements and ultimately as reconfigurable computing \(RCC\ents.[3 1 5   Bein g  able to change function without replacing hardware is especially attractive in space where what is launched is usually all one has to work with  Keeping interfaces to a minimu m will encourage the use of the largest logic arrays within a given SWaP footprint Virtex 4 devices require up to 50 Mbits of configuration memory and Virtex 5 up to 70 Mbits in order to load the configuration of the largest devices.    This will be an important user and driver of non-volatile memory such as C-RAM.  Since these devices are not radiation hardened special mitigation techniques must be applied external to each chip.  These may include scrubbing, readback or other detection and correction methods for handling upsets within    BAE Systems has developed its first version of a Universal FPGA Support Device marrying the support circuitry with  Resource Enabling Device FRED is implemented in an Actel RTAX 2000 and the C-RAM is matched in a four high x32 stack.  This provides several megabits that may be used for storing configuration data FRED uses the same core-based logic and embedded microcontroller \(EMC\n other Power PCI bridge ASICs.  FRED has two configur ation interfaces that may be directly controlled by the EMC or assisted by configuration logic.  Thus FRED is designed to handle any configuration of FPGAs using devices today or tomorrow and able to react and mitigate known FPGA e rrors today or those that are found in the future 


  7  The FRED FPGA, C-RAM and SRAM stacks, a Virtex 2 Pro VP40 and a SpaceWire ASIC have been designed into a Universal FPGA Support Device \(UFSD\ Board to prove out the first version of the UFSD.  Phase 2 currently underway will produce an ASIC version of FRED and combine it with a 5 high C-RAM stack in a single MCM With the UFSD, it will be possible to add RCC processing elements either singly within boards for small amounts of processing or unique interfaces or in large arrays of three to eight FPGAs to perform the signal processing for larger applications 6  A RCHITECTURE T OPOLOGY M IGRATION  The shared bus topology implemented with the PCI interface \(see top box in Figure 8\and now RAD750 processors is especially optimized for command and data handling and other processing when the data rates or number of nodes involved can be contained to a single backplane or chassis or a single board.   This is most typical of the many PCI-based RAD6000 and RAD750 processor solutions sold In t h e com m e rci a l  industry, the use of PCI Bridges \(as shown in the middle part of Figure 8\despread for the past several years.  Our SpaceWire ASIC with its dual PCI interfaces and now our Golden Gate Power PCI ASIC enable such networks to be constructed within a chassis.  With the ever decreasing size of devices, this network may eventually be implemented with mezzanine car ds or single chip devices contained within a single board  The bottom part of Figure 8 shows the other dimension of network topology taking place in the commercial world Whether in ring, mesh or switching architectures, nodes that may contain their own PCI network are being connected together in topologies based on point to point connections The SpaceWire ASIC today follo wed by the Golden Gate Power PCI ASIC are key enablers for implementing these various topologi Each l i nk can run up t o  264 M Hz today and 350 MHz with the Golden Gate ASIC and the links may each be set to a diffe rent speed as required by the device or data transmission requirements.   Comparing a four port SpaceWire ASIC with a 64 bit 33 MHz PCI interface at first appears to tilt in the direction of the PCI in throughput.  However latency a nd bus utilization must be traded off against the guarant eed bandwidth and the almost unlimited ability to expand the point to point networks as missions require  When one looks at the amount of data that must be transmitted between large signal processing nodes \(each possibly made up of several FPGAs or ASICs\the fastest way to move that data today is across LVDS links at speeds up to 600 MHz in Space Environments.  Typically this means many links must used and be kept synchronized to each other just to move data at rates around 264 MBps, the total bandwidth of a 64 bit 33 MHz PCI backplane  Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus BR BR BR BR PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus Device or Memory Device or Memory CPU Or Control CPU Or Control PCI Bus R O U T E R  S W Ring Mesh Switch  Figure 8 - Network Topology Migration  In payloads being planned and designed toady, it is becoming necessary to transmit data at rates higher than 264 MBps.  Parallel synchronous and parallel source synchronous transmission methods are commonly used for transmitting at high data rates across bussed interconnects However, parallel busses require significant board real estate and a large number of connecters.

This has a 200 MHz RAD750 paired with an L2 cache and Golden Gate Bridge running at 100 MHz.   This would sustain 400 MIPS of performance over a wider range of applications than previously possible.

  Picture 6 PCS layout with virtual infrastructure and SAN  The second very important step was the installation and commissioning of a Storage Area Network SAN\, because only a network storage enables to make use of virtualization infrastructure features such as failover. This is due to the fact that virtual machine disk files may not exist on a certain host, as in case of failure it would not be accessible and available any longer to be restarted on a different physical host  SANs are either based on Fibre Channel or iSCSI Technology. The idea of both technologies is to extend the \(usually\nal data lines between hard disk controllers and hard-disks to external devices Fibre Channel has been a proven technology for this type application for years. It has a slightly better performance, but is more expensive than iSCSI iSCSI stands for Internet Small Computer System Interface It  means encapsulation  of the SCSI protocol within TCP/IP packages. Today iSCSI delivers sufficient performance to build up SANs for process automation purposes at a cement works  In such an arrangement, from a failure point of view, the SAN is the most critical peace of hardware in virtualized computer architecture  Although SANs are built up internally fail safe \(redundant power supply, NICs, hard disk controllers,\205 and data sheets give impressive figures for availability, any concept for process control purposes should allow for setting up auto-synchronizing SANs at different spots  User interface VMs running on a host are comparable to applications running on a Terminal Server. In other words, VMs obviously need input and output devices to be handled. Fat clients \(PC\222s\o good choice if it is intended to simplify the maintenance of the process control system hardware. Moreover, they are costly and sometimes prone to error Another step forward -with limited risk only- was to replace some operator stations of a segment by Thin Clients without hard disk The connection between thin client and VM is either done by vendor specific client software, RDP or VNC  Obstacles Minor issues may occur while transferring physical control systems into virtual ones Most of the problems the reference plant encountered had to do with the hardware interfaces such as serial and parallel ports and multi-media features  


Unresolved points \(minor\are to date realizing failover with legacy interfaces and sound output with Windows NT guests   CONCLUSION  Virtualization is no new but a revitalized technol ogy. First virtualization solutions \(purely based on software\ell as computer emulation deliver poor results in terms of performance  Hardware supported virtualization and pure software virtualization are totally different approaches  Virtualization today is most powerful when it combines the strengths of the different technologies. CPU demanding applications are wasting less performance than memory-intense application. \(TLB miss costs  VMware ESX is a good example of this. ESX uses Para-virtualized drivers for the most critical I/O components \(but not for the CPU\, emulation for the le ss important I/O and Binary Translation in order to avoid the high "trap and emulate" performance penalty. In this way, virtualized applications perform quite well, in some cases almost as if th ere were no extra VMM layer involved  The user benefit of virtualization is manifold. Virtualization 225  decouples software from hardware \(provides availability for \223legacy platforms\224, enables software in a cloud 225  utilizes installed hardware more efficient 225  safes space, energy, and invest cost 225  eases system administration extensively  225  but requires additional know-how of system administrators  At this point in time we can say that virtualization has met all of our expectations and offered \226in particular with respect to system administration- even more. The number of plants that started using Virtualization is growing  The process automation staff is still on a learning curve with virtualization in order to take maximum benefit of this technology  Unexploited potential is likely to be found in the field of setting up systems, handling of back-ups and disaster recovery procedures     REFERENCES  200  K.

The distance of the reflected beam from the center of the aperture is then used to calculate I  which varies from about -0.8\260 to +0.8\260 in the experiment Figures 24-28 show the change r I    found by taking the difference of the center of each spectral image and subtracting from its location when I and compared the modeled values over the same range of I Figure 23 illustrates that there is some amount of random error in these measurements, but overa ll the data is grouped around r 0 pixel difference between the measured and modeled values.

The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.  For example, errors in distance to the focal plane or tilt also result in a defocus error which cannot be easily recovered in the reconstruction algorithm R EFERENCES  1  C G r o s s, G  P.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
