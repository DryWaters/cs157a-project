Aiming at the hardware systems and operating 
systems of embedded network terminal, solutions for chat software and e-mail client software based on embedded network terminal were proposed. In this paper, the design of chat software and e-mail client software were described in detail, after analyzing the network socket programming, the email system theory and related protocols. The chat software successfully achieves the communications of embedded network terminals and embedded network terminals, the communication of embedded network terminals and personal computers. The e-mail client software is provided with Greater flexibility and scalability. It not only can send and receive 
messages in both English and Chinese, but also possess of other functions, for example, displaying the mail attachment content without downloading or downloading attachment Keywords-Embedded; Socket; E-mail; chat software; WinCE I   I NTRODUCTION  Embedded systems have been used in transportation commercial / financial, industrial control, medical and many other fields because of these systems can satisfy the special requirements of function, reliability, cost, size, power consumption. At present, the embedded network application 
technology has become a very popular application technology in the international. In order to connect a variety of devices with internet and achieve remote communications and control, Philips, Samsung and other companies are researching corresponding embedded network terminals Follows are hardware options of embedded network terminal based SCM: SCM + Hardware stack + LAN chip; SCM LAN chip. Those modes can’t achieve complex, high-speed communication, because of their software and hardware resources are limited. Aiming at these problems, ARM LAN chip was proposed. Coming with the operating system 
features and arm chip integrating most peripheral circuits this model has fast speed, powerful functions  1 nd can provide a good hardware platform for the realization of internet applications E-mail client system and chat software are popular software for people exchanging information. Currently although there are much such software, which only suitable for PC, but not for embedded network devices which have limited resource, because of those software not only have basic communication functions, but also have many complex features which may occupy a lot of resources. What’s more 
windows CE embedded operating system support few class libraries, for example it doesn’t support “System.Net.Mail and “System.Web.Mail”. So by directly cutting the existing e-mail client systems and chat software, people can’t make them run in embedded operating system. From what the paper has mentioned above, we can see that designing chat software and email client software based on embedded network terminal, have high practical value II  N ETWORK TERMINAL HARDWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEMS  A

Raw sockets are mainly used for testing new protocol implementation stream sockets provide connection-oriented and reliable data transmission services; datagram sockets provide unreliable and connectionless-oriented services B  TCP Connection-oriented Communication Process Using stream sockets programming, the user should have a connection channel before sending data. The communication process is divided into three steps 1  Server Monitoring After being created and launched the Server will monitor on the designated port and wait for client connections 2  Client requests Using stream sockets create a client which is used for sending connection requests to the designated Server. To meet this requirement, the client socket must point out the address and port number of the designated Server before sending connection request   TcpClient tcpClient = new TcpClient tcpClient.Connect\(IPAddress.Parse\(Ser_ip Int32.Parse\(Ser_Port 3  Confirming connection When the server detects a connection request \(listener.Pending \(\ ture\vice process is awakened and generates a new byte stream socket Socket socket = listener.AcceptSocket \(\o connect with the client. The old socket keeps on monitoring service requests on the network C  The design of chat software Both of the software is programmed by stream sockets the server and client of chat software are in the same interface. Follows are the commonly used commands of chat protocol: JOIN, GETLIST, TALK, SECRET, EXIT, OFF Server supports multiple client connections simultaneously whose primary responsibility is to manage client connections and send messages to the client. After landing client system the user can choose friends from the friends list to chat 1  Server’s Desige First of all, creating a server socket by socket TcpListener class: TcpListener listener= new TcpListener\(localaddr_ip, port\. Secondly, making the Server state: listener.Start\(\. When no connection request, the server process is dormant. In order to make multi-user communication come true, the client socket was defined as hashtable object. At the same time, we establish an independent data reception thread for each user to deal with the received data and commands. Creating thread: Thread clientService = new Thread \(new Thread Start client.ServiceClient   Figure 2  Server Design Process 2  Client’s design Using TcpClient class to create a stream socket \(tcpClient\as a client and providing the connected server’s IP address and port number to the function of Connect\(\ by clicking the friend from friends list

The attachment could be voice files, images files and so on D  The design of receiving e-mail Combining the commands of POP3 protocol, Socket and NetworkStream, the client socket can get e-mail source code easily. But how to get the value message from the source code and convert them into the information what people can read are difficult. The e-mail reception system mainly rely on the classes of WincePOPClient, QUOTED-PRINTABLE BASE64, SaveFileAttachment The class of WincePOPClient mainly includes commands of POP3, the way of getting and analyzing mail source code and so on. Combining with the class of QUOTED-PRINTABLE, BASE64, the class of WincePOPClient can display the value information rightly When watching or saving the attachment, the class of WincePOPClient will get the attachment source code from the class of SaveFileAttachment

 interview was conducted, there was not enough information to identify a gestalt. However, the approach taken so far seems to facilitate the implementation of the governance of IT amongst business units  6. Limitations and Contributions  These two pilot cases represent only one first step in a multiple-case study research. It carries however some limitations. First, the units of analysis chosen might not represent pure interorganizational situations. For instance, in the first case, the business relationship between AIRLINER and the other business unit might not represent fully independent organizations. The same observation can be made regarding TAKEOVER where IT governance was studied in a context of the integration of a large manufacturer to a much larger international one The next step could be to select independent businesses using specific business-to-business technology such as an extended value chain supported by an ERP linking an independent supplier to an independent buyer Second, as suggested by De Haes and Van Grembergen \(2006 it w o u l d be appro priate to  interview more than one business representative by organization and to draw information from each IT governance level \(strategic, managerial and operational\This would allow a richer understanding of the business and the interorganizational governance of IT Third, the researchers experienced some difficulties in drawing gestalts due to the high structural and managerial complexities of very large businesses. To alleviate this problem, we need to be more specific in the selection of the business units and the type of interorganizational IT links. A larger sample size is also needed The next phase of this study is to conduct multiple case-studies in order to test the model. We expect to find out patterns reflecting the gestalts of governance and their contribution to successful interorganizational relationships The proposed research framework should help both practitioners and academics to better understand the phenomena of interorganizational governance of IT and how to address each of its specific components This on-going research offers various potential contributions. First, the IT governance of interorganizational relationships has not been very well studied so far. Moreover, the maturity state adds a dynamic approach to the usual and more static investigation on IT governance. This research is among the first to link these emerging modes of interorganizational IT gove rnance to the success of interorganizational relationships. Comparing the emerging modes will allow determining the ones that are likely to best support the multi-partners exchanges, and those that are less successful to do so taking into account the various states in the development of process The two illustrations provided at the beginning and the discussion that followed indicate that a deeper understanding of interorganizational governance of IT is needed. We expect that discovering new modes of interorganizational IT governance will provide guidelines for an efficient and effective use of IT for successful interorganizational relationships  7.

Medium and Low. To determine these levels, the probability for each threat likelihood level is expressed as follows: 1.0 for High, 0.5 for Medium, 0.1 for Low. Regarding the threat impact the following values are assigned: 100 for High, 50 for Medium, and 10 for Low. Now it is possible to multiply the threat probability with the impact values. The risk scale to interpret the results is given below  High \( &gt;50 to 100  Medium \( &gt;10 to 50  Low \(1 to 10 By now we know the individual risk for every threatened asset in case a threat occurs. These asset bound risk levels are required in the subsequent control recommendation step as countermeasures could be required individually for each asset. To gain a single risk level for a threat, the highest risk level over all assets is assigned. In the traditional process it is important to de?ne the meaning of a speci?c risk level and the actions senior management must take. While this is a valuable approach, it is not clear which assets caused the risk level and where to apply countermeasures. AURUM on the contrary offers a more detailed and ?ne grained approach as introduced in the following section  Traceability: The GSTool does not incorporate probabilities for threat occurrences and thus no risk level can be calculated. Instead, the IT Grundschutz Manual approach de?nes lists of relevant threats and required countermeasures according to a typical of?ce environment. By answering control questions a variance analysis between the recommended countermeasures in the IT Grundschutz catalogues and those already implemented can be conducted CRISAM offers neither threat catalogues nor related probabilities. The risk management view in CRISAM displays the variance of the achieved ?nance ratings which are derived by answering the control questions for each resource with the policy de?ned target rating In AURUM the risk is calculated by multiplying the determined impact level with the derived probability for each resource. In contrast to the other tools we present a ?nal risk level to the user which takes the impact and probability into account  Standard Compliant Controls: Regarding control recommendations, the GSTool offers a comprehensive set of threats and corresponding controls, taken from the IT Grundschutz Manual, to mitigate those. For each resource a set of recommended controls is provided. To support the implementation process a responsible person for implementation, a schedule, priority and costs can be stored. For each control question in the CRISAM tool the user can create one or more measures to implement the control. These measures include information on the responsible person for implementation, a schedule, priority and costs. No explicit information on the origin of the control questions is given. Contrasting the other candidates, our solution recommends controls to mitigate vulnerabilities. All controls are derived and explicitly Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 linked to established best-practice guidelines and information security standards. This makes it, e.g., possible to speci?c information security standard as target IX. CONTROL RECOMMENDATIONS Up to this point the overall risk of a threat, or a risk level for each threatened asset, can be calculated. Initially, we sort threats by their risk level, which provides the organization  s decision makers with a thorough overview of current risks In addition, for each threat the organization  s assets at risk and their properties can be queried, which gives the rationals for the calculated risk levels. As mentioned in Section IV also vulnerabilities which render threats possible can be inspected. At this point management knows which risks are not 


spected. At this point management knows which risks are not acceptable for the organization and therefore, measures have to be taken. In this step of the process, controls which could mitigate or eliminate the identi?ed risks, as appropriate to the organization  s operations, should be provided [6]. To support this recommendation step, we consolidate the security model For each vulnerability, appropriate controls are modeled, taken from best practice standards such as the IT Grundschutz Manual. Offering these controls equips the decision makers with effective countermeasures to lower the risk level and thereby protect their business. In contrast to the traditional process, this solution provides a thorough knowledge base about countermeasures and thus 1 that effective solutions are simply forgotten, and 3 effective controls in compliance with best-practice standards While this is already a valuable approach, further improvement can be achieved by a model based test for existing countermeasures and excluding those from the recommendation set Implementation instructions are modeled for each control as axioms, which can be used to test if implementations already exist  Concrete Recommendations: The GSTool provides control recommendations in natural language taken from the IT Grundschutz Manual. These recommendations are mostly highly detailed, but require an expert to draw the appropriate conclusions for the own organization under inspection CRISAM does not incorporate control recommendations users have to de?ne them on their own in accordance to the given control questions. The control questions sometimes include hints for control implementations on a very high level Our solution provides control recommendations to close vulnerabilities for each resource. The controls are given in natural language to enhance understanding and furthermore, as formal implementation descriptions on a conceptual level. The knowledge base also contains concrete implementation instances, which can be automatically recommended. Another advantage is that those controls automatically as control recommendations X. CONTROL EVALUATION AND COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS After identifying all potential controls, they are evaluated and a Cost/Bene?t analysis is carried out. Cost/Bene?t analysis is an integral part of risk evaluation because investments into security must precisely target a company  s speci?c business needs in line with economic demands. Despite the importance of this step, NIST SP 800-30 gives only a shallow overview This step involves the de?nition of the resource- and bene?t categories. The careful speci?cation of these categories is of vital importance as these categories should re?ect the corporate strategy and security policy of the company. The criteria are company speci?c and individually customizable and they can range from monetary quantities \(e.g., minimizing the reduction of monetary loss, monetary costs values \(e.g., user acceptance, implementation hours, loss of reputation cost and bene?t in monetary terms but includes non-?nancial objectives. All potential controls identi?ed in the previous step are rated against the chosen criteria, where the security ontology already provides a selection of objectives \(such as con?dentiality, integrity, and availability controls and their ratings in each category as input, all Paretoef?cient combinations of safeguards are determined \(i.e., there is no other solution with equally good or better values in all K objectives and a strictly better value in at least one objective where the binary variables xi ? {0, 1} indicate whether or not a safeguard i is selected \(xi = 1 if so, and xi = 0 otherwise have to be feasible with respect to two sets of constraints. The rst set relates to limited resources \(e.g., development costs 


rst set relates to limited resources \(e.g., development costs or maintenance costs maximum  or at least a minimum  number of safeguards from given subsets \(e.g., from a certain type of safeguards such as ?rewalls  Effectiveness Rating: The GSTool offers controls taken from the IT Grundschutz Manual. Effectiveness of those controls is not directly given but sometimes information on the effectiveness can be found in natural language in the IT Grundschutz Manual descriptions. Control effectiveness has no in?uence in this approach, only if all controls are implemented the resource is regarded as protected In CRISAM the user manually de?nes controls and connects them to control questions. During the creation process he can also de?ne the expected bene?t in natural language as well as provide numbers for expected savings. Obviously, only an expert has the necessary knowledge to conduct this step but still there is a risk of forgetting necessary controls, wrong connections, unrealistic ?gures, input data errors, etc Focusing on effectiveness, our solution provides effectiveness ratings for all control implementations Those are assigned once by experts in the knowledge base and can be adjusted or extended by users. This approach allows for focusing on highly effective controls Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 rst and provides data for the subsequent cost/bene?t analysis  Granularity: The GSTool does not support cost/bene?t analysis. This step has to be conducted externally. In CRISAM it is possible to manually de?ne ?gures for expected bene?ts and costs for controls. We consider cost/bene?t analysis as an integral part of risk management. As security does not directly generate business value and does not directly improve the net pro?t, investing in security can only prevent negative events or reduce related adverse effects. Traditional cost/bene?t analysis methods do not consider this relation and are ill-suited for the evaluation of security investments, because they fail to properly take into consideration the many important non?nancial criteria. AURUM does not aggregate multiple objectives to a single indicator, but leaves them separated and, furthermore, focuses on the selection of whole portfolios of controls. Thus, it can be guaranteed that all portfolio solutions are not only feasible but also are potentially  good  ones from an objective point of view The ability to consider multiple objectives is of high importance, as an investments adequacy and ef?ciency for a company is determined by different parameters Therefore, the evaluation of a number of objectives must be possible and should be accomplished without a priori weighting of objectives and without breaking them down to a common scale XI. CONTROL SELECTION Decision makers are often overwhelmed with the high number of solution alternatives and are often not aware if their investments into security are appropriate or effective at all. Therefore, AURUM provides an intuitive interface that offers the decision maker information on the speci?c selection problem while the system ensures that the ?nal solution will be an ef?cient one. The decision makers learn about the consequences of their decisions and get information on the gap \(in each category solutions. The decision maker requires support in making a nal determination of the solution that best ?ts his/her notions out of the possibly hundreds \(or even thousands ef?cient alternative portfolios identi?ed in the ?rst phase We are using a search based procedure, which start from an ef?cient portfolio and allows the decision maker to iteratively 


 move  in solution space towards more attractive alternatives until no  better  portfolio can be found. AURUM is based on interactive modi?cations of lower and upper bounds for one or more objectives. To this end, the decision support system \(DSS  ying  bars \(cf. Fig 3 such as costs or availability such as  euro  in the case of costs or  points  in the case of availability For each objective \(cf. Fig. 4 tion on what can be achieved by \(i the dark marks on the left side representing the solution space with all ef?cient portfolios may visually grow together to vertical bars ii the decision maker has made decisions in his/her interactive exploration of the solution space \(this subset from the solution space is represented by the right bar Fig. 3. Status of the DSS at the beginning Fig. 4. Subwindow details Two movable horizontal lines with small arrows at one side represent lower and upper bounds and are intended to restrict the set of remaining solutions in a step-by-step manner \(e.g by raising the minimum bound in one of the objectives for expanding it \(e.g., by once again relaxing some bounds according to the decision makers  preferences. In all of these cases, the system provides immediate feedback about the consequences of such choices in terms of the remaining alternatives. Let us illustrate this by reducing the maximum allowance for resource A \(cf. Fig. 5 Because this setting has primarily ?ltered those solutions that come with a relatively high value in  Resource Category A  and, on average, a somewhat higher need for resource C but still values in  Bene?t Category A  the options in the other objectives have been reduced as well and the position Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 and size of the ?ying bars have changed accordingly. Raising the minimum value for Bene?t A \(e.g., functionality the set of remaining alternatives even further, since many alternatives with low resource values \(e.g., price cf. Fig. 6 Fig. 5. Status of the DSS after the ?rst setting Fig. 6. Status of the DSS after two settings In further iterations, the decision maker continues playing with minimum and maximum bounds and by doing so can learn about the consequences of his/her decisions and, thus gain a much better  feeling  for the problem in terms of what can be achieved in some objectives at what  price  in terms of opportunity costs in other objectives. After several cycles of restricting and once again expanding the opportunity set, the decision maker will ?nally end up with a solution alternative that offers an individually satisfying compromise between the relevant objectives. Note that he does not need to explicitly specify weights for objectives nor to specify the form of his/her preference function or to state how much one solution is better than another during any stage of the whole procedure. Instead, ample information on the speci?c selection problem is provided to him and the system ensures that the nal solution will be an optimal \(i.e., Pareto-ef?cient with no other feasible solution available that is  better  from an objective point of view  Interactive Selection: Whereas the GSTool provides control recommendations in natural language, CRISAM does not incorporate control recommendations. Both tools do not interactively support the decision maker during this phase. We use our knowledge base that contains concrete implementation instances as a basis and provide decision makers with a stepwise and repeatable methodology that gives them plenty of information on the selection problem at hand. This approach provides them with the opportunity to thoroughly explore the set 


them with the opportunity to thoroughly explore the set of Pareto ef?cient solution alternatives until they ?nd the individually most attractive security investment portfolio while the system at the same time guarantees that only feasible Finally, the method allows the decision makers to learn more about the characteristics of the speci?c decision problem and maybe even about their own preferences XII. CONCLUSIONS Companies consider security as one of the most important issues on their agenda, because the increasing number of security breaches poses a major threat to the reliable execution of corporate strategies and may have negative effects on business value. Risk management ensures the consideration of all possible threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the valuable assets. Existing approaches such as best-practice guidelines information security standards, or domain experts but also risk management approaches that are highly accepted within the community come with shortcomings This paper presented a methodology for supporting the entire NIST SP 800-30 risk management process and provides compared to existing solutions the following bene?ts: \(1 ontological information security knowledge base ensures that the information security knowledge is provided in a consistent and comprehensive way to the risk manager, \(2 the organization  s resources within our ontological framework ensures that resources are modeled in a consistent way, \(3 the incorporation of existing best-practice guidelines and information security standards ensures that only widely accepted information security knowledge is used for threat/vulnerability identi?cation and control recommendations, \(4 Bayesian threat likelihood determination ensures that the threat likelihood determination is based on a more objective level compared to existing approaches, \(5 tomatically calculated after resources have been rated initially Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 6 automatically, \(7 decision makers \(e.g., the risk manager scenarios and, thus, to learn about the characteristics of the underlying problem, while the system guarantees that only ef?cient solution can be selected, and \(8 multiple objectives and providing a gap analysis we support decision makers in getting a much better  feeling  for the problem in terms of what can be achieved in some objectives at what  price  in terms of opportunity costs in other objectives We compared AURUM with common risk management tools namely CRISAM and the GSTool, in terms of usability, time exposure for conducting the entire risk management process completeness of the threat/vulnerability identi?cation and the control recommendations, and the granularity of control implementation suggestions XIII.

well as from practitioners, is available, IL strategy including DWH/BI strategy IL strategies are addressed at all, either actual artifacts/documents are proposed without an integrating meta model/methodology, or the strategy making process is described without proposing specific and consistent result templates/structures Since it consumes a significant amount of resources and may constitute significant potentials for business, IL needs strategy. IL strategy must not be limited to hardware/software selection and architectural considerations, but should address the entire business scope of sourcing services, integrating acquired and self-made services into customer-oriented IL solutions, and delivering such solutions to create customer value Our survey of the state of IL strategy in practice reveals that IL sourcing, IL delivery and IL portfolio strategies are regarded as important strategy components. The larger companies are, the more international their focus is, and the more their IL is organized according to the CC model, the more components of a supply-chain oriented explicit IL strategy they are likely to have deployed The IIM model provides a suitable conceptual foundation for structuring such strategy components and also provides best practices from IT management which often can be easily adapted to IL. Regarding IL product/service development and maintenance certain functional oriented strategy sub-components are differentiated in our framework. These strategy components are adapted from an established data management functional framework in order to reflect IL specifics. While traditional, more technically oriented sub-components such as system and data architecture are covered in most companies, business oriented components like change management and project/business requirements management are covered less frequently. Additional research is necessary to develop appropriate solution components based on existing fragments and experiences Based on a more complete comprehension of IL strategy and its components, the strategy development and update process needs to be addressed in future research as well. Instead of developing and updating business strategies, IT strategies and IL strategies in independent processes, dependencies and cycles need to be addressed. A comprehensive understanding of IL strategy and respective processes may also serve as a foundation for establishing maturity models, reference models and best practices  References 1] Arnott, D. and G.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
