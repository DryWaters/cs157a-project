Unveiling Secrets of Successful Chinese Software Companies Yuanxun Gu School of Economics and Management Beijing Jiaotong University Beijing, China guyuanxun@bjtu.edu.cn Yajiong Xue College of Business  East Carolina University Greenville, NC, USA xuy@ecu.edu Zhongdong Xiao School of Management Xiêan Jiaotong University Xiêan, China xzd@bjtu.edu.cn Abstract There are secrets and business of successful software companies explained by Hoch in 2000 and Cusumano in 2004, but there existed none cases from China. This occurred maybe the Chinese software companies are in infancy and the survey is challenge in China. However, the software industry plays an important role in innovation and pushing the economical transformation in China economics. So, in this work, we first archived and abstracted the success experiences from the international software companies. Next to setup a criteria to define the successful Chinese software companies \(SCSCs China and got the materials and data through the telephone survey, interviewing, searching the professional magazines and reviewing the documents of some companies. More, to pigeonholing the data and finding the characteristics that led to success and comparing the characteristics with the international ones. The results showed that SCSCs verified the international characteristics, and displayed so me special characteristics that distinguished the SCSC with the international ones. The special characteristics listed as follows. First, the entrepreneurs own the power to find the market space and could provide the high aptness, compact function and high quality product. Second SCSCs owned the  intellectual property rights independently of product, product-type company not service-type company gradually developed into SCSCs. Third the SCSCs usually originated from the middle and low range market, this is representative road that produced SCSCs. Fourth, the founder acts as the leader of the company unremittingly up to now, and control the strategy that decided the fate on the crisis of transformation which make the company stride forward to the Ruritania of the founders. Fifth, make the business on the robust status that to avoid the big variation. Sixth, the core business is prominent and professional Keywords software company in China, Success Characteristic, Special Characteristic, Product, Service I I NTRODUCTION As the worldês software market becomes increasingly globalized and the trend of IT outsourcing continues to strengthen, China is expected to play a key role in the global software arena and deserves close attention [1  A si gni fi ca nt  contributor to Chinaês sustaining economic growth, Chinaês domestic software market is gigantic. Its total value in 2007 was 52.7 billion dollars, accounting for 8.7% of the global software market [2   W ith Ch in a s g r o w in g o u tso u r c i n g  services and domestic demand, the expected compound annual growth rate for her software market is 16.2% from 2008 to 2 Ac cord i ng to t h e cr i t er i a  o f  t op 5 00 s o ft wa re company published by Software Magazine 1 m a ny C h ines e  companies beat the criteria and could have been ranked However, unlike India which mainly provides IT outsourcing services to foreign countries, Chinaês computer industry is primarily focused on serving domestic demands in recent years 1   T h u s  lit tle is k n o w n ab ou t w h at led t o th e su ccess  of  Chinese software companies, although such knowledge would be beneficial to those who are interested in Chinaês software market. Hoc  a nd Cusu m a no 4 ha v e i nve s t i g at ed successful international software companiesê characteristics related to business strategies, critical decision making, and core business functions. Yet, their research does not include Chinese companies. Few prior studies have examined the characteristics of successful Chinese software companies \(SCSCs\-vis those of international companies. Do SCSCs and their international peers share common characteristics? Given Chinaês unique cultural and business contexts, we suspect that the answer is yes. In this article we will lead you to enter the dragon by unveiling the secrets of SCSCs II S ELECTING S UCCESSFUL C OMPANIES This study is focused on independent software vendors ISVs\. Drawing from and extending Hoch et alês [6 cr ite ri a  for software company success, we determine whether a company is a SCSC by evaluating eleven dimensions including business areas and product lines, ranking in the segment market, company age, accreditation systems, revenues of the past three years, profit of the past three years, number of employees, number of channels and their coverage, primary business design and transformation, partnership network marketing strategy and performance. We conducted a focus group consisting of software company senior managers and industry experts to assess the legitimacy and comprehensiveness of these dimensions. To select SCSCs, we first developed a list of candidate companies based governmental data provided by MIIT \(Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China  a nd co mm e r c i al  re se ar ch  reports published by IDC [7 a n d CCI D N ET 2 T h e candidates included the top three companies in each segment of Chinaês software market. They were analyzed and compared from the eleven dimensions we identified and a focus group Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics San Antonio, TX, USA - October 2009 978-1-4244-2794-9/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE 3629 
 


consisting of industry experts was conducted to help us determine the most successful companies. Finally, ten companies were identified as SCSCs for this study Ö the top three mass market product \(including security software companies \(KINGSOFT, RISINGSOFT, and JIANGMIN four enterprise solution product companies \(top two ERP providers Ö UFIDA and KINGDEE and top two PLM software providers Ö EXTECH and KMSOFT\ the top two professional service companies \(NEUSOFT and China Software Service and the top one middleware company \(TONGTECH\. Table 1 shows some general information of the ten companies TABLE I T HE TEN SUCCESSFUL C HINESE SOFTWARE COMPANIES Company Name Foun ding Year Core Business  UFIDA 1988 Business Software Kingdee 1993 Business Software Neusoft 1991 I ndustry solutions & outsourcing China Software service 1980 I ndustry solutions & outsourcing TongTech 1992 Middleware Kingsoft 1989 Office and Security  RisingSoft 1991 Security Jiangmin 1996 Security Extech 1994 Product Lifecycle Management sofeware KMSoft 1996 Product Lifecycle Management sofeware III C HARACTERISTICS S HARED BY C HINESE AND I NTERNATIONAL S UCCESSFUL S OFTWARE C OMPANIES Based on the findings of Hoch [6 n d Cunsu m a no 3  4   w e dev el o p e d a s e t  of c o m m on ch a rac te ris t ics of  international successful software companies and used it to evaluate the ten SCSCs. The results demonstrate that the SCSCs possess most of the important characteristics of their international peers. Their commonality can be highlighted in the following four areas A Stable Leadership and Continuous Innovation Like international successful software companies, SCSCs typically have leaders who have a long tenure and are able to innovate continuously to expand the companies. The CEO of UIFDA has been in his position since the company was founded in 1988. Under his leadership, the annual revenue of UIFDA grew from about 8,000 US dollars in 1988 to 180 million US dollars in 2007, its sales dollar amount of 2007 was as much as 20,000 times of that of 1988, and its number of employees has increased from two in 1988 to over 6,000 UIFDAês product provision has evolved from finance packages to total enterprise solutions consisting of three steady product lines designed for mini, small and medium, and large enterprises. UIFDA has the largest share in Chinaês finance software and ERP markets. It has developed the first ERP on the JAVA platform in the world and will release the ERP based on an independent SOA platform in 2008. Following a path similar to UIFDAês, KINGDEE started as a finance software provider and became the second largest provider of enterprise solutions through continuous product innovations. The president and CEO of KINGSOFT have been the twin leaders since 1992 until the CEO retired in 2008 and the president took over his position. Now, KINGSOFT is the first provider of Chinese office suite and electronic-dictionary, and one of the top three providers of security software. The CEO of TONGTECH has not changed since 1992. He led the revolutionary and strategic reform that transformed TONGTECH from a system integrator company to a middleware ISV. TONGTECH started a software factory plan in May 1999, whose objective is to build structured software development and management systems to improve quality and efficiency of software development and enhance the companyês competitiveness. TONGTECH is the first provider of middleware of China, and one of the top three providers in Chinaês middleware market, with the other two being IBM and BEA. The CEO of NEUSOFT has also held his position since the company was founded in 1991. NEUSOFT is the biggest outsourcing provider in China. It is the first Chinese company which developed CT \(Computerized Tomography\ machine with independent intellectual property in 1994. At present NEUSOFT is capable of providing total digital imaging solutions to hospitals. The CEO of EXTECH has been on the post since the company was founded in 1994 and witnessed the companyês development from a start-up to the bellwether of Chinaês PLM market B Strong R&D Team and Rigorous Testing The SCSCs we studied have the strongest R&D teams in their segment industries and obtained the CMM/CMMI level 5 certification to guarantee their product quality. They actively took part in the 863 program supported by the Chinese government to encourage technological development and innovations, thereby enhancing their own R&D capabilities UFIDA has about 800 R&D employees and KINGDEE has about 500. More than 700 employees at KINGSOFTês are doing R&D work. UIFDA, KINGDEE, and NEUSOFT have received the CMM/CMMI5 accreditation. UFIDA also established a national level enterprise technology R&D center and joint labs with Microsoft and INTEL to facilitate collaboration. The SCSCs emphasize product quality. In UIFDA, the daily build routine has been carried out since 2002 Testing is a task of great importance in UIFDA. On average every two development engineers are supported by a specialized test engineer. In addition, UIFDA frequently hire professional testing companies and conduct testing participated by all of its own employees and client companiesê employees When KINGSOFT released an alpha version of its anti-virus product in April 1999, it performed a large-scale testing that involved about two million participants who could download the software through over 200 websites including SINA.com and SOHU.com or install the soft ware from CDs bundled with newspapers and magazines of more than 10 media companies such as China Information World and Computer World. The testing lasted 18 months until the softwareês market launch in November 2001. Additionally, KINGSOFT provide free specialized antivirus tools for specific viruses  C Emphasis on Marketing  Successful software companies usually have experiences of marketing success, and their marketing strategies are considered çbest practicesé in their segment markets. They always take advantage of various media to demonstrate their new products and solutions and introduce successful customers so that their visibility and reputation are increased. UFIDA and 3630 
 


KINGDEE hold a grand customer forum each year respectively. It is their most important marketing campaign of the business year and they invest millions of RMB yuan in the event. UFIDA also hosts an annual manufacturer summit which invites research experts, successful customers, R&D experts partners, and government officers to communicate on issues regarding management optimization and solution design in manufacturing firms. In addition, UFIDA holds over 300 small-scale symposiums on special topics that aimed at niche market requirements, and dozens of service symposiums UFIDAês customers will receive a company periodical which distributes news of UFIDA products and service, success stories, and management best practices. In 2002 KINGDEE established the Oriental Pearl Club Ö a customer club intending to strengthen their ties with customers. About 60,000 companies around the country joined this club. The club holds a customer success experience sharing event almost every two days. KINGDEE puts all the customer success stories together and publishes a yearly book reposting those cases. KINGSOFT established its leadership in the electronic dictionary market by launching the çRed Storm of Genuineé marketing strategy in 1999, and released a free personal version of the GOOGLE-KINGSOFT electronic dictionary in 2008 to enhance customer loyalty. Through marketing campaigns such as çBlue Security Revolutioné and ç10,000-mile March Anti-virus Campaigné KINGSOFT volunteered to remove computer viruses for free in every region of China and raised security awareness among computer users. KINGSOFT hosted a press conference in 2003 to announce its signing a contract to provide WPS office software to more than 2,000 middle schools in Shanghai, which greatly increased its visibility. In the office software market dominated by Microsoft KINGSOFT was able to hold its ground and became the leader of the office software market in China  D Network of Partners Similar to international successful software companies SCSCs all have a large, effective, multi-layer partnership network. UFIDA is one of the 12 ISV global partners of Microsoft. This partnership allows UFIDA to stay current with Microsoftês technological advancement. Both UIFDA and KINGDEE established a long-term collaborative relationship with IBM in R&D. The relationship between KINGDEE and IBM allows them to jointly de sign business solutions. UFIDA and KINGDEE also have partners for secondary development and local customization. UFIDA connects with a wide range of partners providing complementary solutions such as PLM solutions, bar code systems, instant messaging software, mobile and PDA appliances, VPN solutions, online banking solutions and specific industry solutions, forming an ecosystem of integrated enterprise solutions. In sales and service, UIFDA and KINGDEE have hundreds of agents all over the country These agents have various certifications and sell different products based on their qualifications. Both UFIDA and KINGDEE also have dozens of partner service companies specialized in implementing UFIDA and KINGDEE products TONGTECH developed a partner network composed of qualified partners, value adding partners and strategic partners KINGSOFT created a partner network including sales partners value-adding partners, technology partners and network marketing partners. NEUSOFT and China Software & Service cooperate with well-known companies such as Microsoft, IBM ORACLE, BEA, CISCO, SUN, and FUJITSU IV U NIQUE C HARACTERISTICS OF S UCCESSFUL C HINESE S OFTWARE C OMPANY Given Chinaês unique context, it is reasonable to contend that a company that has all the characteristics of international successful software companies might not succeed in China Just like socialism in China should be çsocialism with Chinese characteristicsé, software companies need to possess some Chinese characteristicsé to be successful in Chinaês software market. To reveal the unique characteristics of SCSCs, we followed the case study research methodology to collect and analyze data First, in the interviews we showed company executives a list of characteristics of successful international software companies identified by Hoch et al. [6 d  C u s u m a n o   3 4 5   and asked them to name characteristics of SCSCs that were not listed. Second, we conducted a focus group consisting of six academic researchers and senior managers from software companies to validate the unique characteristics of SCSCs. The characteristics were then confirmed by reviewing the opinions of the SCSCsê CEOs regarding business strategies and operations published in various periodicals. Finally, we performed a systematic analysis of all the materials collected during the study, resolved contradicting views via debating and collecting additional information, and finalized six unique characteristics of SCSCs. These characteristics are discussed as follows A Find and Fit Niches SCSCs have capabilities of finding market niches in China and providing efficient products to meet specific demands of the niche market. UFIDA is one of the first providers of finance management software. The two founders of UFIDA developed a finance management product in 1988 based on Dbase III running on individual PCs. This occurred when computers started to be used to support management in China and the software provided special accounting functions to help accountants. The primary objective of UFIDAês early products is to improve accounting efficiency, thus librating accountants from burdensome and repetitive manual accounting work. UFIDA established a large customer base through selling its finance management software, which laid the foundation for its future dominance in the enterprise system market. KINGDEEês growth is similar to UFIDAês KINGSOFTês early product was Word Processing System WPS\veloped by its founder, Qiu Bojun, in 1988. Written in assembly language, WPS was able to process Chinese character input and typesetting. Relying on word of mouth to diffuse, WPS was the most popular software \(its highest market share reached 90% at one time\ in China in the early 1990s WPS was even a required course in curriculums for computer science majors in Chinese universities. WPS dominates the Chinese word processing market and KINGSOFT becomes well-known because of WPS. Recognizing the trend of computer networking and the need of integrating multi-platform systems, TONGTECH positioned itself as a middleware manufacturer. Now it is the market leader in Chinaês middleware market 3631 
 


B Products Outperform Services SCSCs usually evolved from product companies that own intellectual property rights rather than service companies All of the ten SCSCs started as product companies. UIFDA and KINGDEE started from finance management software products, KINGSOFT from office software products TONGTECH from middleware products, and EXTECH and KMSOFT from PLM software products. NEUSOFT and China SOFTWARE & SERVICE provide both services and products Yet, these two companiesê business is primarily focused on software products  C Start Low The typical road to success for SCSCs started from winning the middle or low end market. UFIDAês and KINGDEEês early finance management software was designed for small and medium enterprises. Even after they expanded to the ERP market, their ERP products were oriented toward SMEs. In contrast, international ERP vendors such as SAP are focused on the high end market from the right beginning. Two Chinese companies, CASE SOFTWARE and RIMABSOFTWARE, tried to provide enterprise solutions to the high end market, but both failed. KINGSOFT at first entered the low end personal software market. It then expanded into the high end market to serve governments and large enterprises after it improved product quality and achieved reputation from its experiences in the low end market RISINGSOFTês and JIANGMINês anti-virus software products also started from the low end personal market and later expanded into the high end market  D Founder Also Leader The founders of the SCSCs have kept their leadership continuously and oversaw the critical strategic transformations which ensured the companies to march toward their long-term goal without interruptions. The founders of UFIDA KINGDEE, KINGSOFT, NEUSOFT, TONGTECH, EXTECH and JIANGMIN have been leading the companies since the companiesê birth. They never lost control over their companies by equity transfer. Their faith, ambition and vision are driving forces of the companiesê growth and innovation. UFIDAês goal is to become one of top 50 software providers of the world by 2010 and now it is the largest ISV of enterprise systems in Asia. KINGDEEês goal is to be the leading provider of enterprise systems in Asia by 2010. KINGSOFTês dream is that every computer in the world runs KINGSOFT software E Stable Operations The SCSCs maintained stable and robust business operations and avoided large fluctuations. UFIDA, KINGDEE NEUSOFT, China Software & Service, RISINGSOFT JIANGMIN, EXTECH, and TONGTECH never encountered a financial crisis. Their stable operations helped to retain core personnel and create virtuous cycles of human resource development, which contributed to the companiesê success F Focus on One Core Business  The SCSCs always focus on one core business, and achieve leadership in the segment market. No matter what their core business is, be it enterprise solution, anti-virus or middleware, they make this focus distinctly clear and never waste resources on non-core businesses. Thus, the SCSCs do not have broad product lines as MICROSOFT, ORACLE, and IBM have  They are more similar to SAP that specialized in a specific area In summary, the unique characteristics of SCSCs are related to the history of Chinaês software industry, national economic development, and experiences and innovativeness of entrepreneurs V D ISCUSSION As our analysis reveals, SCSCs not only imitate international successful software companies in many ways, but also have their own unique characteristics. The basic path to success for Chinese software companies is to rely on a high quality product that fits the Chinese market to establish a broad customer base at first and then gradually upgrade the product and add new product lines, thus realizing the breakthrough from middle and low end markets to the high end market  Strategic decision making proves to be critical for SCSCs to approach success. For example, since its early days UFIDA believed that finance management should be productized While many peer companies proposed that each finance management project should be a customization, UFIDA stuck to its belief and grew from a two-person start-up to the largest enterprise solution provider in Asia which hires more than 6000 employees. UFIDA has made critical decisions on product development. From 1997 to 2001 UFIDA spent 30 million U.S dollars to develop Java-based ERP-NC for the high end ERP market, which enabled it to compete with SAP and ORACLE in Chinaês high-end market of enterprise systems KINGDEEês decision to develop Chinaês first finance management software based on the Windows platform when DOS-based finance software was still popular helped the company achieve considerable competitive advantage KINGDEE seized a large market share after releasing its advanced finance management software in 1992. TONGTECH strategically decided to transform from a system integrator to a middleware provider in 1992. To date, it is the No. one brand in Chinaês middleware market and holds 30% of the market share. TONGTECH made another strategic decision in 2007 to move from a direct sales model to a distribution model, which is expected to boost its revenues remarkably. KINGSOFT was devoted to the WPS office software in the past two decades and made huge investments on product development. Its two significant investments on WPS optimization are noteworthy First, Qiu Bojun sold his villa in 1996 for a quarter of a million dollars to develop WPS97 based on Windows. Second KINSOFT spent five million dollars to develop WPS2005 in 2002. The professional version WPS is small \(23MB compatible with a wide range of file formats. While it can realize all the functions of Microsoft office suite, its price is only a quarter of Microsoft office suiteês price. It is known as the first brand of office software in China and beat Microsoft office many times in group purchases due to its high performance-to-price ratio SCSCs also have deficiencies in terms of international market exploration, platform dependency and selection, and low price. First, SCSCs are hardly seen in the international software market. A few exceptions include NEUSOFT and 3632 
 


CSS which provide outsourcing services to foreign clients KINGSOFT which has sales offices and provides security software in Japan and Vietnam, and UFIDA which has sporadic international clients. As indicated in Aspray et al [1 s  report, Chinaês software companies mainly provide outsourcing services to Japanese software companies. The majority of NEUSOFTês 83 million US dollars outsourcing service income are from the Japanese market. Overall, SCSCs generate very limited revenues from the international market.  Second Chinese software companies have been enslaved to infrastructural technologies such as operation systems, database systems, development tools, and web browsers. They lack control over these technologies, so their product design will likely be constrained by the technology providers. Third, the price of domestic software is relatively low in China. This might be due to Chinaês traditional value systems that emphasize tangible wealth but underestimate intangible wealth such as information, knowledge, and software  However, the providers of business software are bigger than others in the revenue and play more important role in influencing the China software industry. Based on the results of Olson & Zhao [9 an d So ja  1 1  th e f u tu r e s t ep is t o ex pl or e  the secrets of business software ISVs of China from the detailed products and multi-project implementations In conclusion, the SCSCs we studied suggest that if a software company wants to achieve success in China it must understand the Chinese context and develop products that fit Chinese companiesê scale, demand, and level of software application A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by grants from the Ph.D Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No 200800041031\, Beijing Natural Science Foundation No.9092011\ Beijing Jiaotong University Key Project No.BJTU2006XZ009\nd Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University \(No.NCET-07-0681\ of Ministry of Education of China, all the supports empower the research motivation R EFERENCES 1 A s p r a y  W  May adas F  V a r d i M Y  G l o b al iz atio n an d o f f s ho r i ng o f  software: A report of the ACM job migration task force.

  6 where the notation is used to indicate the measurement in the bearing cell corresponding to The likelihood of the two-node measurement set   conditioned on the target present hypothesis \(the numerator of the likelihood ratio\mply the product of the two target present probabilities since target presence is more likely when the data follows the target present distribution in both sensors. In contrast, the target absent hypothesis is the composite hypothesis that either \(a\th measurements are drawn from the target absent density or \(b\measurement is drawn from the target present hypothesis and one from the target absent hypothesis. Therefore, in following with the GLRT, the denominator of the likelihood ratio is computed as the maximum over the three atomic hypotheses from both sensors from sensor 1 and from sensor 2, and from sensor 1 and from sensor 2 4  S INGLE T ARGET D ETECTION AND T RACKING I MPLEMENTATION  This section describes how the mathematics of Section 3 is implemented. The approach we take here utilizes a discrete grid representation of the posterior. In contrast, other work 5 a s em p l oyed a p a rticle ap prox im atio n to th e relevan t  posteriors. As discussed earlier there are tradeoffs involved in the two approaches Representation of target state probability We represent the target state probability on a 4D discrete grid \(corresponding to the four dimensional state vector     cells. The spatial extent of this grid dictates the overall region where targets may be detected. The cell resolution must be carefully chosen based on the sensors and geometry to allow sufficient accuracy. Figure 3 gi ves an example of marginal PDFs as represented on a discrete grid The tradeoffs involved in grid resolution include the following: \(i\rithm speed is roughly linear in the number of grid cells. The number of the grid cells is the product of cells in each of the spatial and each of the velocity dimensions. This fact rewards minimizing of the number of cells either by limiting the overall region upon which the PDF is approximated or making the discretization coarse. \(ii\Single-target tr acking performance degrades as the grid cells become coarser In particular, since the sensor to target state mapping is nonlinear, performance breaks down substantially above certain cell resolution sizes depending on the sensor geometry\Both of these phenomena will be illustrated later Temporal update of the tracking probability The temporal evolution of the probability density on can be expressed in continuous time using a partial differential equation. We wish to compute    from    The relation between these two densities can be expressed as                Using \(i\econd order Taylor series approximation to     ii\ming the 223nearly constant velocity\224 model for the transition density    and \(iii\g small we find the Fokker-Planck equation  This derivation is given in more detail in the Appendix  Figure 3\226 Grid-based represent ation of the target state density. Left: Th e 4D posterior margin alized to give the probability density. Right: The marginal 


  7 In the following discussion we use this transition model Other models can be incorporated similarly, including models which use roadway constraints and higher order motion terms In the experiments we discuss later, this model is valid \(i.e the diffusivity of the target is captured statistically by the diffusivity coefficient in the model\es where robust modeling of the target dynamics is not possible, one typically appeals to a multiple model approach [13 wh i c h adds robustness to the filtering by allowing it to select from a number of candidate motion models The state probability density is represented on a discrete grid and so this differential equation must be used to update that representation. This discrete update is computed from time to time  using a backward Euler method as              13 This approach has nice stability properties in both and For more details, see [1  This is illustrated graphically in Figure 4, where the left hand side represents the posterior from the k th time step and the right hand side represents the prediction for the k+1 th  time step. The white dot represents the true target position In this example, the target is moving in the positive x  direction, causing the probability mass to evolve preferentially along the positive x direction This computation method is linear in the number of grid cells used in the discretizatio n. Linear dependence on grid cell number is achieved using the backward Euler method above, yielding a tridiagonal system of equations which is efficiently solved using Thom as\222 algorithm Fi gu r e 5  illustrates this dependency from empirical tests  Figure 5\226 Computation is linear in number of grid cells Temporal update of the target present probability The target present and absent probabilities are updated according to the simple mixing model described in eq. \(8 corresponding physically to targets arriving and leaving at a constant rate. Since this is a discrete PMF with only two possible events \(target present and target absent implemented by simply storing a single floating point number corresponding to the target present probability Measurement update of the tracking probability As discussed above, evaluating the measurement likelihood for each cell performs the target state probability update   14 This simply requires computation of the likelihood ratio at each cell Specializing again to the two-node, bearings only situation, at each time step each sensor node makes measurements at all \(discretized bearings \(beams he sensor model describes statistically the likelihood of each measurem ent conditioned on target  Figure 4\226 The temporal update of th e target state probability density 


  8 present, as illustrated in Figure 6. Note that different node locations yield different beam widths and spatial information By assumption, the joint likelihood of the measurements conditioned on target present \(the numerator\he product of the two individual likelihoods \(i.e., the noise is independent from sensor to sensor  15 where from the end of Section 3 we know   16 Here is the bearing cell \(beam\ into which projects at sensor node 1. Therefore, for each grid cell in the discrete representation of we compute the hypothesis probability as proportional to    17 As mentioned above, the hypothesis \(the denominator of the likelihood ratio\rresponds to the composite hypothesis that either \(i\neither sensor has target energy in the target bearing, or \(ii\ one of the two sensors \(but not both\has energy in the target bearing. Therefore, the probability of the hypothesis is evaluated by appealing to the GLRT as          18 Finally, the measurement update for cell is computed as           19 Measurement update of the target present probability As discussed in Section 3, the measurement update of the target present probability is performed as    20 By comparison, it is seen that the inner term in this integral is the measurement update done on the target state probability density \(eq. \(14\\erefore, the update of the target present and absent probabilities simply requires summing the \(non-normalized\et state probability after the measurement update is performed, followed by a normalization step which forces  For computational purposes, it is desirable that the target state grid contain the fewest number of cells that allow robust estimation. Cells which contain zero probability mass are useless computation and should be avoided. However since we are tracking moving ta rgets, the locations of the grid cells needed to estimate the target state density change over time. Therefore, we use a moving grid, which constantly re-centers around the estimated state of the target every update. In practice, we onl y allow the grid to translate a small number of cells at each time step, which minimizes the chance that a small number of bad measurements can shift the target off the grid  Figure 6\226 Single Sensor conditional likelihoods 


  9 On Grid Resolution As mentioned to earlier, the resolution \(spacing\of the target detection and tracking spatial grid cells is of critical importance. In our method, we choose to allow each cell center to represent the entire cell. An alternative approach would treat each cell as containing many sub-cells and requiring a weighted update. This has a similar computational burden as making the grid cell finer, and provides a benefit in the single target tracking case However, in the multitarget tracking case discussed later it introduces other problems. A discussion of these problems is deferred until later In the single target tracking case where cell centers represent the cell, the main c oncern is to ensure the cell spacing is fine enough. Th is avoids cases where the conditional likelihood has energy in large parts of a cell but does not overlap with the cell center. Figure 7 illustrates this. In this figure, cell boundaries are indicated by white lines, and cell centers by black dots. The true target location is given by the green dot. The conditional probability density is indicated by the color scale showing the intersection of the two sensor node beams. Because the grid resolution is insufficient, the cell center in the cell the target actually occupies does not corr espond to the peak of the conditional as it should. This mismatch leads to the target containing cell incorrectly r eceiving low likelihood in the measurement update  Figure 7 - Grid cells must be spaced finely enough to avoid degenerate cases where no cell center corresponds to the peak of the likelihood function The remedy for this issue is to make the cells more finely spaced. Also note that unless the grid cells are spaced grossly inadequately \(as they are in the example given Figure 11 later\is problem does typically does not persist from time step to time step as the target is moving. The most catastrophic consequence of poor grid cell resolution is track fragmentation. In the case of overly coarse cell discretization, the track existence probability will be artificially driven lower resu lting in \(incorrectly\moving the track. A new track would then be instituted very shortly On Computational Requirements The dominant properties that e ffect computations are \(i number of grid cells and \(ii\he number of targets. Section 5 discusses algorithm scaling with the number of targets. Here we focus on the single target case and note that the algorithm scales linearly with number of grid cells \(which is the product      Figure 8 illustrates empirically the tradeoff between cell resolution, tracking, and algorithm run time in the single target detection and tracking case. As the grid cell resolution decreases \(i.e., the number of cells used to represent the probability density increase\e tracking error decreases. It reaches an asymptote which is dictated by the sensor resolution. Furthermore, as the grid cell resolution decreases i.e., the number of grid cells increases\the computation time increases   Figure 8 \226 For single target tracking, performance improves as grid cells become more finely spaced. This is at the cost of increased computation time A second way to deal with th e degeneracy caused by large grid cells is to compute the cell likelihood function by weighting the likelihood of the beams into which the cell projects. In other words, inst ead of using the cell center to represent the entire cell, treat the cell as the continuum of points it represents.  Doing this exactly is computationally prohibitive, but approximate methods such as averaging discrete points in a cell are feasible. This is a net computation savings over simply making the grid cells smaller because it avoids increasing the number of cells that require temporal update In the multitarget case, the problem is more complicated Since many cells will correspond to the peak of the conditional likelihood, blindly shrinking cell size or interpolating the conditional will lead to false \(double initializations of targets. We will discuss this further in Sections 6 and 7 


  10 5  M ULTITARGET D ETECTION AND T RACKING T HEORY  In principle, multiple target detection and tracking requires estimation of the joint multitarget probability density   21 where denotes the number of targets present at time k   and  are the individual states of those targets The state space of this joint multitarget probability density grows exponentially with the number of targets and hence precise computation grows ex ponentially as well. Bruteforce multitarget discrete grid representations of this high dimensional posterior become intractable with more than two or three targets in a fo ur dimensional state space Fortunately, high fidelity modeling of the joint coupling is only necessary when targets are close together, i.e., widely spaced targets can be treated nearly optimally by solving multiple single target detection and tracking problems. In the \(unrealistic\g case, where all targets are well separated in measurement space numerical estimation of the joint density grows linearly with the number of targets rather than exponentially A more sophisticated approach to this problem is to automatically factorize the joint density into small groups of targets which must be treated jointly and develop a computational solution which is a compromise between the exponential growth of the joint computation and the linear growth of the fully factored computation. A detailed discussion of a joint density adaptive factorization approach and the precise algorithmic details in a related environment are discussed at length in [5  and  6    In our present implementation, we have chosen to simply treat the multiple target situation as a collection of single target detection and tracking problems. To account for the sub-optimality of this approach when targets are nearby in measurement space, we employ a data-censoring algorithm which operates when targets are close - i.e., we make the approximation    22 and censor some of the data fr om nearby trackers to prevent improper evaluation of the conditional likelihood Future work will extend this to high fidelity sensor modeling and joint density calculation for closely spaced targets when necessary. A sk etch of this extension analogous to the approach in [5 ws. Fi rst, th e target state and relevant uncertainty will be estimated for each target. Then those targets th at are close together will be treated in clusters. The \(now joint\ probability density for the cluster of targets will be temporally and measurement updated as a group. This computation is superlinear in the number of targets, but will only operate on targets in that cluster, rather than the entire target set. This method allows for careful physics-based modeling of the sensor returns when targets are close together e.g., including the expected coherent sums of energy from nearby targets and accurately modeling sidelobe interference\d will allow for more effective handling of crossing targets and convoy movements 6  A MBIGUOUS T ARGETS  In addition to left-right ambigu ity arising from linear arrays in the present setting there are intersection ambiguities. In the multisensor, multitarget, bearings-only environment we study here there are ambiguities arising from the \(persistent intersection of bearing measur ements across sensors from e.g., \(sensor 1, target 1\and \(sensor 2, target 2 Figure 9 gives an example of this phenomenon, by showing the multisensory conditional lik elihood surface in a highSNR and low-SNR case, respectivel y. In this example, there are two passive sensors, one lo cated at the northeast and one at the southeast of the surveillance region. There are two real targets indicated by white circles. Each passive sensor receives high energy at the b earings corresponding to the true targets as expected. This results in \(correct intersections at the true locati ons of the targets. However there are also false intersections, which correspond to the mismatched beams \(i.e., a beam from sensor 1, target 1 intersection with a beam from sensor 2, target 2 


  11 Ambiguous targets often move physically for some time and for that time are indistinguishable from real targets. This short term phenomenon is not a problem with the tracker but is a fundamental issue of physics. However, over time, the ambiguous targets can be distinguished from real targets in a tracking environment as they will move in a non-physical manner. Typically this non-physical motion takes the form of a jump movement as the ambiguities approach a line of symmetry defined by the nodes Figure 10 provides an illustration of this behavior. For the first 500 time steps \(shown at left\both the true targets green\d the ambiguous targ ets \(red\anner that is plausible physically. Ho wever, as shown at right after time step 500 the ambiguous targets move in a dramatically non-physical manner. This behavior is common and in this case is co rrelated with the ambiguity position moving through a sensor line of symmetry 7  M ULTITARGET D ETECTION   T RACKING I MPLEMENTATION  As discussed earlier, we have chosen to factorize the joint density into a collection of single target densities. This approach is optimal when targ ets are well separated but is inappropriate as targets beco me close in sensor space Future work includes an adaptive approach which will appropriately treat these closel y spaced targets jointly. In the present work however, we employ an engineering approach to cope with this sub optimality which prevents measurement sharing among cl osely spaced trackers. These algorithmic modifications mean that the final product is not simply multiple single target detection and tracking algorithms running in parallel First, we partition the surveillance region into multiple overlapping static detection grids. Each detection grid is a single target detector as described above for detecting   Figure 9 \226 Bearings intersections corresponding to true targets \(white circles nd ambiguous intersections There are two sensors, located NE and SE of the image, resp ectively. Each sensor has hi gh energy returns at the bearings corresponding to the true targ ets, yielding intersections at the true target locations. However, there are also false intersections between, for example, \(s ensor 1, target 1\ and \(sensor 2, target 2   Figure 10\226 Left: true and ambiguous trajectories for the fi rst 500 time steps of the simulation. Right: After time step 500, the ambiguous targets make large non-physical jumps 


  12 targets in its sub-region. We compute the target present hypothesis independently for each detector grid. It is desirable that each detector gr id is small in total spatial extent to allow detection of closely spaced targets since each individual detection grid is only capable of accurately modeling the target absent/present hypothesis when there is either a single target presen t or no targets present. In contrast, it is desirable that each grid is large enough \(in total spatial extent\o capture multiple time steps of measurements on a moving target to allow accurate computation of the target present hypothesis Second, the single target detector/tracker equations discussed above\update each detector grid. The temporal and measurement updates proceed as if there were a single target present on the grid, updating the target present hypothesis with the new data. In this manner, each detector grid performs the Bayes-optimal single target detection and tracking algorithm for its spatial region If the target present hypothesis associated with a detector exceeds a threshold, the algorith m declares a new target and initializes a tracking grid to follow the target. This target grid is mobile and continually re-centered on the predicted target location. It is desirable that this tracking grid is as small as feasible for both computational reasons and also to allow multiple closely spaced targets to be tracked on their own grids. However, the grid must be large enough in spatial extent to account for temporal uncertainties in target motion and measurement error The individual target temporal updates proceed exactly as in the single target case. The measurement updates of the detection and tracking grids use a measurement-censoring step not present in the single target tracker. This measurement censoring step is executed in lieu of fully estimating the joint multitarget density, and should be looked upon as an engineering method for dealing with closely spaced targets that is less costly than fully estimating the joint density. In experiments with real data it has been found that this method often provides sufficient accuracy to perform adequate tracking. However, it is our plan to look at joint density estimation as in [5  fu ture work To elaborate, measurements that fall into the spatial extent of any tracker are censored from the detectors. Second trackers compete for measurem ents based on their prior probabilities. These steps prevent multiple targets from being incorrectly detected at the same location, and also prevent multiple nearby trackers from simply following the strongest target On Grid Resolution Like the case of single target tracking, it is important that grid cell spatial resolution be chosen judiciously. If grid cells are too coarse, it is possible no cell centers will project into the maximum of the conditional likelihood \(refer back to Figure 7\However, even if the grid size too large, the behavior of the tracker may not be catastrophic. Typical behavior is that a detector initiates a track; the tracker follows the target for some period of time and terminates the track; then the detector reinitiates a tracker on the same target. Figure 11 illustrates the effect of grid cell resolution on tracking performance. The left panel shows performance when the grid is too coarsely spaced. The red dots show track termination points, and illustrate that a single target track is routinely broken and restarted when the grid spacing is too coarse. The right panel shows performance when grid spacing is appropriately sel ected. All track s are followed throughout the entire vignette w ith no track fragmentation Unlike the case of single target tracking, the multitarget case exhibits problems when the grid resolution is too small. In particular, since the multitarget detectors constantly seek new targets, small grid cell resolution can have the unintended consequence of allowing energy from the conditional update to bleed onto both a tracker \(correctly and the underlying detector \(incorrectly\nd thus generate   Figure 11 \226 Left: Multitarget tracking with \(too\coarse grid resolution. Right: Multitarget tracking with appropriately selected resolution. In both panels, red dots show track termi nation points, green lines show true target trajectories, and the other colo red lines show the track estimates 


  13 false \(double\argets Figure 12 illustrates this situation. The conditional update correctly updates the tracker wh ich is tasked with following the target. However, the detector which is partially spatially coincident with the tracker also receives energy from the conditional update. This can lead the detector to initiate falsely\second target nearby the first target This effect can be countered a number of ways. First, we can adjust the speed at which the tracker re-centers itself The double initialization phenomenon occurs when the PDF peaks near the edge of the tracker grid. However, this method has the side effect of potentially allowing probability to fall off of the grid in low SNR environments causing track loss. Of course if the SNR is low enough or measurement outages occur tracks will be dropped. Second a guardband around the tracker that does not allow any detector sufficiently near the tracker to receive reinforcement via the conditional density can mitigate the double target problem. However, this has the side effect of preventing detection of closely spaced targets. Third increasing the spatial extent of the tracker has a similar effect as the using a guardband. It does require increased computation, but generates a better representation of the posterior There are several engineering tradeoffs. The first is that large tracker grids \(or large guard bands\ prevent falsely detecting new targets because of conditional probability spill over. However, if applied too aggressively, this will prevent correctly detecting cl osely spaced targets. Second quick tracker grid translation correctly centers the target mass, again preventing spillover into nearby detectors However, overly liberal trac ker repositioning may in fact move trackers to spurious energy locations and drop true targets off of the finite grid On Ambiguous Targets As discussed earlier, ambiguous targets will eventually move non-physically and this will cause the tracker to remove them via its natural prediction and update process Figure 13 illustrates this phenomenon. There are two real targets that create two persistent ambiguities. All four are detected and tracked automati cally. The ambiguous targets however, eventually move non-physically due to their reliance on the node bearing angles. The tracker automatically penalizes the non-physical motion and the targets\222 present hypothesis decrease quickly over time Ambiguous target removal is done automatically in the Bayesian framework as follows The PDF on target state is predicted forward in time according to the kinematic model True targets will have behavior consistent with the kinematic model \(note the kinematic model is a statistical model so it is predicting a range of possibilities for the future target state\biguous targets may behave consistently with this model for a period of time, but eventually they will appear to perform a non-physical maneuver \(these epochs typically come when the ambiguous target crosses a line of symmetry in the sensor\this point, the predicted target position will be in strong disagreement with the inco ming measurements on that target. This mismatch in predicted target position and measurements leads to a decr ease in the target present hypothesis as calculated in eq. \(4\long, only true targets remain   Figure 12 \226 Improper selection of grid resolution leads to multiple initializations on the same target. Left Measurement update of a Tracker \(red=highest likelih ood, blue=lowest\Right Measurement update of a detector which lies near the Tracker.  Since the track er size has been improperly chosen, some energy from the measurements of a single target leak s on to the detector. This can le ad to false double-initializations 


  14 8  C ONCLUSION  This paper has described a Bayesian approach to detecting and tracking multiple moving targets using acoustic data from multiple passive arrays In contrast to traditional undersea acoustic systems, which develop tracks at the single array level and require track association, our approach fuses data at the m easurement level and operates directly in the target state space We have detailed a well known nonlinear filtering approach to single target detection and tracking [1, 4 and desc ri be d our computationally efficient finite-grid approach to the required density estimation. We have furthermore extended this to the multiple target case by employing a bank of single target detector tracke rs and approximation methods that adjust for closely spaced targets. This approximate approach avoids fully treating the computationally complex joint multitarget problem Future work includes modified approaches to posterior estimation including dynamic grid extent, dynamic grid resolution, and particle filtering. It is anticipated that adaptive sampling of the posterior will lead to computational savings. Furthermore, future work includes more detailed modeling and estimation of closely spaced targets allowing a more accurate representation of the joint target density. Naively implemented, this implies exponential growth \(in the number of targets\r the probability state space being es timated. However, recent work in a related tracking domain on adaptive density factorization [5 c h a stic sa m p lin g  p article filtering    pr ovi de m e t h o d s t h at m i t i g at e t h i s com put at i o n gr owt h  when the full joint density is treated  A PPENDIX  This section discusses the details of how the single target probability density is time evolved on a discrete grid.
