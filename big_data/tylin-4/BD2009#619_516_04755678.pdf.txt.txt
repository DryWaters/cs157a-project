Examining the combined impact of process and data standards on business process performance   Bjoern Muenstermann University of Bamberg muenstermann@is-bamberg.de Andreas Eckhardt University of Frankfurt eckhardt@is-frankfurt.de Tim Weitzel University of Bamberg weitzel@is-bamberg.de   Abstract What impact do process and data standards have on business process performance? This paper shows that process and data standards have a positive combined impact on business process performance measured in business process time, cost and quality This combined impact of process and data standards on business process performance is empirically confirmed using data from an annual study of the recruitment process among Germany?s Fortune 1,000 companies1. Building on the confirmed positive combined impact of process and data standards, the paper provides actionable managerial recommendations on how to achieve this impact   1. Introduction  Business process management \(BPM an important role in the evolution of organizations over the last few years. The importance of this field of research for researchers and practitioners alike can be seen in dedicated journals such as the "Business Process Management Journal \(BPMJ online resources including "Business Process Trends where "business managers, IT managers, vendors and practitioners come for news and information focused on trends, directions and best practices in business process change While a lot of research in this field has focused on technology ? for example how to best technically support BPM efforts ? this paper aims to move a step further forward, approaching BPM from a more businessdriven perspective. That is why we have focused on business process optimization as one sub-aspect of BPM, or to put a finer point on it we aim to better understand the role process and data standards play in optimizing business process performance  1 Germany?s largest 1,000 companies in terms of revenues Following the arguments provided by Muenstermann and Weitzel [22] we propose that a better understanding of the role process and data standards play in the business performance of a given business process might a quantifiable process and data standards are developed, b retical way to link BPM to business value research due to the business process focus and c with a more tangible understanding of BPM research and how to implement process and data standards as requested by many managers Unfortunately to date ? as far as we are aware there are no stringent empirical explorations of the combined impact of process and data standards on 


combined impact of process and data standards on business process performance. That is why this paper aims to answer the following research question  What is the combined impact of process and data standards on business process performance  To substantiate our theoretical findings we chose the recruitment process within enterprises as an exemplary business process and are able to provide empirical results from a survey that we sent out to HR executives responsible for recruitment in Germany?s largest 1,000 companies Our paper is structured as follows: First, we provide the theoretical foundations in section 2 and our research model in section 3. Then, we present the survey of the recruitment process in Germany?s Fortune 1,000 companies and the evaluation of the underlying research model in section 4. Finally, we conclude the paper by interpreting the results and discussing potential limitations and possibilities for further research in section 5  2. Theoretical foundations  Our main research goal is to determine whether the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE combination of process and data standards has a positive impact on business process performance. The growing interest shown by both researchers and practitioners in the value of process and data standards calls for an in-depth investigation \(e.g., [34 perspective there are several pertinent reasons to focus on this topic The first reason is the proposition that only standardized processes will show better performance [12,26 The second reason is that, focusing solely on data standards, cost benefits stemming from rationalization and automation or strategic benefits such as higher customer satisfaction can be expected [36 The third reason, which combines the first and second reasons, is that combining process and data standards aims to increase the business value of the enterprises that implement them [28,36 Only very little is known about the differential combined impact of process and data standards on business process performance and, in more general terms, on business value This paper aims to close this research gap by developing a relevant and measurable research model for the combined impact of process and data standards and also to validate and substantiate the research model based on a survey of the recruitment process in Germany?s Fortune 1,000 companies The following subsections present both process standards \(2.1 2.2 nate their combined impact \(2.3 wards our research model, which is presented in section 3  2.1 Process standards  Starting with a definition of a "business process", we follow one of the most common definitions given by Davenport and Short [7], who define a business process, as a "set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined business outcome As shown in Figure 1, Ferstl and Sinz [11] provide an enterprise architecture, which allows describing an 


an enterprise architecture, which allows describing an organization's enterprise model along the three "model layers enterprise plan, business process model, and resources Building on Ferstl and Sinz in our research we understand business processes as being influenced and driven by the enterprise plan, i.e. the business goal and strategy of the organization at hand. The business processes then need resources \(for example personnel or application systems business goal and strategy Enterprise plan Business process model Organization of personnel Business application systems Outside view of a business system Inside view of a business system Resources  Figure 1: Enterprise architecture2  While it is comparatively easy to find definitions of a "business process" in the \(IS cantly more difficult to find a definition of "standard or "standardization Trying to define "standard" or "standardization probably the most common definition has been provided by ISO/IEC: "Standards are documents, established by consensus and approved by a recognized body that provides, for common and repeated use rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context" [17]. Other authors like for example De Vries [8] go in even significantly more detail when defining "standard" and "standardization" and compare and synthesize a number of definitions given by others Combining the definitions of "business process standard" and "standardization" and trying to define business process standard" or "business process standardization", several authors have found that there is a lack of suitable literature: Von Stetten [31] points out that "there is not much relevant literature to be found Although some ideas can be borrowed from the rich business process improvement literature from the nineties only a very limited number of papers exist treating business process standardization' solely". Ungan [33 points out that "despite its great attractiveness, academics? and practitioners? work on [business] process standardization is conspicuously absent A rare counterexample is the work of S  nchezRodr  guez et al. [30] which assert that standardization of purchasing procedures and processes has a significant positive effect on both purchasing procedures and overall business performance. Muenstermann and Weitzel [22] provide an initial proposal for how to define a measurement construct for "business process standardization". In their literature review they summarize the potential benefit/value of process standards  2 Adapted from Ferstl and Sinz [11 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2

Consequently the overall quality and also customer confidence improves  2.2 Data standards  In contrast to process standards, which are quite an immature field of research as pointed out in the last section, the field of data standards has a substantially longer history ? even offering numerous contributions on the value of data standards According to Herwig [16] data standards aim to circumvent the problem that "different people from the business using the same process may have different understandings of the information entities they deal with What is probably the best known example of data standards is EDI \(electronic data interchange National Institute of Standards and Technology defines EDI in a 1996 publication [23] as "the computer-tocomputer interchange of strictly formatted messages that represent documents other than monetary instruments." Wigand et al. [36] for example extend prior EDI research to include newer XML-based vertical IS standards presenting a case study of the US mortgage industry. According to their work, the benefits of using EDI for individual organizations can be broken down into four categories as shown in Table 2  Table 2: Benefit/value of EDI \(data standards Benefit/value Example Operational benefits from better business document handling Reduced administrative costs Operational benefits from better use of electronically  Reduced cycle time  3 Adapted from Muenstermann and Weitzel [22 4 Adapted from Wigand et al. [36 captured information  Better deployment of customer-related resources Strategic benefits  New products/services  Increased revenue Non-economic benefits  Better relationships with business partners 


Non-economic benefits  Better relationships with business partners  Leaving EDI and looking at open data standards ODS  empirically the deployment of data standards in several European organizations and find that proprietary formats still dominate Although the field of data standards has a longer history than process standards ? as stated at the beginning of this subsection ? a common understanding and a widespread adoption of data standards still seem to be taking a long time  2.3 Combining process and data standards  Building on the experience of more than 40 case studies, Ross [28] describes how organizations can generate significant business value by capitalizing on architectural benefits. She distinguishes four "architectural stages  1. "An application silo architecture 2. a standardized technology architecture 3. a rationalized data architecture 4. a modular architecture  Following her line of argumentation, organizations can move from the silo to the modular architecture stage by implementing a set of measures and activities at each step. "Organizational learning at each stage helps them [organizations] understand how to realize benefits and how to position themselves for the next architectural stage To reach the rationalized data architecture stage Ross proposes to extend the enterprise-wide IT standards to data and processes. Hence, her research finds that the combined implementation of process and data standards can "generate significant business value 28 Wigand [36] states that it is consensus in literature that, whether initiators or adopters, organizations cannot get advanced operational benefits [?] or competitive benefits from use of EDI without both improving their business processes and integrating EDI with high-quality [?] systems". Once again, this finding indicates that implementing either process or data standards does not necessarily guarantee increased business process performance or increased business value A data standard should not be considered to be an end in itself. Rather, a data standard needs to be embedded in the surrounding process or process landProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 scape. Just introducing data standards without adapting the processes involved does not promise success. Most data standardization activities seen over the last few years also involved some process standardization activities. Likewise, it does not seem pertinent to only standardize processes without considering the data handled by the processes. On the contrary most process standardization activities necessitate analyzing data structures and simultaneously standardizing them Encouraged by the cited findings and the presented research results on process and data standards, as a very first step to approach the interplay of process and data standards we propose to investigate the combined impact of process and data standards, and to then analyze their impact on business process performance Most authors measure business process performance with three dimensions: time, cost and quality 21]. We follow this approach in this paper and adapt 


the three dimensions for our purposes as shown in Table 9 in the appendix We decided to measure business process performance using the three business process measurement dimensions business process time, cost and quality for the following reasons: These dimensions are frequently employed by other researchers, allowing us to build on their experience and easily adapt mature constructs to our research context. These dimensions can easily be measured, thus allowing objective and reproducible verification. Other \("softer ibility, agility or robustness of the process at hand would have been much more difficult to measure and would not have allowed objective or reproducible verification This leads us to our three hypotheses H1-H3, in which we suggest that the combined effect of process and data standards has a positive and direct impact on each of the business process performance measurement dimensions time, cost and quality. The hypotheses are summarized in Table 3 below  Table 3: Hypotheses in research model Number Hypothesis H1 The combined effect of process and data standards has a positive and direct impact on business process time H2 The combined effect of process and data standards has a positive and direct impact on business process cost H3 The combined effect of process and data standards has a positive and direct impact on business process quality  3. Research model  Based on the three hypotheses described in the previous section we assume a combined effect of data and process standards on the three determinants of business process performance: business process time cost and quality. Our research model is shown in Figure 2 below   Figure 2: Research model5  3.1 Construct operationalization  All indicators of the respective constructs in our research model are measured in reflective mode. We quantified all single items on a 7-point Likert scale using scales from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree". We used five first order constructs and one second order construct \(Combined P&amp;D Standards We measured our second order construct in the regular way using all indicators of the prior antecedents [6 All constructs in our research model were questioned in a survey in German. We translated the individual items into German by using the back-translation method [3] in order to quantify the underlying theories The detailed operationalization can be found in Table 9 in the appendix  3.2 Data collection procedure  In 2007, we sent a paper-based questionnaire to HR executives responsible for recruitment in Germany?s largest 1,000 companies in terms of revenues. The overall response rate was 19.1% as 191 evaluable ques 


overall response rate was 19.1% as 191 evaluable questionnaires out of 1,000 were returned. Additionally, the sample is not biased to a potential missing value problem, as all 191 data sets do not contain more than 50 missing values. Finally, the sample was successfully tested for representativeness \(using criteria such as revenue and number of employees sentativeness for Germany's largest 1,000 companies  5 "P&amp;D" means "process and data Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4  3.3 Research subject  We chose the staff recruitment process as our research subject to investigate the combined impact of data and process standards on business process performance. We examined the recruitment process for the following reasons: First, as Figure 3 below shows Human Resources and especially recruitment as a supporting element is cross-linked to the corporate production processes and all other sub-processes and therefore is fundamental for the day-to-day business. Second, in the modern digitalised business world, recruitment is named as a top issue for executives [20]. This is due to factors including the rising global shortage of highly qualified employees such as IT workers [27]. This talent shortage calls for companies to rethinking recruitment in order to develop new strategies to overcome this serious threat [14]. A new upcoming strategy adopted by several corporations in Europe and the US with global operations is to standardize the entire staff recruitment process [31 We used the description for a staff recruitment process by Faerber et al. [10] to operationalize our constructs. The following figure shows our understanding of a recruitment process; it is adapted to Porter's value chain model [25]. Breaugh and Starke [2] provide additional specifications and descriptions of the staff recruitment process   Figure 3: Research subject  the recruitment process  4. Data analysis  We measured our structural equation model using the procedure suggested by Chin [4-6], Bagozzi and Yi 1] as well as Straub et al. [32]. We used Partial Least Squares to evaluate our path model and to conduct ttests for significance. The level of significance for support or rejection of hypotheses was chosen as p=0.999 All single items in our study have been derived from IS literature about process and data standards as well as from HR literature about staff recruitment. We operationalized all constructs used in our research model in reflective mode. Finally we used PLS to evaluate and analyze the measurement as well as the structural model. In contrast to covariance-based approaches such as  LISREL, AMOS or EQS, PLS has minimal demands on measurement scales and residual distribution [6  4.1 Measurement model  According to Bagozzi [1] the quality of the reflective measurement model is determined by four specified factors: content validity, indicator reliability, construct reliability and discriminant validity Content validity shows the degree to which the re 


Content validity shows the degree to which the results gained represent the content-semantic part of the construct [35]. A necessary condition for the evaluation of content validity is a precise definition of the content of the respective constructs. In order to provide content validity we evaluated our constructs in detail with several staff recruitment experts at German companies [9 Indicator reliability can be proven by looking at the loadings of all constructs measured in reflective mode The loadings should be above the recommended threshold of 0.7 [13]. In a primary status of scale development, loadings between 0.5 and 0.6 are also acceptable [4]. All reflective items in our measurement model are significant at the p=0.999 level and above the recommended 0.7 parameter value. All indicator loadings under 0.5 parameter value were excluded beforehand. T-tests for the significance of the individual loadings could be conducted by using the bootstrap routine with at least 200 samples [5]. The following table provides an overview for all indicator loadings as well as their respective t-values  Table 4: Indicator reliability Original Sample Sample Mean T Statistics Process Stand. \(1 Process Stand. \(2 Process Stand. \(3 Process Stand. \(4 Process Stand. \(5 Process Stand. \(6 Data Standards \(1 Data Standards \(2 Data Standards \(3 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 Data Standards \(4 Data Standards \(5 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(1 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(2 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(3 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(4 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(5 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(6 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(7 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(8 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(9 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(10 Combined P&amp;D Standards \(11 Process Time \(1 Process Time \(2 Process Time \(3 Process Cost \(1 Process Cost \(2 Process Cost \(3 Process Cost \(4 Process Quality \(1 Process Quality \(2 Process Quality \(3 


Process Quality \(3 Process Quality \(4  Construct reliability demands that all indicators related to the same construct should strongly correlate with each other [13] in the reflective measurement model. To test construct reliability we must check how the items run together. Unlike the test for indicator reliability, this test only looks at the items of the same construct and not across constructs. Construct reliability was tested using composite reliability \(CR as the average variance extracted \(AVE mated values were above the recommended thresholds of 0.6 for CR and 0.5 for AVE [1]. Another quality criterion that can be used to insure construct reliability is Cronbach's-Alpha. Values close to 1.0 indicate greater reliability [15]. The following table provides an overview of all of the relevant quality criteria  Table 5: Quality criteria AVE Composite Reliability Cronbach's Alpha Process Cost 0.8701 0.964 0.951 Data Standards 0.8691 0.9706 0.9612 Process Standards 0.9112 0.9839 0.9795 Process Quality 0.8871 0.9691 0.957 Comb. P&amp;D Stand. 0.7429 0.9693 0.9649 Process Time 0.9299 0.9755 0.9622  Discriminant validity occurs when the items do not differ as intended. This can be proven by looking at the cross-loadings. The loadings of our reflective items need to be higher for their respective constructs than for any other. As the results for the cross loadings in our appendix show, we were able to confirm this for our research model. Moreover, the square root of the AVE for each construct is higher than the correlations between the individual constructs. As a result, in our research model the discriminant validity of the latent variables is high [13]. The latent variable correlations for our research model are presented in the following table  Table 6: Latent variable correlations Proc.

4.2 Structural model  In order to determine the value of the overall research model, a number of coefficients must be evaluated. These parameters show the extent to which the hypothesized relations could be observed empirically Two of the most important measures are discussed for our research model: path coefficients and the explained variance R   The path coefficients describe the strength of the relationship between two latent variables. Their minimum value should be at least 0.1. The significance of the path coefficients could be verified by running a bootstrap routine with 200 samples. As the results in the following figure show, all path coefficients in our research model are highly significant on the p=0.999 level The explanatory contribution of the structural model can be examined by using R  This determination coefficient visualizes the degree of explained variance usProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 ing the endogenous latent variables. The explanatory power of R  is classified by [4]. All R  values in our structural model are between 0.465 and 0.339, so we can say that the explanatory power is average Figure 4 shows the empirical results of the survey conducted  Combined P&amp;D Standards Process Cost R2 = 0.405 Process Quality R2 = 0.339 Process Time R2 = 0.465 Process Standards Data Standards *** = p &gt; 0.999 p &gt; 0.995 p &gt; 0.990 0.682 t = 8.738 0.651 t = 25.722 0.441 t = 18.204 0.636 t = 8.040 0.582 t = 6.246  Figure 4: Evaluation Research Model  5. Interpretation of the results  This section interprets our research model according to its hypotheses, theoretically based in section 2 and empirically evaluated in section 3. All three major hypotheses of our research model could be corroborated as shown in the following  H1: The hypothesized positive relation between the combined impact of data and process standards and a reduction of the process time has been corroborated The path coefficient is significant on level p &lt;= 0.001  H2: The hypothesis that the combined impact of data and process standards positively affects process 


data and process standards positively affects process costs, has been corroborated. The path coefficient for this relationship is highly significant \(p &lt;= 0.001  H3: The forecasted positive impact of a combined standard force on the quality determinant of the recruiting process has been corroborated for this sample with p &lt;= 0.001  5.1 Implications for theory  In this paper we developed a theoretical research model around the combined effect of process and data standards on business process performance in staff recruitment. Such a model has not yet been offered in human resources information systems \(HRIS research In addition, this paper provides empirical substantiation and validation of the developed hypothesis using data from a survey sent to Fortune-1,000 companies in Germany. The results show that a sensible combination of process and data standards in staff recruitment has a positive impact on the outcomes of the entire recruiting process. These outcomes are measured as time-to-hire costs-per-hire as well as the process quality for applicants \(customer satisfaction quality of hired candidates With these two main contributions, the paper fills a gap in existing literature and can serve as starting point for promising future research Our results were not fully able to answer how exactly both standard types should be combined to provide the positive impact. As indicated in section 2.3 we assume that neither process nor data standards are an end in themselves. Quite a high number of cases show that the introduction of process standards is more successful if accompanied by a simultaneous introduction of data standards. Some cases show that data standards tend to fail if not embedded in a process standardization context. We leave a further discussion of the operative interplay of process and data standards for further research \(compare section 5.4 In their case study research about the use of process standards in staff recruitment, von Stetten et al. [31 showed that the observed company implemented a uniform data standard and then process standards on how to recruit an employee. In this case the company was able to cut their costs by a third and reduced their timeto-hire by around 20 days from 90 to 70  5.2 Managerial implications  The most important finding of this research is that the combined implementation of process and data standards in staff recruitment has a positive and direct impact on the overall performance of the recruiting process \(measured in time-to-hire, costs-per-hire and the process quality for applicant and company These empirical findings confirm the results of case study research by von Stetten et al. [31] who examined the positive influence of standardization in staff recruitment. Managers in HR and IT could benefit from this approach and enhance their efforts to standardize the corporate recruitment process. An important precondition seems to be a prior implementation of a uniform data standard before starting to standardize the process von Stetten et al. [31]. Examples of process standards could be related to the specific recruiter tasks, the channels they use to find and attract a specific applicant as well as the ways they communicate with their candidates. Several companies use standard chanProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 


Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 nels to attract candidates, such as their corporate website or an Internet job portal such as Monster.com [18 How candidates apply and companies communicate with their candidates is also becoming increasingly standardized in current staff recruitment as the candidates frequently use standardized web forms to apply and the companies use email for communication [19 Finally a rising degree of standardization in staff recruitment will lead to a new definition of recruiters tasks as one recruiter will not be responsible for performing the entire process from candidate attraction to final selection  Table 7: Overview of managerial implications Implications Combined implementation of process and data standards in staff recruitment has a positive and direct impact on the overall performance of the recruiting process Authors,[31 A uniform data standard \(for applicant relevant information standardization \([31 Standardized channels to first attract applicants and then communicate with them ? as a means of process standardization ? increase the overall performance of the recruiting process \(Authors,[18],[19 Increasing specialization and modularization of a single recruiter's activities ? as a means of process standardization ? increase the overall performance of the recruiting process \(Authors  5.3 Limitations  As with any work in a new field of research, relevant literature to build on is almost nonexistent. Following Wuellenweber et al. [37] "in standardization research determining the value of a standard has remained an open issue for decades. Looking at process standards, things seem to be even worse." Unfortunately the operationalization of "process standard" used in this paper could thus not build too much on earlier work in standardization research. As a result we focused the operationalization of prior findings of HR research As with any empirical research paper, this work has some associated limitations. We have only discussed one process to examine the combined impact of process and data standards, so the significant results might show a single example for the recruitment process. We assume there might be differences for different processes. Future research should discuss this aspect in more detail Furthermore, our survey was limited to major enterprises in Germany. Therefore our results may not be directly transferred to any other country or region In addition, our results could be affected by common method variance because we collected the data from participants at the same time using the same questionnaire [24  5.4 Further research  In this paper, we have shown that combined process and data standards have a positive impact on business process performance in terms of the individual measuring dimensions of business process time, cost and quality for our overall data sample of major German enterprises. We assume that interesting future results might be provided by looking at specific industry \(sub tors, branches or companies of different sizes \(e.g 


tors, branches or companies of different sizes \(e.g large-scale vs. SME Building on the proposal of the "business process standardization" construct by Muenstermann and Weitzel [22], future research should try to further improve the operationalization of "process standards In this paper we measured business process performance using the three business process measurement dimensions of business process time, cost and quality It might be interesting to complement these by adding softer" dimensions, such as business process flexibility, agility or robustness This paper offers an initial understanding of the interplay between process and data standards. Moreover in our further research, we will investigate the individual and separate influence of process and data standards on process performance. Is the influence of process standardization higher than that of data standardization? Do they conflict with each other In addition we will complete two more case studies and send out a new questionnaire to Germany?s Fortune 1,000 companies that will then allow us to analyze the influence of both process and data standardization on each of the business process performance measurement dimensions \(time, cost and quality In addition, we also aim to investigate whether most firms started their standardization effort \(process and data ture \(or even thereafter pendently of major IT changes Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 6.

especially of computer networks, is often characterized by the multi-state performance degradations before reaching the complete failure. This multi-state nature of reliability has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and the most significant advances have been in the field of multistate reliability modeling \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003                                                 4. STRATEGIC MODELING AND DYNAMIC   Box 3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis  Dependence Mechanisms  Dependence is often the central focus of multivariate survival analysis, and together with censoring, they complicate survival analysis most significantly. Hougaard \(2000 three mechanisms of dependence: \(i ii iii Common events are equivalent to common mode failures in reliability analysis, for example, failure events due to accidents or natural disasters. The common risks mechanism describes the scenario that the individuals are dependent due to some common unobserved risks such as common genes in siblings or a bug in the operating system that may affect all software running on 


operating system that may affect all software running on it. The third mechanism, event-related mechanism refers to the phenomena that the actual event itself changes the risk, such as virus infection of a computer node Shared Frailty Modeling  Shared frailty theory occupies the central focus of multivariate survival analysis. The dominance is not accidental because frailty captures crucial but often directly unobservable \(latent random variables, which are attributable for dependence and variations. To some extent, dependence, variation randomness, and frailty all address some facets of multivariate failure events. The frailty theory provides a unique set of approaches to address the theoretical and practical issues related to those four concepts.  Similar to the fact that censoring is the trademark feature of survival analysis \(both univariate and multivariate frailty theory is the trademark of multivariate survival analysis. These two trademark properties, censoringhandling and frailty modeling, have made multivariate survival analysis a unique and indispensable mathematical tool for biomedical and public health research Multi-State Modeling  Multi-state has been developed concurrently in several fields in the last decade, including survival analysis \(Hougaard 2000 reliability \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003 Commenges 1999 Huzurbazar 2006 multi-state modeling has been adopted to solve the domain specific problems, and the flow graph modeling offers a flexible and powerful approach to analyze multi-state models in general.

The transition probabilities in multi-states modeling are well defined by survivor functions \(Hougaard 2000 multi-state model is to estimate the state transition probabilities from hazards functions. multivariate system. According to Lisnianski and Levitin's \(2003 any systems that can have a finite number of performance rates are multi-state systems. Furthermore a system may consists of components which themselves could be multi-state subsystems 10 4. STRATEGIC LEVEL MODELING AND DYNAMIC HYBRID FAULT MODELS  Hybrid fault models are derived from agreement algorithms Lynch 1997 redundancy management in fault tolerance.  Therefore, the choice of hybrid fault models directly affects reliability analysis and fault tolerance. Despite the close ties between reliability and fault tolerance fields, Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e Ma 2008a with regard to the quantitative relationship between reliability analysis and hybrid fault models. To address the unrealistic assumption, they proposed a new concept  dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF mathematical tools \(survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling we first briefly describe the issues involved and summarize some of their key findings in Box 4.1  Agreement algorithms started out with the introduction of the Byzantine general problem by Pease et al. \(1980 Lamport \(1982 system are abstracted as generals of an army.  Loyal generals \(non-faulty components algorithm e.g., to attack or retreat while traitors \(or bad components others by sending conflicting messages. Because the focus of agreement algorithms is to reach agreement in the presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the 


presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
