Introduction  South Korea has a long history of informatization of local public administration as she first initiated the plan for the National Five Basic Computer Networks NFBCN government tried to build nation-wide computer networks in the areas of public administration banking industry, education and research, and national defense and police. Having the basic computer network infrastructure in place, the Middle and Long Term Comprehensive Plan for Local Administration Informatization was set up in 1993. In accordance with this plan, 188 out of total 234 local governments newly established computing divisions as a part of their permanent organizational structure Besides, as the national effort for informatization greatly stepped up in the middle of 90s, the undertaking of the 1st Stage Comprehensive Informatization of Chi, Gun, Gu1 was launched in 1997 for the purpose of computerizing 10 major public service areas, which were citizen registration real estate registration, vehicle administration environmental management, health and welfare administration, public finance and tax administration etc. The second stage of the undertaking was carried out from 2001 to 2003 to computerize 11 other major public service areas, including regional development culture and athletics, forestry, road and transportation, civic defense and safety, water utility etc The e-government undertaking for local public administration have been largely initiated and implemented by the central government in a top 


implemented by the central government in a topdown manner. However, the results of the egovernment undertaking seem to be quite uneven amongst local governments. It also seems that at least a part of the reason for the uneven results lies in the top-down approach itself. As the plans by the central government and its outsourced partner-usually system integration \(SI the differential needs of local governments for IT use and as local governments vary in their capacity to use IT, the levels of organizational assimilation of IT are also different between local governments This study investigates levels of organization assimilation of information system in local governments and analyses factors affecting their levels of IT assimilation. Especially, this study tries to answer the following questions: 1 information systems being assimilated in terms of their uses to carry out departmental tasks? Are there any systematic differences in the levels of assimilation between different departments, as well as between different local governments? 2 important factors affecting the level of IT assimilation? Especially, are the factors such as the nature of tasks, types of knowledge handled ? for example, levels of knowledge codification importance of implicit knowledge in daily operation  1 Chi is city government, while Gun generally exists in rural areas Gu is found in metropolitan cities Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE   etc. -, organizational structure, and organizational culture relevant? 3 relevant with organizational assimilation of IT? In an effort to address these questions, this study will adopt a regression analysis using a survey of departments of Korean Chi, Gun, and Gu conducted in 2006  2. Overview of Local e-Government in South Korea  E-government undertakings at the local level in South Korea are best represented by the project of comprehensive informatization of Chi, Gun, and Gu first launched in 1997. The project of comprehensive informatization of Chi, Gun, Gu covers 21 major public services provided by the local governments The project was carried out in a top-down and comprehensive manner, so that the Chi-Gun-Gu system covered every 232 local governments and the 1st stage system went into operation at once at the end of 2000. Behind the strong and top-down initiative for local e-government lies the organizational turf strategy by the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs MOGAHA building e-government. The MOGAHA?s pursuit of local e-government coincided with rapid devolution of administrative authorities to local governments and thereby its changing role in local public administration [7] [8 Carrying out the 1st stage project, the MOGAHA and its outsourcing partner-Samsung SDS- spent its first year conducting administrative business process reengineering\(PBPR ru1es, and institutions. A pilot project for the 1st stage was also carried out for a year from September of 1998 in 4 local governments \(Suwon Chi 


of 1998 in 4 local governments \(Suwon Chi Kwangju Seo Gu, Chungju Chi, South Jeju Gun deployment of the system to the whole local governments started in December of 1999. The 1st stage system went into full operation from October of 2000 after a month of nation-wide test run. For the diffusion of the system, some 700 servers were installed in 232 local governments connecting about 56,000 microcomputers The 2nd stage project complemented and supplemented the 1st stage project. While the 1st stage Chi-Gun-Gu system covered the service areas of ?immediate needs,? the 2nd stage system provided applications for more complex and advanced public services building on the services offered by the 1st stage system. Besides, in addition to the expansion of the coverage of public service areas, the 2nd stage project tried to interconnect major private institutions such as bank with government institutions for processing transactions. As of 2006, The MOGAHA is planning on upgrading the Chi-Gun-Gu system The main purpose of the upgrade is to increase the flexibility of the system and accommodate more effectively variant needs of local governments  3. Theoretical Background and Hypotheses  3.1. Perspective on Assimilation  Technology assimilation usually refers to the extent to which the use of a technology permeates organizational work processes and becomes embedded in the activities associated with those processes [6] [9]. Given that an information technology needs to be used before resulting in any organizational impact, assimilation is inevitably a key element in the causal chain of influence connecting the organizational adoption of an information technology with organizational performance. For this reason, the behavior concerning the adoption of information technology has been a subject of various theoretical and empirical endeavors The technology acceptance model\(TAM good example of rather successful attempts to explain the behavior of technological adoption at the individual level. The TAM assumes that the individual?s decision to use an information system is mainly influenced by two factors: the perceived usefulness of the system and the perceived ease of use [11] [12]. Venkatesh and Davis \(2000 an elaboration of the TAM where they posited that an individual?s intention to use an information system is influenced by the social influence processes and cognitive instrumental processes. Here, the social influence processes are shaped by subjective norm voluntariness ? i.e. internalization of social influence and image in a reference group, while the cognitive instrumental processes are shaped by job relevance output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use While the TAM has provided an excellent social psychological account of the use of information technology at the individual level, it does not explain the behavior of IT adoption at the organizational level. Meanwhile, Debabroto et al.\(2000 viewed organizational assimilation as a cumulative result of individual actions concerning the use of information technology, put forth a model of assimilation based on institutional theory. In other words, they argued that the organization influence individual cognition and behavior through 


individual cognition and behavior through Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2   structuration of significance, legitimacy, and dominance, and that organizational assimilation results from individual cognition and behavior concerning the use of IT such influenced by the organization. Debabroto et al.\(2000 as three organizational variables to influence the structuration of individuals top management championship, strategic investment rationale, and extent of coordination It seems not at all certain that organizational assimilation could be viewed as a cumulative result of individual adoption of information technology Indeed, most studies of assimilation have rather focused on organizational variables so that assimilation has normally been defined as the extent to which information technology is embedded in the organizational work processes, and that assimilation as a dependent variable has been related with organizational-level independent variables Specifically, Collins et al. focused on structural variables such as complexity, formalization of rules and procedures, and the decentralization of authority as predictors of organization adoption of technology in the context of 54 manufacturing firms[23]. Taking a technology diffusion approach to assimilation Cooper and Zmud tried to relate IT implementation with task and technology characteristics in the context of manufacturing firms[24]. Ranganathan et al. focused on the level of managerial IT knowledge as well as organizational structure as predictors of web technology assimilation in the supply-chain management function.[9 Researchers of technology assimilation have looked as predictors into various clusters of variables that pertain to structural characteristics ? structural perspective -, characteristics of production technologies like the physical processes, techniques and tools ? technoeconomic perspective -, or characteristics of interaction between structure and technology ? sociotechnical systems perspective [23 They have also taken on different approaches to explain technology assimilation, which include technology diffusion approach, organizational learning approach, and so on. Meanwhile, the organizational culture, which has recently been much studied as a predictor of organizational performance due in part to the rise of sociological institutional theory, has scarcely been tested as a predictor of organizational assimilation. Besides, the empirical studies of organizational assimilation have mostly been conducted in the context of manufacturing organizations while information technology has been making earthquakes in the public non-manufacturing organizations  3. 2. Developing Hypotheses  3. 2. 1. Organization Structure and Assimilation  Researchers typically have focused on centralization, formalization, and complexity as structural dimensions relevant to organization output 26]. 2 Ever since the seminar work by Burns and Stalkers \(1961 innovation and mechanical organizational design many studies of organizational innovation have reported that centralized and hierarchical structure 


reported that centralized and hierarchical structure tends to hinder organizational adoption and diffusion of new technologies [13][17] [25 Especially in the context of assimilation of telecommunication technologies, Grover and Goslar found that there was a negative relation between centralization and the adoption of technologies[35 Accordingly, decentralized structures and crossfunctional coordination mechanisms are often suggested as ways to facilitate the IT assimilation processes[6]. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis  H1: Centralization is negatively associated with assimilation of information technology H2: Formalization is negatively associated with assimilation of information technology  3. 2. 2. Organizational Culture and Assimilation  Organizational culture is the pattern of shared meaning in an organization [34. While organizational culture has been focused as an essential element influencing organizational output and performance the construct has been scarcely tested against assimilation of technology. Amid those few empirical researches, In an effort to relate organizational culture with organization effectiveness, Quinn and Rohrbaugh have developed a competing values framework, where they put forth four models of cultural explanation of organization effectiveness i.e., human relations model, open-systems model internal process model, and rational goal model[24 To define the four types of value models, they used three dimensions of competing values: internal vs external focus for organizational focus, stability vs flexibility for organizational structure, processes vs  2  Centralization: The degree of centralization in an organization is the degree to which power and authority concentrate at the organiz ation?s higher levels. Formalization: formalization is the extent to which an organization?s structures and procedures are formality est ablished in written rules and regulations. Complexity: complexity i s measured in terms of the number of subunits, levels and specializ ations in an organization Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3   final outcomes for organizational means and ends This competing value framework in turn has served as a basis to develop a typology of organizational culture, which comprises rational, relational hierarchical, and developmental organizational culture[24 In accordance with the competing values framework and the subsequently developed typology of organizational culture, the following hypotheses are proposed relating characteristics of organizational culture and assimilation  H3: Rational Organization Culture is positively associated with the assimilation of information technology H4: Hierarchical Organization Culture is negatively associated with the assimilation of information technology  3. 2. 3. Information Resource Management and Assimilation  Johnston and Carrico argue that organizations 


which utilize information technology successfully are typically characterized by more direct contacts between the IT and program divisions, the presence of a mechanism for program divisions to influence the IT function, and the integration of the IT and organizational strategy functions[15] Besides, Igbaria points out that the employee?s IT satisfaction is positively associated with the quality of the support by the IT department[18]. In accordance with these findings, we propose the following hypothesis  H5: The quality of Managing Information Resource Management is positively associated with the assimilation of information technology  3. 2. 4. The Nature of Task, Knowledge Type and Assimilation  Simon once pointed out that even the most sophisticated IT could be an appropriate tool only if its data requirements were met[33]. Meanwhile, Daft and MacIntosh \(1978, 1981 needs differed depending on task characteristics It is not only structure, but organizational technology itself that influences the capacity for subsequent innovations[23]. Organizational technology in turn may well be related to the characteristics of organizational tasks and task environment. Meanwhile, this technoeconomic view on organizational innovation and assimilation coincides with the organizational learning perspective on assimilation in terms of the role of existing technologies. In this vein, Fichman and Kemerer found using the sample of 608 IT organizations that assimilation of technology is related to the scale of activities over which learning costs can be spread, the level of existing knowledge related to the focal innovation, and the diversity of technical knowledge and activities[28]. Accordingly, the following hypotheses are proposed concerning the influence of organizational tasks and knowledge on assimilation of information technology  H6: The level of knowledge codification is positively associated with the assimilation of information technology H7: The routinization of daily operation is positively associated with the assimilation of information technology   Figure 1. The conceptual model of the research  G   4. Method and Results  4. 1. Methods  To test the hypotheses, we administered a survey on three departments - i.e., IS department, department of transportation administration, and department of tax administration - in 234 Korean local governments carried out during February of 2006. Questions were asked to department heads. Total number of samples was 702. The final response rate 20.0% \(197/702, IS department=70, department of transportation administration=61, and department of tax administration=66 refusals and any incomplete responses. 3  [See 


refusals and any incomplete responses. 3  [See Appendix 1  3  The unit of analysis is the department with the assimilation of in Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4   Assimilation of information technology was measured by asking respondents to rate the extent to which the use of information technology is embedded in the department?s task processes. Four questions were used to operationalize this construct Organizational culture was measured in terms of four constructs: rational culture, developed culture hierarchy culture, and group culture. SPSS 12.0 was chosen to conduct ANOVA and regression analyses Factor analyses were also performed to create independent variables such as organizational culture knowledge type, the quality of information resource management, etc.[See Appendix 2  4. 2. Results  The regression equation model of this study can be summarized as the following Organizational assimilation = ?1\(Organizational Centralization Organizational Formalization 3\(The nature of task Knowledge type 5\(Rational culture Developed culture 7\(Hierarchical culture Group culture 9\(Information resource management  Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the results of pearson?s correlation and regression analyses respectively. The nine independent variables are expected to relate dependent variables and predict them. The R2 of the regression model is 0.292 and the adjusted R2 is 0.245. To examine whether the regression model suffers from multicollinearity tolerance has been calculated. Tolerance is a method of detecting the severity of multicollinearity, where 0 stands for perfect collinearity and 1 indicates no collinearity. As seen in Table 4, there was no serious evidence of multicollinearity among the variables The Durbin Watson test of correlated error is designed to determine whether there is first order correlation in the error term. Since the DurbinWatson statistic of 1.856 is above the cut-off value there is no evidence of serial correlation in the model   Table 1.

Note: ** p&lt;0.01,  * p&lt;0.05  The results of the regression analysis indicates that organizational structure, organizational culture rational management are statistically significantly related with organizational assimilation of information technology. Especially, as to the impact of organizational culture, rational culture turns out to be positively related with assimilation. The nature of task, level of knowledge codification, hierarchical

Table 3 summarizes the results of hypotheses testing The F statistic is 6.309\(p&lt;0.01 the model fits the data. Among the independent variables, organizational centralization, rational culture, information resource management were statistically significant in predicting organization assimilation. ?Information resource management? has the largest impact on the dependent variable, t= 2.547\(p&lt;0.01 hypothesis 5 is supported by the results. The variable rational culture? has the second largest impact on the dependent variable with the result of t=2.537\(p&lt;0.01 supported by the regression results.

The coefficients of the other variables: ?the nature of task,? ?knowledge type,? ?developed culture hierarchical culture,? ?group culture? are not statistically significant at 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10 level Therefore, hypotheses 2, 4, 6 ,7 are not supported by the regression results   Table 3.

Discussion and Conclusions  This study examined factors influencing organization assimilation of information technology in the context of Korean local governments. Of particular interests was the influence of organizational culture and types of knowledge on assimilation. The result of this study can be summarized as follows First, centralization is negatively associated with assimilation of IT. It seems that structural perspective on organizational innovation has been upheld again by this study Second, rational organizational culture is positively associated with assimilation of IT. As Debabroto et al. \(2002 assimilation of IT could be regarded as a cumulative result of actions by individuals and units within the 


result of actions by individuals and units within the organization. These actions of assimilation, in turn are stimulated or discouraged by an organizational milieu of norms, values, and rules. To the extent that assimilation of IT lies in the arena of rational choice of individuals, organizations may be able to foster assimilation by providing appropriate incentives Third, the quality of information resource management is positively associated with organizational assimilation of IT. The capacity of IT department in providing end-user support and enduser participation in IT project planning continue to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6   be important in promoting the organizational assimilation of IT   6.

managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
