In many cases, however, existing data is incomplete, and it may not be economically feasible nor time-wise plausible to begin an extensive data collection process. Aiming at the healthcare management systems that maintain the log of operation activities using timestamps, we propose a general method to process incomplete timestamp data and obtain necessary information for simulation analysis The proposed method is successfully applied to a case study of a mid-size hospital in Korea   1. Introduction  Simulation-based analysis has been a useful approach for hospital service process optimization There exists a large body of research work to improve resource utilization and to reduce patient waiting time of general hospitals by modifying reservation system space planning, and staff assignment. In [1] and [2 simulation analysis was used to evaluate the appointment scheduling methods for minimizing the influence of no-show patients. In [3], Harper reduced patient waiting time via appointment scheduling. In 4], Vanberkel used simulation analysis for efficient capacity planning and reducing waiting time of general surgery Existing simulation studies typically assume that a complete set of data is readily available for analysis Partially due to this requirement, they have focused on the case of large-size general hospitals where extensive data collection is feasible. The cost may be justified in large-size hospitals, because waiting time reduction usually leads to a big financial payoff. In [5], Isken used sensor networks for data collection in a hospital In [6], Morrison developed a customized system for collecting accurate data for simulation analysis These days, enhancing the quality of healthcare services, such as shortening waiting time and/or providing open-access policy, becomes an important issue even in mid-size hospitals. Even in small- to midsize clinics, computerized health care management systems have replaced traditional paper based patient charts and have stored into a database not only patient information but also service-process related information. In most mid-size hospitals, however, the information recorded in their database is incomplete and it may not be economically feasible nor time-wise plausible for them to begin an extensive data collection 


plausible for them to begin an extensive data collection process as in general hospitals. In this paper, we deal with the issue of utilizing such pre-existing but incomplete data for simulation study As a case study, we conduct a simulation study of a mid-size hospital, located in Seoul, Korea. The hospital under this study has two departments: the orthopedics department and the internal department. The hospital has operated since May 2003, and their service activity records during the year of 2006 are used in simulation Without loss of generality, we focus only on orthopedics outpatients. The hospital employs about 120 staffs and manages various facilities for check-in payment, consultation, X-Ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound lab test, physical therapy, and surgery. Table 1 summarizes the service processes and the number of servers \(staffs servers for the consultation process varies depending on the time and day. A dedicated staff is assigned to handle the X-ray equipment. Ultrasound, CT, MRI, and BMD equipments in examination rooms are managed by 2 technical staffs. Physical therapy is operated by 7 therapists, where patients may be served by a single therapist simultaneously. Some facilities like surgery are not applicable to outpatients   This research was in part supported by the MKE\(The Ministry of Knowledge Economy Information Technology Research Center IITA\(Institute for Information Technology Advancement IITA2008-C1090-0803-0004 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE Process Number of servers Check-in 1 Consultation 2~3 X-Ray* 1 Ultrasound 2 CT* MRI BMD Payment 1 Physical therapy 7 Lab test 2 Table 1 ? Processes and the number of servers in each process. \(The processes with * are shared with the internal department  Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of orthopedics outpatients. When arriving, a majority of patients go to the reception desk for check-in1. After check-in, the patient waits for her turn in front of consultation rooms. After doctor's consultation, she may need to take a lab test or to visit an examination room. After an examination she may need a second consultation Some patients may need another set of tests or need to receive a physical therapy. The payment at the reception desk is the last step before leaving the hospital. In some cases, after payment patients may need to visit the lab for blood test or receive physical therapy. Sometimes there exists an exception to the process. For example, a patient may receive an examination or a test before seeing a doctor. The hospital currently does not provide a reservation system, because most patients are senior citizens who are not familiar with an appointment system2 The simulation model is built using the Arena simulation software [7]. Through interviews, hospital visits, and the records stored in the database, we have collected information for simulation. For simulation modeling, such information as patient arrival 


modeling, such information as patient arrival distribution, transition pattern within the system, and the service time distribution of each server is needed The electronic healthcare management system keeps the records of service activities with timestamps, which denote the date and time of the occurrence of certain events. Ideally, the system should record the arrival time at waiting queues, the service starting time, and the service completion time at each process, from which the distribution of waiting time and service time for each process can be accurately derived  1 A small number of paitents skip the check-in process and go directly to physical therapy 2 Although not reported here, our simulation studies the impact of introducing a reservation system as well   Figure 1 ? Patient Flow Diagram  The hospital under study, however, keeps only a single record per process, either a timestamp that records the beginning of the process or a timestamp that marks the end. The patient arrival rate and transition rate can be easily calculated from such records, but calculating the service time is not trivial from such incomplete timestamp records. In this paper we propose a method for extracting the service time distribution from incomplete timestamp information The accuracy of the simulation model employing the proposed methods is demonstrated by comparing the operation behavior estimated by the simulation model and that obtained from actual hospital records  2. Computation of Service Time Distribution  In this section, we describe two methods for generating service time distribution from an incomplete set of timestamp records. The proposed methods are based on two assumptions. First, the service time does not depend on the time or day nor the length of waiting queue. Second, a server immediately serves the next patient when its queue is not empty  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 2.1. Busy Period Method  The first method for computing service time distribution is designed for busy periods. We assume that when any patient is waiting in a queue, the server takes no idle time and immediately serves the first patient in the queue. In busy periods when patients are waiting for servers, the difference between the timestamps of two consecutive service beginning records \(of two different patients reasonable estimate of the service time duration. With the same logic, the timestamp gap between two consecutive service departure records can be used as well Figure 2 depicts the service process flow from patient viewpoint. A patient waits at a queue for a certain server until she gets her turn \(at point A patient occupies the server during service time \(until point D point A \(i.e., service start i.e., service departure  G Figure 2 ? Service Process flow in busy periods  


 The way to compute the service time from service start-time records is shown in Equation \(1 2 3 denotes the service time for the patient t. Its denotes the server idle time until a new patient is served  1 2                               3    To use this method successfully, a key issue is the detection of a busy period. When identifying the busy period, we use the patient inter-departure time \(or patient inter-arrival time always are patients waiting for services such that the patient inter-departure time will have very little, if any idle time in it. His/her service time can be computed from inter-arrival time \(or inter-departure time server, as shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 shows an example of inter-departure time of the consultation process. From the graph, we identify the busiest duration to apply the proposed method. In this case, the timestamp samples from 10:30am to 11:30am can be used for service time computation. The abnormally high values between 12:30pm and 1:30pm in Figure 3 is due to lunch break  2.2. Idle Period Method  When server operation policy is complex and/or the patient arrival is sparse, the busy period method cannot be used to compute service time distribution. For example, in the hospital under study, three exam rooms, MRI, BMD and ultrasound are operated by two staffs. Based on the waiting queue length and other factors, two staffs switch to serve three exam rooms To deal with the fact that servers are often in the idle state and/or servers may have complex operation policy, we use a different method. This time, we trace each patient's movement and calculate the service time by using the timestamps of the patient generated by different servers. In comparison, The busy period method uses multiple patients' timestamps belonging to the target server   G G Figure 4 ? Service Process flow with idle periods  The first diagram in Figure 4 depicts the repeated waitings and services of a patient who follows his/her service sequence. When the number of patients being served is small, the availability of servers will be high and patients can move through the series of services without waiting. In such an idle period, the waiting time can be ignored and the service flow of a patient Figure 3 ? Inter-departure time of consultation process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 can be modeled as in the second diagram of Figure 4 We assume the time needed to move from one server to another is negligible, but the simulation model can incorporate any reasonable transfer time  4                              5   6                                     


                                     To compute the service time, the start and end time of service is needed. For the start time of a service at servers, we can use either the departure timestamp   a service, either the departure timestamp current server or the arrival timestamp next server can be used. Depending on the type of services, all or some of these timestamps are available The decision criterion of when to use the idle period method is as follows. We apply the idle period method to a patient when the gap between the departure timestamp of the patient and that of the previous patient \(who used the same server significantly larger than the current estimate of the service time of the server. In our simulation model, if the gap is 3 times larger than the  average service time the idle period method is applied to the corresponding patient. A similar decision criterion is used in case where the arrival timestamp is used A shortcoming of the idle period method is that the number of sample data tends to be small. A small sample size may result in less accurate estimation of the service time distribution. To increase the sample size, one needs to collect more data over a longer duration  3. Simulation Model  To build a simulation model, we have conducted a sequence of interviews. The number of staffs assigned for each process is described in Table 1. The number of consultation rooms under operation varies according to the time and day and doctors' surgery schedule. The expensive examination facilities are shared with the internal department. Three staffs operate the examination rooms, one dedicated to handle X-ray and the other two to operate remaining equipments In addition to the information obtained through interviews, we need information about patient arrival rates, transition rates, and service time. Such information is computed from the timestamp records accumulated in the hospital database. Note that for the check-in and payment processes, the timestamp is made when the process is completed. Similarly, for the consultation process, the timestamp is recorded at the end of doctor's consultation. By contrast, for X-Ray MRI, BMD and CT, the timestamp is logged when the staff retrieves patient-related information prior to examination. The timestamp for the physical therapy is created prior to the start of the service, similar to the examination processes First, we compute patient arrival rates. When arriving, the majority of patients start with the check-in process. However, a small number of patients may bypass check-in. For example, a patient who receives physical therapy regularly can directly go to the therapy room. Some regular patients may go consultation directly without check-in. Table 2 shows the average number of patients arriving to each process per day. Direct arrivals to all examination processes are combined, since very few patients go directly to examination rooms. The ratio among the processes is almost the same regardless of the time and day  Process Average number of patients Ratio Check-in 824.1705 95.17

The average number of patients per day  Figure 5 plots the outpatient's arrival rates based on the time and day. The arrival rate reaches its peak between 9am and 11am in the morning. A dip around noon depicts lunch break. All staffs except physical therapists take lunch break between 12:30pm and 1:30pm, while physical therapists take turns for their lunch break. On Saturdays, most outpatient services are closed in the afternoon except physical therapy Generally, Monday and Saturday mornings are the busiest, while Tuesday and Thursday afternoons are the least busy  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 Figure 5 ? Patient arrival rate  Second, we need to figure out how each patient moves inside the hospital. Using the timestamp created either at the beginning or at the end of each process we compute the transition rates between processes Table 3 summarizes the transition matrix. For example after doctor's consultation, 27.48% of the patients take X-rays. The transition rate is stable throughout the time and day. Using the arrival rates and the transition rates we can simulate patients arrival and movement in the hospital Third, we need to compute the service time of each process. The service time distribution is derived from the two methods described in Section 2. The estimated service time is presented in Table 4. For each process we note which of the two methods is used Figure 6 shows the simulation model. The model consists of three parts: the arrival logic, the lobby logic, and the processing logic. Each part models patient arrivals, patient movements, and waiting/service of various clinic processes. The arrival logic simulates the arrivals of orthopedics outpatients As shown in Figure 5, the arrival pattern depends on the time and day. The lobby logic simulates the patient movements by interconnecting the arrival logic and the process logic. The process logic simulates hospital services. The service processes modeled are check-in payment, consultation, X-Ray, MRI, CT, BMD, lab test, and physical therapy. Each process is modeled with corresponding service time distribution, server numbers, and operating policies. Each process occupies certain hospital resources, a room, a doctor, a nurse, etc., for the duration of the service and releases the resources when completed  Process Mean Variance Std.dev.

4. Accuracy of Simulation Model  The accuracy of our simulation model is evaluated by comparing the operation behaviour estimated by our simulation model and that obtained from the hospital operation trace data. Though the waiting time that patients experience will be the most desirable comparison metric, it is infeasible to extract actual waiting time data from the activity records of the hospital under study. Instead, we use the patient's arrival rate of each process as a comparison metric The patient's arrival rate of each process is determined by both the arrival of new patients and the movement of existing patients from their previous process.

Conclusion  This paper presents a simple yet effective method of computing the service time distribution from incomplete timestamp information. We applied the proposed method for a case study of a mid-size hospital, and obtained a reasonably accurate simulation model. We are currently pursuing several promising directions for enhancing the accuracy of simulation model. We are also utilizing the developed simulation model to analyze the impact of a reservation system to the hospital under study in a separate paper  6. References  1] Ronald E. Giachetti, Edwin A.

healthcare information systems, of which EMRs are a part, should provide researchers with new and diverse phenomena to be investigated.  We believe that this paper makes three contributions to EMR research First, we hope to improve understanding of EMR implementation by integrating findings from the ERP literature into EMR research. Second, we hope that by providing some theoretical background and propositions we can help EMR research move forward.  Third, we hope that collecting qualitative data provides some general support in the identification of success factors and a basis for developing more detailed empirical data collection  9.
