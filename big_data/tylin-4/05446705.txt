  1 Instrumental Systematic Errors in a Chromotomographic Hyperspectral Imaging System Randall L. Bostick, Glen P. Perram, and Ronald F. Tuttle Air Force Institute of Technology Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433 937\ 255-3636, ext. 7504 randall.bostick@afit.edu  Abstract 227Chromotomographic imaging \(CTI\s a method of convolving spatial and spectral information which can be reconstructed into a 3-D spat ial/spectral image cube using the same transforms employed in medical tomography.  The Air Force Institute of Technology \(AFIT\as built a chromotomographic imaging system which features a rotating prism to accomplish this convolution.  This paper will specifically address effects of systematic instrumental 
error in collected projection da ta and on the reconstructed hyperspectral image cube in terms of spatial location and resolution, spectral line shift and increased width of spectral peaks.  Systematic error cons idered are those associated with prism alignment, detector array position, and prism rotation angle The methods used to reconstruct hyperspectral data cubes require an approximation of the instrumentation which generates the forward transform.  Any variation between the estimate of these properties and their true performance results in a residual term in the reconstruction of a spectral bin, which is characterized as an error kernel in the transform equation.   A computer model will be used to explore the sensitivity of the kernel to various systematic 
errors.  Data is then collected with the instrument to assess the validity of the model under some representative conditions.  It is found that the shorter wavelength  500nm\prism has the highest spectral dispersion suffers mostly from degradation of spectral resolution in the presence of systematic error, while longer wavelengths 600nm\ffer mostly from a shift of the spectral peaks.  The model as well as collected data indicates that the quality of the reconstructed hyperspectral imagery is most sensitive to the misalignment of the prism rotation mount.  With less than 1\260 total angular error in the two axes of freedom, spectral resolution was degraded from 50%-100% in the blue spectral region.  For larger errors than this, spectral peaks begin to split into bimodal 
distributions, and spatial point response functions \(PRFs are reconstructed in rings with radius proportional to wavelength and thickness of the PRF 1,2  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  D ATA C OLLECTION AND P ROCESSING 4  3  S OURCES AND E FFECT OF I NSTRUMENTAL E RROR 5

 1  I NTRODUCTION  There is considerable potential for exploiting features captured by systems which pr oduce hyperspectral imagery HSI\haracterize fast tran sient events, such as bomb detonations, muzzle flashes, and other battlefield combustion events  Ho we ver   m o st l y du e t o  technological constraints, HSI has traditionally been used to monitor static or, at most, events with slowly changing \(> 1 minute\l and spectral features. Chromotomography has proposed advantages over imaging FTS and other conventional approaches, including: \(1\mple, inexpensive design with less sensitivity to vibration, \(2\easy integration with standard imaging sensors and technology, \(3\high throughput enabling lowered signal-to-noise \(SNR 
constraints, and \(4\e flexibility to capture panchromatic imagery and perform high-speed non-imaging spectroscopy with the same data collected to produce the 3-D spatial spectral image cubes.  AFIT has built a rotating prism CTI based on existing design [2,3 wh ich u s es a ro tatin g prism t o  test the utility of the technology and verify these assertions  The dependence of spectral and spatial resolution on instrument design and performance parameters is not well documented for CTI technology, and moreover the degradation of performance in the presence of instrumental error is also unknown.  Several sources of possible error in design are apparent, and common to any prism or other dispersive element spectroscopic instrument.  However because spectrally dispersed da 
ta is collected by the CTI instrument as the prism rotates, there is an additional degree of difficulty in the problem.  The final hyperspectral data cube must be mathematically constructed from many 2-D projections which results in a propagation of the error through a transform to reach the final HSI data to be exploited by a user  Several of the primary sources of systematic error will be examined in this study.  Thei r contribution to error in the final hyperspectral data cube will be measured in terms of spatial and spectral shift from the known location of a source and degradation of spatial and spectral and resolution with respect to system performance without the explicit

The sensitivity of the output in the 2-D projection and 3-D reconstructed data to variations in the error parameters above is examined using a model of the AFIT instrument Data is then taken using the instrument for select cases to verify the correctness of the model and sensitivity to changes in the parameters  Corrections can be made in the data reconstruction algorithms by performing a simple calibration to improve quality, although in other cases the resolution is due to instrumental design.  Until the full spectral/spatial/temporal functionality of the instrument is known, it is not clear that the CTI can perform well in this critical mission area, and to what degree error has on the data collection or how these errors propagate through the data transform   2  D ATA C OLLECTION AND P ROCESSING  A direct vision prism \(DVP\rves as the dispersive element to project the target or object, onto an array of detectors with some displacemen t of the image a function of its spectral components.  A third dimension is added by rotating the prism and collecting projections at the various angles of rotation.  This data can then be reconstructed mathematically to form the 3D hyperspectral imagery.  The design of the AFIT instrument is based on optimal performance given pre-existing components, but collection procedure and reconstruction are general to the technology Instrument Design The basic CTI design is shown schematically \(not to scale in Figure 1.  The system f eatures a two-element DVP with an undispersed wavelength of c 548nm, which is centered on and rotates about the optical axis.  The first optical material is SFL6, the second is LaSF N30 \(Schott Glass nomenclature\.

For simplicity, the x-y Cartesian axes defined at the detector array will also define the directions of the Cartesian coordinates at any plane in the instrument and p 0\260 defined at the point where dispersion is parallel to the x axis and dispersed wavelength increasing in the x  direction. Each sample at a p is referred to as a spectral projection denoted by P\(x,y p  Figures 3a-3d illustrate this concept with spatial sources emitting at distinct wavelengths, and projections taken at p 0\260, 90\260, and 180\260 If f\(x,y  represents the spectral and spatial intensity distribution in detector space of a source with some band limited then the projection P\(x,y p  can be expressed in terms of f\(x,y  as   3   We now take the Fourier transform \(with the frequency components x  y  xy ch side and make use of the shift property, giving  4 where where 2   xy p p ix y p Se 212\006\006 t 006\006 a b 004 005\004\005\004\005\004 004 004 002\b 004 004\004 005 212\007 212\007  2        xy ixy p xy P fxy e S dxdyd

This is analogous to projection radiography where a selected plane remains in focu s while all others are blurred by source and detector motion.  The analogy in CTI is the need for more projection angles as the data becomes more spatially and spectrally diverse with the number of projections necessary \(or optimal\nding on the spatial frequencies in the original f\(x,y  data, and the subsequent amount of blurring that the S i 267S j 1 cross term can impart Effect of Error on the Reconstructed Data Systematic errors in the CT instrument will be observed in the way that they contribute to the inaccuracy in the estimation of the shift imparted on energy of wavelength j  by the prism.  While the forward transform operator given in Eq. 5 is based on instrument performance, the inverse operator is derived from an estimate of this performance Because this estimate cannot be exact S 1   p  is not an exact inverse, and will not completely cancel in Eq. 8.  If x\222  p  and y\222  p  are the estimates of the true shifts   x  p  and  y  p  we will define H   p  as the product of S and S 1  so that  10  which can be expressed in the cylindrical coordinates as  11  with  12  In Eq. 9 r\222  p  is the estimate of the value of r  at each p not necessarily constant for each p hat leads to the values x\222  p  and y\222  p    This error kernel will go to essentially 1 as the estimate becomes perfect, with some second order error that is inherent to the instrument sampling properties not considered here, but shown to be negligible in previous work  The degradation in each spectr al bin can be represented by the spatial form of H   p  integrated over p h   As an example, Figure 4 shows a representative PSF in pixel space, centered at pixel x=16 y=16.  Figures 4b and 4e show the spatial patterns from example error functions h    4b with r a constant, and 4c with r  4*sin p 2 where p  is summed from 0\260-360\260 in discrete 1\260 increments. The results of carrying out the convolution of each with the PSF given in Figure 4 are shown in Figures 4c and 4f.  As would be expected, the post-convolu tion PSF is increased equally in all directions when the exponential term in H   p  is defined by a circle centered at the origin.  In the case of the error kernel represented in Figure 4b, the PSF is enlarged asymmetrically and shifted in space according to what amounts to be a spatial weighting function. The examples express the error in estimation of the term r\222  p  for a fixed as both a spatial broadening of the PSF and a spatial shift As multiple bins are reconstructed, the errors propagate their effects into the spectral domai n as peak broadening and spectral peak displacement.  The sources of error investigated in this paper w ill each contribute to inaccuracy in estimating system performance, thus  on the quality of the reconstructed data set in terms of how they modify the value of r  or p to arrive at r\222  p  and x\222  p  and y\222  p          nnn njp jp jp Rxy Px x y y   4 the 3-D R\(x,y  spectral image space.  The back-projection algorithm generally employs frequency filtering [5 suppress artifacts, and may in fact be designed to remove particular artifacts or recover targets given the affects of error induced blur.  Any particular filter will not be considered at this point, as we are attempting to demonstrate the unaltered effect of error in the reconstruction.  This essentially reduces the back-projection to a simple shift-andadd \(SAA\ method that is briefly described here  As indicated, the dispersion of the prism will linearly shift a point to some location on the detector array as a function of d 3  p   and p The SAA algorithm will attempt to reverse the shift and return the image to its proper spatial location in a given spectral bin j  at which it is emitting.  For a particular n th projection, the reconstruction of P\(x,y p n  is given by  6 This inverse shift applied to the projection data for a particular j is such that for a reconstructions R n all spatial structure emitting at j  are returned to their proper position in space, while all other j still are at some residual shifted location.  To complete the reconstruction of the spectral bin corresponding to j addition is necessary over all n to yield the spatial image R\(x i y i  j   7  Following the summation, all of the energy emitted at j  will have been coadded to properly build the image spatially in the R\(x,y j  bin, while the energy emitted at all other j  will be spatially shifted by some amount.  This is apparent by returning to the Fourier form where by applying the inverse shift S 1 for j and using Eqs. 4,5, and 6  1 1 1           N nn jjp jp j n fxy S S fxy N 004\004\005 004\005 004 212  t\006\006 t  8  indicates that for the spectral component j the image is recovered in the spectral bin.

These estimations in turn are derived primarily from three physical aspects of the instrument: the distance from L 3 to the detector array d 3 the angular dispersion of the prism p    and the rotation angle of the prism p These parameters are initially approximated by a model of the system or from the instrument specifications, and in practice there is almost always a difference between the model or design and the actual instrument.  There ar e two reasons for which an estimated d 3 222 from a specification may differ from the true value for d 3 The first is straightforward, as it is simply the inaccurate measurement of the distance between the third lens L 3 and the detector array.  The second is a result of misalignment of the detector array with respect to the optic axis, causing a variable d 3 across the array.  There are various sources for error in the estimated function p 222   Considered here are misalignment of the prism in the mount, misalignment of the prism mount, variation of field angle input to the prism f ace, and poor knowledge of p    itself.  Error in knowledge of p is straightforward as it is the difference between the proper angle of the DVP and that used for calculation in the SAA algorithm   The nature of the considered sy stematic errors are quantified by the degradation of the spatial and/or spectral resolution and change in the spatial and spectral location of the object with respect to its proper pos ition in hyperspectral space The degradation of the data is assessed by measuring the effect the error kernel has on reconstruction of a point source for varying amounts of systematic error. The modeled source is centered on a pixel at the center of the array and emitting at several discrete wavelengths.  A Gaussian function with a constant FWHM of 3 pixels depicts the point response of the system spatially at the detector array, and is assumed to be the spatial resolution Projections are created incorpor ating a particular systematic error, and reconstructions done assuming no error was present \(using instrument performance in Figure 2  The spatial and spectral resolutions are defined as the FWHM of Gaussian functions fitted to the data and expressed in pixels or nanometers.  The spectral and spatial location is defined as the center of the fit functions.  It has been demonstrated for the AF IT CTI instrument that, in presence of an error-free reconstruction, the spatial resolution in the reconstructed HSI cube is be the same as that measured in the 2-D projec  It was also shown that the spectral resolution is directly dependent on the spatial resolution and prism dispersion, and is shown in Figure 5 using the model input and instrument parameters   Figure 5 \226 The spectral resolution in the HSI data cube reconstructed from a spatial resolution defined by a Gaussian function with FWHM of 3 pixels  Error in Approximation of d 3 Distance to the Array The linear displacement at the detector array in terms of r   is defined by the geometry of the array with respect to the prism and the optical axis as shown on the left in the diagram of Figure 6, where the detector is assumed perpendicular to the optical axis.  If, however, an incorrect value for the distance is used, or there is some unknown tilt angle in the detector arra y, then the actual spectral displacement will be some r   p  The picture on the right in Figure 6  demonstrates this situation, with the focal plane tilted at an angle with respect to the optic axis, and an error in d 3 of d such that d 3 222 = d 3  d   For the arrangement in Figure 6 the spatial displacement on 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 Spectral Resolution \(nm nm  Figures 4a-f \226 Identical Gaussian PSFs in a and d are convolved with the example h    functions in b and e to illust rate the effect of instrumen tal error on the reconstruction X p i x e l s  Y \(pixels 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 30 15 20 25 15 20 25 30 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 15 20 25 30 15 20 25 30 15 20 25 30 15 20 25 30 15 20 25 30 15 20 25 30 15 20 25 30 15 20 25 30 15 20 25 15 20 25 30 a de bc f

Some trend in the spectral resolution is apparent, however very small compared to the ideal resolution of the system \(Figure 5 Error in Approximation of p  Prism Spectral Dispersion A basic and common reason for poor estimation of p   lies in the difference between the assumed performance of the prism given specifications or some model and the real performance of the prism as assembled  It is recommended that measurements be made to represent p 222  to best approximate the performance of the instrument.  However there may be situations where this is not possible \(e.g. a space borne application\or the measurement itself is flawed.  Thus, the estimate of the dispersion is the actual dispersion at a wavelength plus some error term    Inserting the term into Eq. 8 via Eq. 2, it can be shown that the error in estimation translates directly into a spectral shift with no loss of resolution or effect on the spatial properties as long as   is small with respect to p   Another way to approach this is to consider that for a wavelength j such that p  j  p 222 j   j  there is a k at which p  j  p 222 k   and it is at this k where the peak will be centered in the reconstructed data.

Given the known area of reconstruction on the focal plane, the appropriate p   f  can be used Prism Misalignment 227A requirement in the building of a CTI is that the front face of the prism be perpendicular to the optic axis so that parallel rays hit with a constant angle at all values of p If the prism is out of alignment, then this angle and thus I will vary as a function of p Consider the case illustrated by Fig. 15 where the prism is misaligned in the rotation stage.  Let the prism be placed in the mount such that at p 0\260, there is an angle of x between the normal to the face and the op tic axis \(see Figure 10b Then, by definition I  x At p 180\260, the prism orientation to the optic axis has shifted from x to 226 x but the direction of the dispersion has also reversed, resulting in I  x It follows that as the pris m rotates, the normal to its face rotates about the about the optical axis at angle x and thus I  x for all p it is assumed here that there is no random error, or that the pris m is not loose and changing orientation as it rotates in th e mount\  The prism may also have a tilt component y perpendicular to the x-axis. This angle will also be perpendicula r to the dispersive axis at p 0\260, thus have no effect on the dispersion angle 4 Thus the incident angle to the prism is completely described by Equation 14 for all p  prism I x 005\r     14 Figures 11a-d show the results of the error in reconstruction from different x both positive and negative.  As with the error in p   the constant error at all p causes a constant error in r   p  which is observed as a shift in peak wavelength with no other degradation of the data.  It should be pointed out that the shift in spectral peak recovers the spatial resolution, as the object is reconstructed to is proper spatial form but in a different bin.  The constant value of r   p  would produce a circular h   in the true bin of emission as shown in Fig. 4b.  Thus, if the instrument were used to look at the spatial co ntent in a bin corresponding to a known wavelength of emission the interpretation in the reconstructed data would be decreased spatial resolution  Also note that though it a ppears spectral and spatial resolution is actually improved with this systematic error the measurements are fairly random and in the noise of the Gaussian fit to the peaks  4 It is assumed that the prism faces ar e parallel in the plane perpendicular to the angled planes producing intended dispersion 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 0.01\260 0.05\260 0.10\260 Location \(nm nm 9 6 3 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 Error in r pixels nm I = +0.25\260 I = -0.25\260 I = +0.50\260 I = -0.50\260 I = +1.00\260 I = -1.00\260 


  8 Prism Mount Misalignment 227Now we consider the case of the misaligned rotation stage, which is similar to the situation with the misaligned prism.  Here, the prism is in perfect alignment, but the rotation stage is at some angle x  to the optic axis when I 0\260 as in Figure 12c so that at p 0\260 I  x But now, at p 180\260, the prism is still oriented to the optic ax is by the same angle x while the dispersion axis has reversed \(Figure 12d\ so that I x  The normal to the prism face is fixed with only the prism\222s dispersive axis d rotating with p This also implies that any y-component of mount tilt y will contribute to I  with I  y at p 90\260 and  I y at p 270\260.  The expression for I in the presence of mount mi salignment in two dimensions becomes  15  Figures 13a-d provide the assessm ent of error effects on the reconstructed data for different combinations of angles x  and y Now, with I varying as a function of p there is a loss of spectral and spa tial resolution as well as displacement of the source spect rally and spatially.  In all cases, performance is degraded as both the sum of the angles increase, but also, an d more dramatically, as the difference between x and y increases.  This is apparent when looking at the curves with x 0.25\260 y 0.0\260  x 0.5\260 y 0.0\260\ versus the curves x 0.25\260 y 0.0\260  and  x 0.25\260 y 0.25\260\ugh in bo th cases the increase is 0.25\260 in total angle, the more asymmetric change is more significant.  Also p eculiar in the data is the trend to better performance at lower wavelength s for the worse cases.  This is due to the peaks becoming so spectrally and spatially deformed, the measurement of resolution in terms of the  FWHM of a Gaussian peak becomes meaningless.

30 10 10 1000   10 The spatial distribution of the 400 nm source offers some interpretation of the spectral peak shape.  Frames are selected at 3 wavelength bins for the x 0.5\260 y 0.5\260 and presented in Figures 15a-c Figure 15a is the spatial plane corresponding to the first maximum in the 400nm peak located at 399.1nm, Figure 15b the minimum at 400 nm, and Figure 15c is the second maximum at 400.8nm Three things become apparent here: 1\ there is a dim \223ring\224 at the wavelengths which show the highest spectral energy with a core density of energy 2\nergy concentration is greatest at the spectral mini ma, though in a \223donut\224 shape indicating the FWHM still not well represented and thus the apparent increase in resoluti on in the 400nm result; 3\he core of the spatial distribution is at the center, undisplaced location in the chip, while the center of the donut in Fig. 15b is off center.  From these images, the shape of the h    function produced by the r   p  using the I  from Equation 12 in the model is apparent Field Angle Variation 227In the case of misalignment I  varies due to the changing orientation of the prism as it rotates, with the incident rays still parallel to the optic axis The effect was studied for th e case where the object is a point located exactly in the center of the FOV As this is an imaging spectrometer, we must consider extended objects and points at all locations in the FOV of the instrument While this is not strictly an er ror in instrumentation, as it is performing exactly as designed, it necessitates a change in the SAA algorithm to correction for I given the area of interest being constructed. Th is becomes more complicated if the entire FOV is chosen to be analyzed, and at a first cut a user may choose to perform reconstruction of the entire FOV with the assumption of a 0\260 field angle. While a complete assessment of the infl uence of field angle will not be presented here, this assessment of degradation at off axis points can be made by considering this affect to be similar to the mount misalignm ent situation.  In looking at Figure 12, instead of an angle induced by the tilt in the mount with respect to an incoming ray, the incoming ray can be considered at an angle  F Thus, the result is similar to those seen in the previous section.  The AFIT CTI was designed with this situation in mind, w ith slower optics to limit the change in F as a function of field position with maximum F at the edge of the FOV at 0.65\260 Summary of p  Estimation 227With three factors identified that cause variation in the incident angle to the prism, we now return to the centr al issue of estimating p   I  which is driving the error in recons truction.

The shift imparted by the instrument is not only described this magnitude of displacement as a function of  but also by the azimuthal dir ection defined by prism angle p This relationship is a direct result of Equations 1a and 1b, so that if in the process of reconstruction the projection angle is taken to be some p 222   p it reduces the accuracy of the estimation of x\222 and y 222 used Equation 10.  If p  represents the residual between p 222  and  p then the estimated shift terms are  18a 18b  In the reconstruction, this is observed as a convolution of the original PSF by a ring of radius r p   in each spectral bin, with no loss of spectral reso lution, or shift in spatial or spectral location.  This does imply, that, unlike the case of error in p   there is no wavelength at which there is a recovered spatial di stribution.  The ch ange in spatial resolution for given values of p are shown in Figure 16  Figure 15a-c \226 The spatial representa tion of the 400 nm peak with x  y 0.5\260 in three spectral bins corresponding to the first maximum at about 399nm, the minimum at 400nm, and the second maximum at 401nm 


  11  Figure 16 \226 The loss of spat ial resolution for errors in p    The spatial distribution of th e reconstructed images is illustrated in Figure 17 for p 0.5\260 and 400nm, 425nm and 450nm As expected, the larger dispersion at the shorter wavelengths will cause a larger shif t error.  In fact, as shown in Fig. 17 the error radius can become so large that we again see donuts as point response functions in the reconstruction Final Comments Specific systematic sources of error have been presented in this section independently Obviously it is a combination these errors that will propaga te through the transform to give the final result in terms of resolution and displacement in the reconstructed hyperspectral data set.  The contribution of each systematic error source in terms of the derived r   p  or  x\222 y\222 representation can be used to create an error kernel for each given in Equations 10 and 11 multiplied in series in Fourier space or convolved in series in the spatial domain to evaluate the cumulative effect  3  C OMPARISON TO M EASUREMENTS  The effect and sensitivity of th e selected systematic errors have been shown given the mathematical models for projection and reconstruction.  Data taken from the AFIT CTI instrument will be examined to determine how well the model is capturing the modeled impact of the systematic error with controlled in strumental inaccuracies Data Collection and Analysis An effective point source will be the target for the system and is represented by a 300 m pinhole at the object plane illuminated by a combination of an Hg pen lamp and red laser pointer.  This provid es 5 clear lines at 404.7nm 435.8nm, 546nm, 577.5nm, and 635nm 5 with the first four being from the pen lamp.   Care is taken here to not suggest that this is a true validation of the model, as it is impossible to completely isolate the effect of a single source of error Furthermore, the instrument was not designed with the exact measurement of quan tities such as detector tilt or prism alignment in mind, so these qu antities have to be measured indirectly. An attempt is made to make the particular error in question gross enough to be the overwhelming contributor and variation du e to possible inaccuracy in measurement is included in the model For each instance of induced systematic error in the instrument, projections will be taken at p 0\260-345 1 5 260 increments to provide a total of 23 projections.  This data will not be reconstructed usin g the SAA algorithm as that will serve to compound the contribution of unaccounted error.  Instead, a direct comparison to the derived r   p  will be made in each case.  In assessing the model vs performance, trends in this da ta will be consid ered in favor of absolute difference.  The measurements made address effect of detector tilt and di stance error, accuracy of the dependence of p   on I and error from prism misalignment.  For the this co llected data, a correction will be made to better calibrate the system to the actual p   to avoid the spectral shift in the data Variation in Detector Array Tilt and Distance To measure the affect that til t has on the collected data, the PIMAX camera was slightly ro tated from its position to create an angle between the detector array and the normal to the optical axis as shown in Figure 6.  Because the camera was rotated about its mount point, which is displaced from detector by 70 mm, the rotation angle also  5 The 577.5 line is the average of the Hg doublet that appears here and not clearly resolved by the instrument nm Spatial Res. \(pixels 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 p = 0.10\260 p = 0.25\260 p = 0.50\260  Figure 17 \226 The 400 nm, 425 nm, and 450 nm spatial functions for p 0.5\260.

Swiveling the camera also rotates the array away from th e image plane, so there is a hard limit on the  that can be imparted before the spectrum is off of the array  The camera is turned 4\260 in the +x-direction x 4\260\nd tilted upward y 2\260\.  The camera was moved toward L 3  by 2mm d 2mm corporating the variable distance imparted by the camera sw ivel.  It is estimated that the tilt angle of the camera can be measured to +/- 0.25\260 and that the error in from both components\within 0.5mm.  These measurement er ror estimations will be used in the model to determine a maximum and minimum range of model results.  Equation 13 will be used to calculate r   p  the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle.  For the 404.7nm source, the image was projected off of the array at p 140\260 - 200\260 thus the gap in data.  The results are shown in Figs. 18-22   Figure 18 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 404.7nm spectral line   Figure 19\226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 435.8nm spectral line   Figure 20 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 546nm spectral line   Figure 21 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 577.5nm spectral line   Figure 22 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 635nm spectral line   The data imply that the overall mean value of r   p  is being captured which represents the contribution of The shapes of the curves appear to match somewhat for the 404nm and 435nm cases, but the correlation for the other three wavelengths is not as cl ose.  For these wavelengths the variation in r   p  as a function of p is very small possibly due to other uncontrolled error.  Also, for these and all spatial location measurements, there is inherent quantization error in determinin g the center of the Gaussian fit function due to the phasing of the samples on the array 6  Change in p  as a Function of I  A major impact on the reconstr uction algorithm is the error in estimation of the prism dispersion angle p   due to the difference in assumed and true values of the incident angle to the prism I This drives the observed error as a result of prism misalignment, as well as the correction needed in the reconstruction to account for fiel d angle.

The 404.7nm source shows the most variation  Figure 23 \226 The difference in pixel displacement at the detector array between measurements from modeled and collected data as a function of I     Figure 24 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 404.7nm spectral line   Figure 25 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 435.8nm spectral line   Figure 26 \226 Measured and modeled r   p or the 546nm spectral line   Figure 27 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 577.5nm spectral line   Figure 28 \226 Measured and modeled r   p  for the 635nm spectral line   Given that the model is able to predict the displacement of energy as a result of an error in p   due to incident angle data was collected similar to that with the tilted camera to examine the effect system atic error due to unknown I  caused by a misaligned prism Here, the prism was angled in the mount in two directions to create the angles x and y  between the prism face and the normal to the optical axis as shown in Fig. 10.  The mo unt itself was tilted in two directions to create the misalignment angles x and y as shown in Fig. 12.  The magnitudes of these angles were measured by a laser as described above.  The aperture was placed such that each mm of separation at the aperture equates to 0.25\260 of angle at th e prism.  Misalignment in the instrument was used that gave values x  0.5\260 y  0.5\260 x 0.75\260 and y  0.5\260 with the instrument design again limiting the amount of error that could be imparted  The r   p  expression from Equation 17 will be compared to see how the displacement of each of the 5 wavelengths as a function of rotation angle varies given the different I  due to misalignment as the prism rotates.

  14 error for angles and is +/-0.2\260 and is incorporated into the model prediction.  Results are shown in Figures 24-29  Here, the measured data match the overall trends of the model very well, with some slight offset of about 2 pixels in each of the r   p  comparisons.  This would lead to the assumption that the estimate of x is not accurate, but is likely not the case since the mean of the model is too high in the 404nm data, and too low in the 435nm data.  This indicates that there are other errors being observed, as again it is nearly impossible to lim it the measurement to error in the intended so urce.  Also, note the decrease in impact the rotation error has as wavelength increases.  This is due to the lowered bearing P has on p as shown in the previous section.  However, the error magnitudes are a ratio of the distance from the undeviated wavelength, and in this data set are large due the large fractional error of and   4  R ESULTS  The systematic errors in a CTI instrument affect the spectral and spatial resolutions and locations in the reconstructed hyperspectral data cube in similar ways that these errors would affect the results of a traditional prism spectrograph This would be expected since the 3-D data is constructed from 2-D projection data.  The CTI becomes much more sensitive to error dependent on how the error kernel in the reconstruction behaves as a function of the prism rotation angle p and degree of freedom not in a fixed element dispersion system.  Four type s of systematic error were examined in this study; those due to tilt in the detector array  between the det ector array and the lens L 3  d   error in knowledge of the angular prism dispersion p    and error in estimation of the prism rotation angle p   s that can be inse rted into the error kernel functions were developed for each to model the effects For reasonably large array tilts of up to 3\260 and error in distance of up to 2mm, only a slightly noticeable shift of less than a pixel in spatial location was observed, mostly dependent on the tilt angle.  A more substantial spectral peak shift resulted which was due to error in distance, with a 7nm shift seen at the longer wavelengths at d  2mm.  The spatial and spectral resolu tions remained virtually unchanged, indicating that an accurate construction occurs in a shifted location The dispersion angle can be in error due to faulty estimation of prism performance.  This w ill cause an apparent shift of spectral peaks as shown in Figu re 8.  A more complicated  is the result of its dependence on the incident angle to the prism face I This is caused by mi salignment of the prism in the mount, or misalignment of the mount itself.  Mount misalignment is similar to cons tant error in estimation of p   with a shift in spectral p eaks observed.  For the AFIT CTI, this shift is only a few nm per 1\260 of misalignment Mount misalignment produces a more complex error kernel as shift and loss of resolutio n occur for relatively smaller angular errors.  More impor tantly, the spectral peaks become split into two peaks for errors of total misalignment in both the x and y directions of 1\260.  The spectral resolution may be recovered if the entire spatial area of the image is integrated.  However, simila r to splitting of peaks, the spatial distribution is a donut shape in the bin of emission  Finally, the error in projection angle p was examined though in a more obligatory fa shion since it is a relative error \(i.e. not a systematic erro r necessarily, but an error in choice of the reference coordinate system\.  There is no shifting of spectral peaks or lo ss of spectral resolution however there is a circular displacement of the spatial image again causing donut shap es for large enough   Most importantly, the error mode l was verified by collecting measured data from the AFIT CTI instrument with systematic error intentionally created in the instrument to assess the effect.  While in some cases it was apparent that sources of error other than those being investigated were influencing the results, the data did match the model for the situations where th e studied error effect was dominant usually at higher angular dispersi on, or spectral resolution Further investigation of some error may be necessary, as our CTI system design could only support a certain degree of component alteration to assess er ror.  In some cases, due to sampling of the detector array w ith respect to the size of the PSF of the system, slight changes in performance caused by error could not be resolved  4  C ONCLUSIONS  The purpose of this study wa s to assess the effect of systematic error on the reconstr ucted data sets collected by a rotating prism CTI instrument While the results are specific to the AFIT CTI desi gn, it is intended that the relative magnitude of each error and result on the reconstructed data will apply to any set of data given the general nature of the equations describing the reconstruction and error kernel that is con volved with each spectral bin  The consequence of each systematic error was quantified by the shift in spectral and/or spatial location, and degradation of spectral and/or spatial reso lution.  Table 2 summarizes the contribution of each analy zed error to these quantities   Table 2 \226The effect of systematic error.  An \223x\224 indicates an effect exists, a \223-\223 indicates no effect is observed   


  15 The model of the system allows for a quick assessment of the error, and provides a more illustrative demonstration of the prism misalignment error an d how each spectral peak is affected differently.  Figure 29 shows how the spectral peak changes as the prism mount alignment is increased in both the x and y directions for the 400nm and the 450nm spectral peaks   Figure 29 \226 The 400nm and 450nm peak shapes with varying misalignment of the prism mount   Similarly, Figure 30 represents the situation where the prism mount misalignment is constant at x  y 0.5\260 but the misalignment of the prism in the mount is changing so that a constant shape is produced, but shifted as x increases   Figure 30\226 Shifting of the 400nm spectral peak as x  increases.  The shape remains the same as the misalignment of the mount is constant   Though presented independently, the obvious contribution of the errors of the system are cumulative and must be considered in total.  Given th e great number of variations possible, this was not attempted here, but can be done based on the mathematics  This study is intended to explore the effect of systematic error for the purpose of examining sensitivity of performance when designing th e instrument.  In practice the reconstruction of collected data is done using after calibration of the instrument to directly measure r  p   without regard for the sources of error.  While this measurement can be a diagnostic of the instrument, the fact that it is well known is enough to perform acceptable reconstructions.  If instrume nt components are accessible the diagnostics be used to correct for second order error created in the instrument.  For example, errors in distance to the focal plane or tilt also result in a defocus error which cannot be easily recovered in the reconstruction algorithm R EFERENCES  1  C G r o s s, G  P.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
