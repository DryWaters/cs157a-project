Communication and Leadership Trustworthiness in Virtual Teams An Empirical Comparison of the US and China   Jakob J. Assmann Institute for Information Organization & Management LMU Munich assmann@lmu.de Julia V. Gallenkamp Institute for Information Organization & Management LMU Munich gallenkamp@bwl.lmu.de   Abstract  This paper examines the influence of culture, self 
disclosure and communication media on perceptions of trustworthiness of the leadership of a virtual team using a massively multiplayer online game \(MMOG We obtained data from two main sources: a survey sent to the virtual team members in the US and China and archival data from the log-files of the MMOG. Based on a unique data set of 2245 participants from 319 virtual teams, this study shows that perceptions of leadership trustworthiness are affected by culture, high self-disclosure and intensive use of communication media. Furthermore, we posited and found that the relationship between two dimensions of self-disclosure 
and trustworthiness as well as the usage of synchronous or asynchronous communication media and trustworthiness is moderated by culture. Our study sheds light on the influence of computer-mediated communication on team leadership trustworthiness in virtual team environments and the moderating role of culture   1. Introduction  Virtual teams in which members are geographically dispersed and coordinate their work predominantly with electronic information and communication technologies \(ICT\, have become an important work 
group structure in virtual and traditional organizations 24, 37 o s t org an izations today e m plo y  v i rt u a l  teams to some degree [21, 25  One key characteristic of virtual structures is the reliance on ICT, which also functions as a driver of the push toward dispersion of virtual structures. The very benefits of ICT -- enabling teams to be distributed in space and time, functionally and culturally diverse more flexible and more autonomous -- result in greater challenges to coordination and cooperation within the team t h e tea m leaders h ip m u s t adapt 
to the new emerging work contex  The use and impact of ICT is strongly influenced by national cultur t, th ere is a pa u c it y of research in exploring these cultural differences in virtual teams. However, before examining global virtual teams, these differences should be comparatively explored on a national level. Therefore this study focuses on two very distinct countries, the US and China, to investigate the influence of national culture on the relationship between the use of ICT and trust. More precisely we focus on the influence of self 
disclosure in computer-mediated communication \(i.e the breadth and depth of the communication\ and the communication medium \(i.e. synchronous and asynchronous\ on the perceptions of trustworthiness of the team leadership. By leadership we refer to either one leader or a group of leaders that build the leadership team  2. Theoretical foundations  2.1. Trust in leadership  Scholars have emphasized the importance of trust in leadership for decades d es tabli s h ed its s t rong relationship to work attitudes, followed by most of the 
organizational citizenship behaviors, and finally job performan er s o m e s t u d ies poin t out that employees perceptions that leaders have attributes that promote trust may be important for leader effectiveness [e.g res e arch in dicate s th a t  effective team leadership is a main contributor to organizational team success s t in t h e tea m  leader is especially critical [16, 23, 31, 46 T h eref ore  trust in leadership has been identified as one of the most important success factors for the initiative

richness and synchronicity and, hence, opportunity to build social bonds, might enable trust McKnig u e that tru s t i s a n inten tio n of willingness to depend on another party that is preceded by trustworthiness beliefs, i.e. the leader s ability, integrity and benevolence, which help build the foundation for the development of trus   Scholars agree that trustworthiness is a multifaceted construct that captures both the character and the competence of the trustee [11, 34 T h e abilit y  dimension of trustworthiness identifies the competence, expertise, and capability, which enable the leader to fulfill certain tasks [39, 40 T h e a b ilit y of  a leader, however, does not say anything about his or her predictability in other aspects of his or her interactions with team members, such as their personal commitment to keeping promises or their benevolent intentions. Despite professional reliability and discretion, competent leaders may engage in unforeseeable acts, be dishonest, or disloyal. The integrity dimension of trustworthiness stems from perceptions that the leader or the leadership adheres to a set of principles that the team members find acceptable [40 d is s een as f a ir an d con s i s te n t 11  The benevolence dimension of trustworthiness refers to signals of cooperation, reciprocity, and loyalty [20, 39  e v o len ce is a l s o conv e y ed w h e n t h e leader is  able to correctly and fully anticipate the team members needs, and is willing to accommodate them 54 In this study we focus on perceived leadership trustworthiness for the following reasons: First, a recent meta-analysis by Colquitt et al. [14 sh o w ed o n  the one hand that all three dimensions of trustworthiness have a unique, significant relationship with trust and on the other hand that ability benevolence, integrity had significant, unique relationships with behavioral outcomes even when trust was considered simultaneously. Second, trust may be influenced by factors beyond the leader, as in models of institutional trust [51 w h ereas th i s st u d y is  focused on how interactions between team members and the team leadership affect perceptions of the leader. Third, Bran u e th at  trustworthiness is especially suitable for capturing trust in emergent relationships, where initial trusting beliefs are important and immediate causes of early trusting intentions  A significant and open question concerns the factors that contribute to perceptions and attributions of trustworthiness of leaders of virtual teams [12 T h is study focuses on the trustworthiness of the virtual leadership as the foundation of trust, since despite the noted importance of trust in the leader there is a paucity of virtual team leadership research   2.2. Culture and trust  National culture impacts the trust-building process because this process strongly depends upon the societal norms and values that guide people's behavior and beliefs t h is st u d y t h e cu lt u r e of t h e participants  is defined by their nationality. Theories of why people from one country are more trusting than those from another country come from many sources across a wide range of academic disciplines. These studies present numerous explanations for differing levels of trust across countries, including type of culture or religion, ease of two-way communication within the country, presence of monitoring or sanctioning mechanisms and degree and type of associativeness   Implications  of  these  theories  are  far  from  conclusive  because  they  provide  multiple  contradictory  predictions  regarding  which  country  is  the  most  trusting  and  trustworthy [9   Considering the virtual context of this study there is also evidence that in mediated communication traditional theories might be shifted due to greater reliance on face-to-face communication of some countries compared to others 30, 58, 69 acco rdan ce w i th Bu c h an et al. [10] an d due to the inconsistent theories of national differences in trust and the virtual context of our study, we hypothesize the following H1: Perceived trustworthiness of the leadership of virtual teams will vary across the two countries studied   2.3. Communication and trust  One important factor of influence on trust is communication. Frequent communication increases the amount of information that is available to estimate the other s abilities, intentions, and behaviors within a relationship. It also gives people the opportunity to develop a shared vision and language and by this way to increase trust in the other´s competence. Existing research supports the link between communication frequency and trust [41, 3, 27, 30 addition to frequency of communication, open communication, in which managers exchange thoughts and ideas freely with employees in a two-way communication, is shown to enhance perceptions of trust toward the  t h e range of  topics breadth  d  the revealing of personal information \(depth\which are dimensions of self-disclosure, reduce uncertainty and are crucial to social bonding, which leads to trust  ccordin g to in terp e rson al t h eories, sel f disclosure is a type of communication through which individuals make themselves known to other people break through the outgroup barrier and personalize Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 
 


themselv ti m a c y and relation a l dev e lopm e n t  are fostered by reciprocately sharing information  Therefore, self-disclosure and responding to selfdisclosures lead to relationships and trust simultaneously o th e m o re open th e tea m  communicates with its leadership and therefore establishes closer relationships, the more team members should trust in the team leadership. In computer-mediated communication self-disclosure is said to be even higher than in face-to-face encounters since little or no risk in revealing information is perceived due to a lack of physical presen Therefore, we hypothesize the following H2a: The range of topics \(breadth\ discussed with the leadership of virtual teams is positively related to the perceived trustworthiness of the leadership  H2b  The amount of personal information \(depth revealed to the leadership of virtual teams is positively related to the perceived trustworthiness of the leadership Culture may indirectly encourage trusting behavior through the structuring of general patterns of communication e s earch h a s i n dicated th at a  greater depth of self-disclosure is associated with nonWestern origins. In contrast, greater amounts of selfdisclosure, breadth, are identified with Americans Accounting for national culture, we hypothesize  H3a: Culture moderates the relationship between the range of topics \(breadth\ discussed and leadership trustworthiness such that Americans perceive the leadership as more trustworthy if discussing a wide range of topics with their leadership than Chinese H3b: Culture moderates the relationship between the amount of personal information \(depth\ revealed and leadership trustworthiness such that Chinese perceive the leadership as more trustworthy if revealing personal information to their leadership than Americans In addition to the effect of self-disclosure on trust we investigated the effect of the communication media used. When it comes to the influence of the communication media there are various theories that are used to explain the effects of the different kind of media used. Theories like the reduces social cues approach [35 e th eor y of  th e s o cial pres e n c e [55 the media-richness theory e m e dia synchronicity theory e r to com p u t er m ediated  communication as inferior to face-to-face communication. These theories categorize media that offer multiple channels such as visual or vocal cues and high immediateness of feedback as richer than media that does not. The supposed relationship, richer synchronous media promotes higher social presence and thus leads to more positive outcome than less rich media, has been shown various time  Nevertheless, some studies found less rich media as more effective en if  e m pirical s t u d ies on t h e influence of communication media on trust cooperation and performance are not consistent, there is an overall agreement that computer-mediated communication is superior to no communication situations. Distinguishing between synchronous and asynchronous communication media, we hypothesize the following H4a: Use of synchronous communication media for communicating with the leadership of virtual teams is positively related to the perceived trustworthiness of the leadership  H4b: Use of asynchronous communication media for communicating with the leadership of virtual teams is positively related to the perceived trustworthiness of the leadership Culture is a boundary condition for all interpersonal communication f e cts th e w a y i n di v i du al s  communicate because individuals generally behave according to culturally incorporated norms, rules, and values. Chinese participants may prefer technologies that are richer and allow for more real-time interaction i.e., synchronous technologies\ since they rely more on face-to-face communication than American participants to accomplish team tasks  Conversely, Americans may be comfortable with the division of labor and the parallel conduct of wo  Therefore we hypothesize  H5a: Culture moderates the relationship between the use of synchronous communication media and leadership trustworthiness such that Chinese perceive the leadership as more trustworthy if using richer and real-time communication media in communicating with their leadership than Americans H5b: Culture moderates the relationship between the use of asynchronous communication media and leadership trustworthiness such that Americans perceive the leadership as more trustworthy if using delayed communication media in communicating with their leadership than Chinese   3. Method  3.1. The Online Game Context  The study of virtual teams poses significant challenges. On one hand, field studies of virtual teams are typically small in scale and often lack quantitative or objective data [e.g t h e ot h e r h a n d  laboratory studies, while allowing for large scale rigorous quantitative data collecting, involve relatively short-lived simulations in which the participants have Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3

The research model  little psychological investment [e.g In th is s t u d y   an alternative setting of a Massively Multiplayer Online Game \(MMOG\ which people interact in a realistic manner over an extended period of time in a virtual world is employed  Although laboratory simulations allow for similar sorts of data collection this context has several advantages over such an approach. These games tend to be highly engaging and psychologically meaningful to participants [64, 65   Often the relationship between players is compared to the relationship between co-workers in their real job  t h e w o rk t h at i s bei n g p e rf or m e d i n  v i deo g a m e s is increasingly similar to the work performed in business corporations ecen t s t u d ies i n dicate t h at  MMOGs could function as leadership s online labs providing a glimpse what team leadership might look like in the futu Moreov er, MMOGs allo w  researchers to create data sets with large sample sizes multisource quantitative data, and good unobtrusive measurements In this study, we use a popular browser-based MMOG. The game itself is a real-time strategy game RTS\layers start out as chieftains of their own villages and seek to gain natural resources, build armies and expand their realms. The game is timed to last approximately one year, at which one entity being deemed the winner based on the fastest completion of a certain building called wonder of the world Playing with up to 20,000 users on one server with scarce resources and only one player or team being able to win, players soon find themselves in a social dilemma  T h ey  h a v e  to cooperat e  w i th ot h e r pla y ers to  protect their territory and resources and to successfully expand their reach. In the race to dominate, players form teams of up to 60 members under a leading chieftain or chieftains. However, teams are not randomly formed but mutually selected. Players can either found their own team, apply for a membership in an existing team or are recruited by an existing team, a process quite similar to the team selection processes within regular companies. Hereby, team leaders emerge either because they are the founders of the team or because the team members elect them Recruiting, assessing, motivating, rewarding, retaining talented team members, and analyzing often incomplete data in order to make immediate decisions that have wide-ranging effects are only few of the tasks performed by the team leadersh T e am w o rk   diplomacy and negotiation skills play a crucial role in this context leading to complex team structures and interactions between teams  3.2. Sample and Procedure  The sample comprised 2245 participants in 319 teams. An approach was used that analyzes data obtained from two sources: archival data from the log files taken directly from the online game servers and a questionnaire administered to subscribed players in virtual teams Several sampling criteria were employed. First, this study focused on two game servers that were running for a sufficient amount of time, namely 279 days for the US server and 251 days for the Chinese server allowing for teams to establish. Second, this study restricted the sample to players who were part of a team, rather than playing alone. Third, the focus was on players who were part of a team with at least 3 team members and a team leader because teams with less than three members were not viable, since the team leader does not play a prominent role in these teams Fourth, we focused on team members without any leadership responsibilities within the team. Using these criteria, 397 teams with 6781 members were identified in the US and 318 teams with 7900 members were identified in China As noted earlier, this study believes that online gaming provides an excellent context in which to study virtual teams because research suggests at  individuals become highly engaged and psychologically invested in online games. To ensure that players were tapped who displayed a reasonable level of engagement in the task a link was posted to the survey on the log-in page of the game for a relatively brief period of time three days in Mai 2008. In this way, casual players who do not log onto the game regularly were less likely to be part of the sample. 3761 players started the survey in the US and 2874 players in China. Therefore, the initial US response rate was 56% and the initial Chinese response rate was 34 However, the response rate can be assumed to be higher since not all 14681 players logged in during the survey window. From this sample only the fully completed surveys from teams were kept where at least Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 
 


three team members had responded. This reduced the number of observations to 1347 participants allocated in 165 teams in the US and 898 participants allocated in 154 teams in China To verify that the sample contained the better performing and therefore more engaged players and teams, the non-responding 232 US teams as well as the non-responding 164 Chinese teams were compared to the sample of this study using performance data and team size data from the log-files. As anticipated, the teams in the sample were significantly better performing, \(m sample, US 66903, SD US 136946; m nonrespondents US 1980, SD US 2672; t US 6; m sample, CN  135142, SD CN 90535; m non-respondents, CN 39588 SD CN 45287; t CN 12\er \(m sample, US 30 SD US 14; m non-respondents, US 8, SD US 5; t US 19 m sample, CN 39, SD CN 14; m non-respondents, CN 12, SD CN  8; t CN 21\an the non-respondents. These findings suggest that the sample excluded the less engaged causal players, who end up in smaller, poorer performing teams The average age of the players was 28 years ranging from 12 years to 70 years in the US and 26 years, ranging from 11 years to 60 years in China; 26 of the sample was female in the US and 11% in China The average team size was 30 players ranging from 6 to 60 players in the US and 39 players ranging from 6 to 60 players in China. The average number of respondents per team was 8, ranging from 3 to 23 in the US and 6, ranging from 3 to 13 in China Equivalence   In cross-national research, it is important to establish that the constructs, samples, and measures used are equivalent prior to testing comparative hypotheses ed th e approach  discussed by Bensaou et al s u re al l t h ree types of equivalence: construct equivalence, sampling equivalence, and measure equivalence. All measures used were translated from English into Chinese and back-translated from Chinese into English by Chinese native speakers with strong English skills. A third Chinese native speaker compared both versions and made final adjustments  3.3. Measures  Dependent Variable  Ratings of the three dimensions of leader trustworthiness, ability \(six items\tegrity \(six items\ and benevolence \(five items\ere obtained from team members. For the present study, the items were derived from Mayer and Davis d altered s lightl y to ref l ect t h e v i rtu a l  context. Each dimension had acceptable reliabilities with Cronbach s 95, .87, and .89 respectively Independent Variables  Data on culture communication breadth and depth as well as the use of communication medium were obtained from the team members survey Culture was measured by asking each team member which nationality he or she belongs to. Players had the possibility to choose either the US US=1 other in the US version and China China=2 other in the Chinese version C ommunication breadth and depth was measured by using five items for depth and three items for breadth derived from Parks and Floyd [4 d a d apted to th e  online game context. Both measures showed acceptable reliabilities with Cronbach s 68 and 70 Synchronous communication was measured asking each member to what extent he or she is using the ingame chat program to communicate with the alliance leadership Asynchronous communication was measured asking each member to what extent he or she is using email, the forum, and the in-game messaging program to communicate with the alliance leadership Control Variables  On a team level, this study controlled for team size i.e., the number of players in the team\which was obtained directly from the game archives and team performance which was measured by the in-game scoring system. On the individual level we controlled for age, gender, experience with the game, team members propensity to trust, and tenure in the team, which were all obtained from the team member survey Age was measured in years and Gender was measured with two categories \(male=1 female=2 Experience with the game and team member tenure were measured in months Propensity to trust of the team members was measured in eight items ron bach s was .68  3.4. Analyses  Because data were nested, i.e. team members interacted with the same leadership and therefore individuals were nested within teams, there was the potential for dependence in the data. The hypotheses involve predictors measured at two levels of analysis the team \(i.e., culture\d the individual level \(i.e team member s communication content and medium We ran a set of null models  with no predictors for each dimension of trustworthiness. Resulting ICC\(1\alues reflecting the percentage of variance residing between groups indicated the multi-level nature of the data Therefore, a hierarchical linear modelling \(HLM analysis was appropriate. Using a two-level approach this statistical technique provides for an examination of relationships across multiple levels of analysis by taking this nonindependence inherent within nested data into account, incorporating simultaneously partitioning and modelling within-group and betweengroup varian ll pred ictors  w e re s t an dardized prior to hypotheses testing  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5

Discussion  This study sheds light on the influence of computer-mediated communication on team leader trustworthiness in global team environments by exploring the influence of culture, self-disclosure as well as communication media on perceptions of trustworthiness of the leadership of a virtual team We found that culture had a significant influence on all three dimensions of trustworthiness. Players from the US had higher levels of trust toward their leader than players from China. Further, we found that both breadth and depth of the virtual communication had significant positive influence on all three dimensions of trustworthiness. This means the more team members feel able and free to discuss a wide range of topics breadth\with their leadership and/or feel able to reveal personal information \(depth\e more the trust toward the leadership increases as relationships develop. Our findings indicate that the relationship between breadth and perceptions of trustworthiness is moderated on one dimension \(ability\ by culture. On the other hand the relationship between the depth of communication and trust was moderated on all three dimensions by culture. These results show that for Americans a wider range of topics results in higher perceptions of trustworthiness on the dimension of ability than for Chinese. In accordance with that findings indicate that for people from China the intimate and private content resulting from higher depth of communication played a significant higher role for all three dimensions of trustworthiness than for Americans. As predicted, this study shows that higher frequency of computer-mediated communication had a significant influence on perceptions of trustworthiness While the use of synchronous media had a strong influence on perceptions of leader´s ability and benevolence, no effect on integrity could be shown The use of asynchronous media had positive influence on all dimensions of trustworthiness. Our findings indicate that the relationships between synchronous media use and perceptions of trustworthiness as well as asynchronous media use and perceptions of trustworthiness are moderated on all dimensions by culture. These results show that for Chinese Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 
 


participants the use of synchronous communication media leads to much higher levels of perceptions of trustworthiness than for American participants whereas the use of asynchronous media leads to much higher levels of perceptions of trustworthiness for American participants than for Chinese participants As we noted in the beginning of the paper, many organizations today utilize virtual teams that carry strategically important tasks. Therefore, managers and organizations need to recognize the strategic importance of managing trust toward the leader of such a virtual team that is technology-enabled. When dealing with global teams of mixed cultures, the leaders have to be aware of the differences of relationships between self-disclosure, communication media use and perceptions of trustworthiness Regarding the establishment of trust in the leader of a virtual team, members from China rely more on intimate, private conversations and the use of synchronous media, while members from the US prefer a wider range of topics that is not as intimate and communicated rather via asynchronous media. In order to establish and maintain trust toward the leader or the leadership team, the individual culture should be accounted for and communication content and media should be selected to fit most needs Inevitably, this study has some limitations that have to be taken into account in order to adequately interpret the results and judge their generalizability. First, the study was conducted using self-allocated teams from a MMOG. Unlike many real virtual teams, participants in this study did not work for the same organization and the leader had no formal authority. However recent developments show that in successful companies important decision making is distributed throughout the organization to enable people to respond rapidly to change. Hereby, teams are often partly composed of people from outside the institution   T h eref ore, th e f i n d i n g s  m a y particu l arl y be generalizable to these kinds of virtual teams that form function, and disband fairly quickly and depend highly on coordinated action. Second, we employed selfreported measures for several key variables. In some cases \(e.g. synchronous media usage\er sources of data were not available, but there was little reason to expect distortion in self-reporting. In some cases \(e.g dimensions of trustworthiness\ the constructs are intrinsically subjective and perceptual; this condition necessitated the use of self-report [60 T h ird th e choice of synchronous communication media in our study was limited to text chat. This was due to the fact that text chat was the only synchronous communication medium, which was already integrated in the game and therefore all participants had the opportunity to use it All other media such as voice chat would have required participants to install additional software. Nevertheless offering richer media such as audio or video chat which are closer to face-to-face communication, could mitigate the relatively lower levels of trust in China Future research may build upon the results of this study in a number of ways. Extending this study and also include mixed teams with members from different cultural backgrounds could further deepen the understanding of the antecedents of trustworthiness and the cultural influence. Moreover, the role of communication in building trustworthiness could be investigated to a larger extend if integrating richer media would be possible \(audio or video chat Additionally, MMOGs as a research platform should be explored further to strengthen the generalizability of the results. In conclusion, the results of this study provide answers to the questions about the perceptions of trustworthiness in virtual teams toward the leader On the whole, this study contributes to the knowledge on the dynamics of trust building in a cooperative, ICT enabled relationship  6.

common concern was compliance with the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \(HIPAA information privacy. Organizations were unsure whether DP products would be HIPAA compliant and even if the products themselves were secure whether their onboard information could be kept secure when the pens are small and easily lost  3.4.3. Implications for DP. Although there was substantial interest in DP technology among professional services and white collar organizations the ethnographic findings suggest that delivering appropriate value from DP technology would be difficult. The first barrier would be providing a platform that either conforms to or changes current behaviors around pen and paper: free availability of pens and unpatterned paper in the workplace behaviors of writing on environmental paper, and the need to keep up with a personal pen with one?s data The second barrier would be to meet expectations around text; much of the value was seen as being in retention and searching of textual information, but this would be made difficult by the frequent inclusion of acronyms, abbreviations symbols, and foreign languages. Many organizations saw value in centralized repositories that would manage DP information across many employees; this would require an IT infrastructure that was not available \(e.g., to manage the DP pattern space might be difficult and expensive to develop and maintain. It also poses questions about privacy, since employees might not wish the archive to retain personal information captured alongside work notes Finally, because we noted real or perceived barriers that were highly specific to various industries it appeared that DP solutions would be most likely to succeed if they were tailored to very specific settings Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 and use cases. This does not argue against DP usage and its value, but it suggests that delivering value to organizations may require substantially more design and development effort than a single general solution or platform would provide  4. Discussion  Our findings show that the interaction model of DP technology diverges substantially from common pen and paper usage. This divergence leads to unclear utility of DP for consumer note-taking purposes, and in a field trial, resulted in high abandonment rate of a consumer DP product. Among the most significant limitations were the low value seen in review of facsimile notes on a PC, the requirement with DP to use a special pen paired with patterned paper, and the low perceived value of capturing only notes taken on blank paper as opposed to handouts and other materials. In the enterprise space, the environmental issues were even more prominent due to the common infrastructure of freely available, communal pens and paper and the lack of IT infrastructure for DP document retention The note-taking research reported here suggests that writing behavior comprises many important areas besides capture, retention, and review of specific data. For instance, a single blank piece of paper or a one-word reminder may adequately serve as a reminder to do something that one intends, even though there may be little or no content as such Likewise, in interpersonal contexts such as attending 


Likewise, in interpersonal contexts such as attending a lecture, it may be socially desirable to take notes even if they are later simply disposed. Taking notes may also serve purposes of memory consolidation even when the content is never reviewed [8][9  4.1 DP and Writing Acts  Linguistic acts in social context have been described using a model of performative behavior commonly known as ?speech acts? theory [15 Chapman [2] extended that model to encompass writing, suggesting that many aspects of ?writing acts are unique and separate from spoken language.  In the extended model, writing acts may be described with a multidimensional taxonomy encompassing a writer?s context, aspects of the process, type of content, and linguistic features of the content Table 3 summarizes the dimensions of writing acts \(from [2 exemplify each dimension. For instance, ?separability denotes the extent to which items in a document are logically independent of one another; in a contract nothing is separable because the document is a single piece, while on a to-do list, many or all items may be independent of one another [2 DP technology may benefit from attention to the dimensions that are exemplified by writing acts embedded in social contexts. DP systems may be able to perform some kinds of writing acts quite well, but in other cases, DP may be inconvenient, unnecessary or inappropriate. Models such as the writing acts framework can be used both to understand user behavior broadly and systematically to explore the applicability of DP products across the general space of writing behavior A key problem for DP in note taking applications is that note taking can involve nearly every possible dimension of writing acts. Notes may be separable or not; they may serve as functional content or as contextual reminders; they may present just the facts? or be more interpretive; they may be transient or might be intended to be archival documents; and so forth. In short, notes are able to present a vast array of writing styles that pose substantially different value propositions and technological implications for DP products Delivering a general DP solution for note taking may therefore be expected to be difficult  Table 3: Dimensions of Writing Acts [2  Dimension Exemplars Separability a contract vs. a to-do list Function a typed inventory list vs calligraphy Emotionality a love letter vs. a packing slip Spatiality a transcript of speech vs. a diagram depicting concept relationships Associativity notes from class vs. doodling Linearity chronological notes vs. notes placed in a spatial ordering scheme Originality an essay vs. feedback on a manuscript Prescriptivity a signature vs. general notes Finality a document that will be archival vs. one that is a draft Structure a grocery list vs. concepts from a brainstorm Personality a letter to someone vs. a 


Personality a letter to someone vs. a journalistic essay Formality a business letter vs. a greeting card to a close friend  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 For product development purposes, the writing acts framework can be used to ensure coverage of use cases by generating possible scenarios combining various attributes of written documents. These potential combinations may then be explored evaluated, and prioritized for research attention development effort, or testing  4.2 Possible Directions for DP Technology  4.2.1. Note taking. What would make DP technology more popular for note taking? Our research suggests that this is a complex question because there are numerous behavioral barriers. The largest single problem for DP may be that it is a closed system comprising a special pen and patterned paper and does not function with the wide array of writing utensils and paper products that people use especially for environmentally available pens, paper and documents. If this problem could be solved or mitigated through an expanded DP technology platform, DP would avoid the large behavioral block posed by the current need for users to change their existing pen and paper habits DP effectively focuses on notes as data neglecting many aspects of the embedded social nature and process function of notes. If DP notes were easily integrated into a wider range of behavioral processes, adoption should increase. For example, if notes could be automatically handled for content such as phone numbers, appointment times reminders, temporary content, and the like, then the DP platform would come closer to matching current pen and paper usage. However, in many cases, there is a separate and larger issue: computer technology today also is not integrated into such processes. To take a simple example, consider a written grocery list Even if the problem could be solved to recognize extract, and transfer the list to a PC, it would be of little use because, for most people, the PC itself is not integrated into the grocery shopping process. Much information of this kind is transient; there is no need to manage or retain it once the paper has been used An example of potentially closer workflow integration is shown in the recently released Livescribe Pulse Smartpen [11], which couples the Anoto DP platform with audio recording such that note takers can review the audio of a meeting or lecture at the exact point that a note was written. We believe that these kinds of additions to base DP functionality are likely to appeal to specific niches of users, but as more use cases like these are enabled over time, DP may successively attain value for larger numbers of users In our field trials and organizational visits, one of the most common customer expectations was that DP notes should be converted from handwriting to text; respondents commonly noted that PC data is of little use unless it is transcribed to text. To meet customer demands, a DP product will need to address this expectation: the DP must either deliver text recognition with very high accuracy, which is a difficult problem, or it should manage the expectation in some other way that preserves customer perception of value from PC integration 


of value from PC integration The high cost of DP products \(approximately US 100 for a pen, plus the need for specially patterned paper demonstrable additional benefit. Transferring notes from paper to a PC today merely involves typing Unless the need for automation is great and the DP function is nearly perfect, users may simply prefer to type or to carry paper rather than to change behavior to use expensive and less flexible technology  4.2.2. Structured input. As noted in the Introduction above, another use case for DP technology is structured input of information. In particular, DP technology may be useful for form-based input into database and workflow systems, where information is initially recorded on paper forms and then automatically transferred from the pen to a database application. Although the present research report is concerned primarily with note taking applications, in the course of our enterprise research we discussed potential applications for forms-based DP usage We noted possible use cases that fell into five general areas: \(1 easier input of information by customers, such as clients filling out deposit or withdrawal slips at a bank; \(2 information from paper to database without needing to rekey or type the information, such as factory inspection and quality assurance logs, traffic tickets shipping manifests, and so forth; \(3 environments that were not suitable for handheld computing devices, such as construction sites and some kinds of manufacturing facilities; \(4 in which paper-based records are desirable for either employee compliance or customer comfort, such as medical settings; and \(5 based records are necessary, e.g., for legal reasons but a DP product could support faster turnaround and error correction. An example of such application involved financial forms that undergo offsite optical character recognition; a DP system might allow immediate recognition and error correction We plan to report this line of research fully in the future. For now, we note that each of those areas has various benefits and potential limitations with regard to DP technology. Forms-based use cases are more precisely defined and structured than note taking, in Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 terms of environment, workflow, and content; the information context, form design, and potential for systems integration with rapid feedback may mitigate issues with handwriting recognition; and enterprise customers may be less price sensitive than consumers Thus, structured input appears to be a more promising near-future application of DP technology than note taking  4.3 Research Discussion  As we noted above, the present research was primarily behavioral and qualitative. Thus, despite the strength and consistency of our results across multiple samples, contexts, and locations, we present no specific metrics or tested hypotheses on user behavior with DP products. Our findings could be used to inform directional hypotheses for future depth or quantitative research. For instance, one might formulate and test hypotheses about cultural differences, interest levels in DP between various groups such as professional and non-professional 


office workers, market research metrics such as price sensitivity, and the like It is important to underscore the value of ethnographic fieldwork in the present research. It would be possible to conduct design research that explores how to make DP technology better, e.g., in terms of usability and function, without investigating exactly what people would do with such products and why. It was only when we investigated behavior in depth that we discovered the divergence of DP products? limited current value for note taking, as opposed to the high value that one might presume in the absence of depth research  5. Conclusion  In our research, initial trials of digital pens in a controlled setting \(Research Series 2 above suggested potentially good fit between digital pen functionality and consumer note taking needs However, when we explored real world behavior in note taking \(Research Series 1, 3, and 4 above found many potential barriers to adoption of digital pens for note taking. In particular, traditional pen and paper offer advantages in terms of cost, widespread and ad hoc availability, flexibility to work with multiple sources seamlessly, behavioral workflow integration, and manageability of content The value of using digital pens will increase if manufacturers are able to expand their platform technology progressively to enable broader coverage of behavioral scenarios and habits, focusing on the broad range of writing behaviors rather than just needs for facsimile replication on a computer Alternatively, digital pen technology may be more easily applied to tasks involving structured input rather than unstructured note taking We suggest that DP development efforts should use existing linguistic frameworks \(e.g., [2 the space of writing acts of interest. This should allow DP products to target behavioral needs in a more focused manner, leading to higher customer adoption  6.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
