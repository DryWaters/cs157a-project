Task behaviors during web search The difficulty of assigning labels  Daniel M. Russell, Diane Tang, Melanie Kellar, Robin Jeffries Google 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043 drussell, diane, kellar, jeffries @google.com    Abstract  By examining searcher behavior on a large search engine, we have identified seven basic kinds of task behaviors that can be observed in web search session logs.  In the studies reported, we first manually labeled 700 complete web sessions, and then 
subsequently had 23 searchers self-label 252 days of their own sessions to give an accurate picture of what kinds of tasks people are doing when they search From these two studies, we have found that the most accurate labeling of search task session data is done by the searchers themselves, and that it is very difficult for an external observer or automatic classifier to infer where the task boundaries are or what the actual user task goal is  1. Introduction  How do searchers behave while doing web search?  Do they unerringly create a query, refine it and discover the answer to their question?  The more we understand about user intent and behaviors, the 
better we can tune search engine algorithms and the user experience of search.  However, understanding user intent is difficult: without knowing the task a priori, examining a web search session requires a leap of understanding and empathy with the searcher since a common reaction is one of amazement what is this person trying to do  Related work There has been a great deal of previous research that examines and identifies categories of information seeking and searching 
behavior.  The methodology used to develop these categorizations usually consists of log analysis combined with a secondary method for discovering the user intent. This secondary method ranges from qualitative interviews, to self-labeled data, to thirdparty ratings and classifications.  [2, 4, 6, 7, 8   These categorizations were developed by examining the entire sequence of user actions.  In contrast, research examining search goals and queries is often conducted through the analysis of single queries, often without the context of a session or 
user-specified intent.

2. Two Studies of Search Task Behavior  2.1 Study #1 Identifying New Task Categories We initially tried having humans assign searchtask-type labels to search sessions using the Rose and Levinson taxonomy.  In doing so, we found that there is often great ambiguity; while we found good interrater agreement on navigation search type sessions we were not able to get sufficient inter-rater agreement on more ambiguous search tasks.  As a result, the goal of our first study was to attempt to reproduce the earlier search task categorization work without assuming their task categories Method In mid-2006 we began an effort to rederive a canonical set of search-task descriptions.   In a long series of analyses, a group of seven web research professionals reviewed 700 anonymized sessions. Sessions were randomly sampled from a world-wide set of English-language sessions during March-April 2006, and varied in length from 2 to 100 events \(1 to 5 separate search tasks\d spanning no more than 24 hours.  Thus, each session comprised all the activity for a given cookie during a single day Each session was carefully anonymized according to policy, and contained the queries, query refinements next pages, the complete list of  results shown, and the result clicks Each session was closely read by each researcher then discussed to determine searcher behavior and intent. The panel attempted to find labels that would accurately characterize each session.  After the first 100 sessions were open-coded in this way, definitions of each label were written by the panel, then applied to the next set of 100 sessions.  Each iteration lasted approximately one day, during which new labels were proposed as needed, label definitions rewritten and ill-fitting labels discarded or reworked At the end of the process, the panel went through 7 iterations, emerging with a new search-task categorization made up of session behavior labels and definitions.  As in other analyses of this kind [1, 2, 5  is pan e l iden ti f i ed 7 bas i c k i n d s of s e archt a s k behaviors, although our basic task definitions vary from previous literature.  \(See Table 2 Hand labeling task data After creating this task categorization, we wanted to understand the relative frequency of each task type.  We instructed other user experience researchers in how to use the search task categories for identification and labeling according to the task definitions we had defined.  That is, we were trying to use humans to determine task boundaries where the task starts and ends\within longer sessions and then label each task.  Each session was labeled by 4 researchers independently After labeling 700 sessions with 4025 queries, we found poor agreement among our researcher raters with inter-rater agreement on task boundaries to be quite low, 54.3%.   What was worse, even when the pairs of raters agreed on a task boundary, the interrater agreement on task types was still low at ~50 The biggest problem was a failure to agree on the definitions of the task types Explore/Learn \(EL Locate/Acquire \(LA\, and Find-Complex \(FC Surprisingly, there was even contention between Explore/Learn and Navigate.  With such widely varying interpretations \(even after many meetings for definitions clarification\, we realized that labeling by other people was simply too error-prone given our current state of knowledge. We began a new study to collect self-labeled sessions from expert searchers   Navigate query\(ies\ leading to a site at which the main task can be performed.  Navigation queries are often the names of destination sites, or terms that are heavily suggestive of the target site.  Example: find Apple s Quicktime web page  Find-Simple searching for an evident piece of information that does not require multiple sources of information. Example: find the local YMCA phone number  Find-Complex searching for information that requires searches on very closely related topics to integrate information across resources; often marked by a sequence of searches to find information that is coordinated.  Example:  search for a way to knit winter socks that uses a search for sock patterns and knitting instructions  Locate/Acquire the searcher is looking to download something, purchase an item, obtain a good or service. Example: find tickets to the game  Explore/Learn searches that are intended to discover something or learn about a topic area Example: finding out how to raft on the Grand Canyon, information about the tourist season, local flora and fauna  Play activity where the searches are intended to find games, fun content or items for amusement Example: finding sites to play online computer games celebrity searches, etc  Meta search tasks that are to test some capability.  Example: testing a web site s capabilities  Table 2 Web search task definitions  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


2.2 Study #2 Now armed with a new search-task taxonomy we began asking for users to create their own labeled web search histories Method To create a new search session sample 23 software professionals \(a mix of software engineers and UX practitioners\le were recruited for this study. \(They were not compensated for their participation.\ch subject was given instruction on how to segment and label their personal web history and instructed to take their time and strive for accuracy rather than quantity.  Each subject labeled 1 to 2 weeks of their immediate past web search history, dividing the history into labeled tasks and indicating both the number of tasks performed and the number of searches each task required.  For anonymity, we did not ask for the log itself, but just the day, the sequence, the task label and the number of searches done for each task We relied on the participants to self-identify the task boundaries and task types based on our taxonomy description.  It quickly became clear that in many cases, the searcher had access to internal state and information that wasn t clearly available to an external observer, such as where the task boundaries were between very similar-appearing searches Analysis A few observations became immediately apparent.  First, even though this user population is highly biased towards sophisticated users, the total number of tasks and searches / user day was less than we had expected  N searchers 23 Number of days of tasks 252 Number of labeled tasks 957 Number of searches 2109 Searches / user / day 8.05 Tasks / user / day 3.80  Task counts by type Count  FC \(find complex 330 34.5 FS \(find simple 218 22.8 N \(navigate 147 15.4 EL \(explore learn 106 11.1 M \(meta 73 7.6 LA  \(locate-acquire 63 6.6 P  \(play 18 1.9  Table 4 Distribution of task types from sample   It s clear that, in aggregate, searching is relatively efficient in this population: people need only a small number of searches to accomplish a task \(~2\n fact, tasks with 1, 2, or 3 searches were 84% of all tasks, with 55% of all tasks involve only 1 search 18% have 2 searches, and 10% have 3 During the process of creating the taxonomy, we were tempted to further divide up the FC and FS categories, especially given that they are the most common task type as seen in Table 4.  However during the data collection process, we fielded enough queries about the exact definitions for FS vs. FC that we became unconvinced that even searches themselves, much less third party raters, would be able to more accurately categorize their behavior   FS and FC task length distribution 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 12345678910More FS FC   Figure 1 Find-Simple \(FS\ and Find-Complex \(FC tasks take different numbers of searches to reach their goals However, when we compare the task length of FC and FS tasks, it is clear that FS tasks really are simple: 66% of all FS tasks take only 1 query while 62% of all FC tasks take 2 or more.  On average, FS tasks require 1.6 searches / task, while FC tasks need 2.6 searches.  As Figure 1 shows, complex tasks require more searches \(and, we suspect, more time although this data does not include that fine resolution time-to-result data  3. Discussion  Labeling tasks is hard: Our first study looked for a set of task labels that we could accurately use to label searcher behavior.  While earlier work suggested there is a fine set of distinctions to be made, we quickly learned that the application of a fine-grained set of labels was problematic in practice In Study #1 we found that even trained raters had a Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


difficult time following analysis instructions and creating a consistent labeling of web search session behaviors.  So we turned to having the searchers label their own behaviors and gathered a reasonable sized dataset from a highly skilled and frequent searcher population Population bias: Even with such a bias, the actual behaviors seem somewhat surprising, with fewer tasks per day than expected \(~ 3 tasks / user / day Those tasks tend to be Find-Complex or Find-Simple in nature, and tend to be fairly efficient, taking only 1, 2, or 3 searches to successfully complete The relative ratio of task types was also somewhat surprising, with FC leading the overall tasks, and making up just over 1/3rd of all tasks. We suspect that the FC is high because of user population in this study.  FC tasks pull together information from a number of sources, often \(but not always\ from multiple web pages to resolve a question that doesn t have a single, findable answer. This is a common task type for this population.  Similarly the number of Play tasks \(P\eems low by contrast to other reports We hypothesize that different populations will have rather different relative task profiles. Not all populations will have high FC and low P.  Because of these differences, we would encourage other researchers to include in similarly detailed population descriptions in their results  4.  Comparison with literature  Although comparisons are somewhat difficult between different studies in the literature, we noted some differences between what the Rose and Levinson study reported and what we found.  In their sample, ~60% of searches are informational, ~13 navigational, and 24% resource access.  Nearly all of the studies agree that Navigation comprises ~15% of all search tasks, including ours.  The one exception is from Broder, where the survey shows 25 navigationa W e  n o te th at th i s num ber w a s  derived by a pop-up survey of AltaVista users in the middle of their search task.  It s unclear if the questions were rotated to avoid first-order question effects, but given that the logs analysis of Navigation queries in the same study showed 20%, it would seem that both numbers are high with-respect-to current practices We label the majority tasks as either FindComplex \(FC\ or Find-Simple \(FS\, while Rose divides the tasks into subcategories of Directed Closed/Open, Advice / Locate / List. While these seem clear enough when seen example by example we found the distinctions too dependent on the details of the user s mental state at the time of the task to be determined externally.  It was illuminating to us that our human task labelers kept asking questions to refine the definition of EL vs. FC and FS vs. FC.  To compensate for this problem, we shifted our taxonomy to be based on a simpler criterion to keep rating accuracy high If we group FC and FS together and compare directly to the Informational category of Rose, then we see rough agreement:  57.3% \(our study\ vs 61% \(Rose\y contrast, Jansen  Informational tasks at ~81%, but we believe their classifier is a bit too broad \(queries are classified as Informational if they contain one or more of a set of informational cue terms, which is probably too open for this kind of classifier  5.  Summary  Inferring user intent from their behavior is more difficult that it would first appear.  Yet knowing their intents and goals is essential in assessing whether or not the user interaction for search is working well or not And while tasks are predominantly short \(< 3 searches according to our population, and this observation is consistent with the population at large\ the task requires knowing significantly more about the goal and mental state of the searcher than can be determined just by examining the query.  Even apparently simple queries can hide complexities More generally, inferring user behavior from a small number of data points is very hard.  This is a lesson that applies generally to web-based interactions.  Task boundaries are often difficult to determine and the underlying goals are even harder This suggests that the approach to getting high quality labeled behavior data is to have the searchers do self-rating.  In the face of our inability to get reliable inter-rater results and the complexity of web search trace as we see it in the logs, this will likely be the case for quite some time to come  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4

connection with the data center \(e.g. cellular links T interface certainly allows seamless data transfer from the remote-node across the satellite, cellular or other WAN networks. The NAT will not become a blocking factor for this implementation. One of the drawbacks in allowing centralized SWE components to manage the 79 sensing and response across high-latency WAN networks is the response-delay related issues    Figure 2. Individual nodes inserting their observations into the SWE database via SOS-T   SWE infrastructure at the central sites in this scenario cannot be effectively leveraged for  actuation  at the remote sites \(connected via satellite potential other WAN link-quality issues  Figure 3 shows the SOS capability exchange when a sensor is added to the OGC SWE system in a plug n  play fashion. The nodes on the private IP LAN network are not reachable due to IP NAT and Firewall configured on the IP network router    Figure 3. Capability exchange using SOS commands when a sensor is added in a plug n  play fashion    3.1. IDSS between Sensor and SWE components  IDSS network platforms combine the network-features with the application-features. An intermediate IDSS system between the legacy-sensors &amp; SWE components offers a single point of integration for multiple sensors behind the IDSS network. This also reduces the need for upgrading the legacy-sensors to the next-generation smartsensors at the existing remote sites. IDSS implementation also abstracts the legacy sensor information into SWE compliant web-services  Effective and non-blocking protocols between the sensors and SWE architecture will allow more flexible usage of SWE components in mobile and tactical environment This helps to connect a large volume of currently deployed sensors and system, without the need for IP network re-engineering. This is especially interesting for the net-centric mobile and tactical solutions for adding enhanced real-time sensing capabilities at the networkedge  The growing need for localized detection, identification processing, analysis and integration \(with modeling and inference engines of IDSS at the network edge  The data from the sensors can be simultaneously used at multiple stages. The IDSS based local solution is the local consumer of the Sensor information in order to trigger the local response. However even the local response could involve information-gathering from the regional \(or global  IDSS network platforms do not function as a historian or archival system, whereas the SWE infrastructure can be pushed the real-time information and then queried to fetch trends or patterns related information for better situational 


trends or patterns related information for better situational awareness  In general, any network centric Sensor Web Enablement solutions should be optimized to consider the IP networking best practices including the impact of NAT and Firewall in the tactical, remote, mobile and fixed network topologies. The SWE services in the centralized infrastructure need to function as IP Network  Server   and implement the smart sensors, actuators and systems as IP Network  Clients  Alternatively, the web-services should allow pull-based as well as push-based methods for every SOS components, to allow enough flexibility while designing &amp; implementing the IP networks  The following are some scenarios that can benefit from the IDSS enabled IP network-edge  80 3.2. Connected First-Responders  Firemen operate under extremely hostile environments including toxic smoke and high temperatures. This simplified example about the safety and monitoring of the firefighter operations extends the Local Area Networks LAN PAN devices become satellite nodes to the IDSS Network Platforms  First-Responders and Firemen that handle toxic materials wear a Level-A suite. It becomes important to monitor fatigue using sensors since these suites entirely cover the first responder. A PAN gateway can be used by the Firemen to connect various sensors and devices \(Sensor Pack Table 5 below  Table 5.  Example of a Sensor-Pack on Firemen    In the event of a massive event, the firefighters from neighboring counties may also join the firefighting mission, and bring their own sensor-packs. The IP addresses assigned to the sensor-packs deployed during the firefighting mission cannot be pre-assigned. Also given the urgency of the mission, the networking devices such as routers and firewalls can not be manually configured on site  The Common Operating Picture \(COP needs to periodically get data from the sensor-packs and also send commands as needed. The working solution is required to be dynamic and always connected to the local and central situational awareness tools  In an emergency solution the local applications attached to the IDSS network platforms can effectively monitor the sensors attached to the firemen while IDSS can also forward the information to the SWE components for global visibility into the emerging events  Complying with the IP network best-practices while designing the mobile and fixed solutions, will certainly result in network agnostic plug-n-play capability for sensor and systems integration. In addition to resolving the connectivity issues, IPv6 support is also becoming necessary for many solutions  Table 6.  Recommendations &amp; Best-Practices for IP Network Centric Collaboration 


Network Centric Collaboration    An analogy would be the hotel scenario where multiple hotel-guests bring their own laptops and connect over the hotel network. The hotel IP network-router assigns each of the laptops a unique private IP address using DHCP protocol, and all the guests are able to browse the internet Similarly the firemen from different counties should be able to come together and connect to their sensor packs to the centralized systems for real-time monitoring &amp response capabilities  4. IDSS SOLUTION DETAILS  IDSS is a small form-factor embedded-software solution It can be deployed for Infrastructure protection to facilitate local Sensing, Detection, Alerting and Notification services. A military base installation protection example shows the relevance of a local IDSS network platform to automate Standard Operating Procedures \(SOP Conditions \(FPCON   81 The five Force Protection Conditions are NORMAL ALPHA, BRAVO, CHARLIE, DELTA. IDSS can be tailored and configured to automate the qualification of the FPCON based on the real-time sensor conditions Following the FPCON identification, pre-defined actions can be triggers through the available and connected systems \(such as alerting, notification, reporting deploying-policies etc    Figure 4. Infrastructure protection scenario using IDSS Network platform  IDSS can be configured to continuously monitor the local sensors around the installation. Figure4 shows the network topology including the branch-router integrated with IDSS software for infrastructure protection. If the conditions such as Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear or Explosive \(CBRNE thresholds, it may cause FPCON upgrade. In parallel to monitoring the local sensors, IDSS can push the sensor information to approved SWE infrastructure. Global Common Operating Picture \(COP systems can be integrated through the SWE infrastructure IDSS can also control the local access-control systems activate local gates and barriers to block access to protect the infrastructure and safeguard the occupants  FPCON DELTA may trigger increased IP security including IP network policies that disconnect the network connecting the facility to the outside-networks \(extranets IDSS can be tailored to monitor network services to implement access-lists to block network access as required  Under certain events such as a large installation fire emergency, the firemen and ambulances from neighboring counties may need to be notified through OASIS CAP 1.1 or other standards based methods. Firemen need to coordinate the emergency response activities with the local response teams at the military installation. IDSS network platforms can serve as tactical &amp; mobile platforms to enable inter-agency interoperability  Some of the installations are not large and may not have local IT experts to maintain the data-center based 


local IT experts to maintain the data-center based solutions. In such scenarios a small form-factor IDSS can be a good fit for local sensor monitoring and response capability  5. IDSS FEATURES  IDSS is networked locally, leveraging the existing network infrastructure. Sensors are integrated into IDSS by implementing respective software drivers. Similarly the Systems and upstream integration using web-services are also integrated using the XML based services. Some of the features enabled by IDSS include  Table 6.  A Summary of IDSS Features    The strength of IDSS solution comes from its ability to package sensors and systems by enhancing an existing network infrastructure.  IDSS solutions are focused around enabling smart branch or remote IP network infrastructure. IDSS implementations are agnostic to the Command Center COP or other upstream applications  The examples of packaged IDSS kits include Carry-on Commanders-kit\(CK RRK Deployable Communication kit\(DCK First responders, Smart Branch Network Kits enabling energy-efficient smart buildings, Biometrics sensors integration kit, CBRNE Sensor Integration Kit, Medical 82 Response &amp; Telemedicine kit, Border Security \(RADAR Video Surveillance, Perimeter Security etc   Protection kit \(Chemical sensors, plume Modeling systems and COP industrial maintenance  6. SWE ARCHITECTURE COUPLING WITH IDSS  OGC SWE initiative is focused on developing standards to enable the discovery, exchange, and processing of sensor observations, as well as the tasking of sensor systems  SWE services can play an important role in enabling global situational awareness and inter-agency collaboration for effective response to a large and small scale events. The growth of SWE infrastructure would over-time enable significant data archival of current and past events and therefore aid the  data-mining  and  modeling  services to granularly predict the trends and correlation of global events. It has become increasingly important to have the ability to model, predict and respond to natural and man-made events, and SWE services could positively influence the decision making at central and global levels. The IDSS can be deployed to send and receive information from SWE components to feed the real-time data, information, and notification into the SWE architecture, while autonomously managing the local sensor interoperability. IDSS can serve as a proxy for the attached sensors and devices representing them as SWE Nodes for the centralized SWE architecture  Several COTS products and legacy sensors often do not comply with IEEE 1451.x [14] or the SWE standards Also majority of the COTS sensor products do not support IPv6 capabilities. Several of these sensors support RS232 based serial communications

However the users \(the consumers of sensor information analysis and modeling on multiple raw sensor inputs to derive actionable information such as trends, patterns growth of events, automated triggers, real-time response etc. A lot of the sensor information workflow can be locally performed without repeatedly representing all the raw-sensor information as web-services. Optimized solutions such as IDSS use derivers and low-level software solutions for enhanced performance and speed of local response  Databases and web-services can get stressed by real-time interaction with sensors.  Some next-generation Industrial sensors can read up to about 300-400 times per second Extensive use of web-services &amp; databases for highfrequency data exchange with a large number of fastsensors may require more CPU horse-power. Additionally the transactional delays of traditional database \(for example due to database indexing issues potentially slow down the end-to-end workflow  The more efficient hybrid approach is recommended where IDSS integrates the sensors using low-level software stacks.

healthcare information systems, of which EMRs are a part, should provide researchers with new and diverse phenomena to be investigated.  We believe that this paper makes three contributions to EMR research First, we hope to improve understanding of EMR implementation by integrating findings from the ERP literature into EMR research. Second, we hope that by providing some theoretical background and propositions we can help EMR research move forward.  Third, we hope that collecting qualitative data provides some general support in the identification of success factors and a basis for developing more detailed empirical data collection  9.
