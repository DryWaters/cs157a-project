This paper discusses these problems and put forward a solution by constructing a Virtual Web Service to solve the problems of integration application between XML/EDI and web applications. Virtual Web Service gives a unified interface that supports EDI service of different enterprises, helps transfer information among services, make XML/EDI services more stable and reliable, and less affected by real services provider. This solution can be implemented to not only EDI systems between enterprises, but also other Web applications  Key words-B2B, Virtual Web Service, Web Service, XML/EDI I. INTRODUCTION As is known to all, traditional EDI \(Electronic Dada Interchange Value added network VAN, expands potential customers, and brings EDI into a generation of open EDI The standard technology adopted by XML [1], which has been proved most suitable for Web development, is applied to Internet EDI to get a true Web style EDI--XML/EDI. XML supports structural data and can define data structure of a data object in great details, such as product description. These XML data which are defined with the manufacturer, name, number and origin of a product can provide great convenience for tagging this product and are also easily sorted and queried by key words such as manufacturer, name, etc.. If business rules need to be changed, for instance, while filling a purchasing order, a seller may want to add some remarks to reflect some business practices, XML/Web is able to adapt to change easily while former fixed format EDI is difficult to do so XML/EDI introduces the concept of Template, which solves a main problem of EDI  mapping. Template describes not data of messages, but structures of messages and how to explain messages and realize message mapping without programming On user computers, software agent parses template and processes messages by the best ways. If user application adopts XML/EDI, the agent can complete mapping automatically and get right messages. Meanwhile, the agent can produce a Web sheet for users. XML/EDI can process messages and complete mapping by itself at user  s end at less cost. By Template, user can get the best integration of the environment. Template can be saved in other places and combined dynamically to local application. These make XML/EDI a true Web style EDI It is asymmetry for big and small enterprises to get information and benefits from traditional EDI. But XML/EDI is different. It can let all participants get benefits from EDI. As a symmetrical EDI, it is determined by XML structure and its specialties of document type definition \(DTD Moreover, XML hyperlink can further point the action. The interoperability of XML itself can benefit all XML/EDI participants despite they are big or small companies II. BASIC TECHNOLOGIES OF XML/EDI XML/EDI is a synthesis of many concepts. XML/EDI  uses the XML protocol as its "data interchange modeling" layer  uses the XSL protocol as its "presentation" layer  can be integrated with traditional methods of Electronic Data Interchange \(EDI 


 can be used with all standard Internet transport mechanisms such as IP routing, HTTP, FTP and SMTP  allows document-centric views and processing methodologies  uses modern programming tools such as Java and ActiveX to share data between programs  uses agent technologies for data manipulation, parsing mapping, searching   XML/EDI can be seen as a fusion of five existing technologies [2] \(See Figure 1  This work was supported in part by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2006AA01Z165 Figure 1. The Five Technologies of XML/EDI 978-1-4244-4507-3/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE   Web data interchange based on new XML specification  Existing EDI business methods and message structures  Knowledge templates that provide process control logic  Data manipulation agents \(DataBots specialist functions  Data repositories that allow relationships to be maintained III. PROBLEMS ON APPLICATION OF XML/EDI A. XML Lacking Semantic Description Capability Although the flexibility of XML enables business messages to be described quickly and easily, XML cannot explain the meanings of its tags, most of process applications require these tagging sets to meet some standards or mutual agreements XML allows users to define these tagging sets by XML modes XML modes such as XML DTD and XML Schema provide a constraining mechanism to restrict tags used in XML documents and structure relationship between these tags. XML modes provide a certain semantic description  capability  but these semantics are connotative. The element meanings of XML modes are either concluded by their names \(which are described by natural language modes can not give any semantic explanation to what they contain. To realize the explanation and switch of XML documents, users must encode these semantics to tools and leave the ultimate explanation of data to specific application. What  s more, XML modes can only test XML semantic validity, but cannot distinguish the different meanings between XML properties and the elements. Therefore, we can map the same information to various XML Schemas [3 Since XML does not have semantic description capability W3C recommends RDF \(Resource Description Framework standards to solve XML semantic limits B.  Integration with other IT systems in an enterprise XML/EDI can not solve by itself the problem of integration with other IT system in an enterprise, that is, EDI system gets required data from other IT systems in the enterprise and transmits the data to other IT systems. Furthermore, XML/EDI may not be suitable to the change since the enterprise requirement is changing C.  Access EDI systems between enterprises EDI Data formats are not uniform in different areas and networks, therefore mistakes may be made in the process of information exchange IV. PROBLEMS ON APPLICATION OF WEB SERVICES ARCHITECTURE A.  Traditional web services architecture Figure 2 depicts a general framework of the web service architecture. UDDI registry is a WSDL document storage [4][5 Service providers publish their WSDL documents to the UDDI registry before services requester searches them. When the service requester knows how to access the Web service, it will directly communicate with the Web service provider through SOAP messages [6  


 B.  User cannot invoking business process while service provider changing In this traditional web services architecture model, the requester directly calls the web service providers through SOAP protocol, processing the protocol and address by itself [7]. Once the address of a web service is changed, the procedure on the requester application needs to be changed correspondingly C.  WSDL document lacking semantic description for service discovery Web services registered on the UDDI are always exactly matched by keywords, mainly in service name ID, or limited service value of the properties, like searching engines. UDDI brings the registry for users to find Web services conveniently but users often feel discontented with its precision and efficiency V. VIRTUAL WEB SERVICE SOLUTION To solve XML/EDI  s problems, this paper proposes a solution: Virtual Web service \(VWS A.  What is VWS This solution constructs a Virtual Web Service based on Web services. VWS locates on the top to manage all kinds of Web services \(such as enterprises EDI service differences of accessing them, and provides a uniform interface for requesters. As for requesters, they can not detect or do not care any differences between Web services, as far as they can use the same way to request services provided by different enterprises \(See Figure 3 To solve the problems on current Web such as heterogeneous format and semantics of information, and the multiplicity of relations between the non-uniformed information, VWS introduces a concept of ontology and correlative technology into the Web services. Ontology can be used to distinguish a glossary of terms, as well as meanings of these terms and their relationship. At present, researchers put forward a special service semantic description language OWL-S Relative to XML, RDF and RDF-Schema, OWL-S has more mechanism to express the semantics search publish UDDI provider requester SOAP Figure. 2. web service architecture  The description of a service provides a general framework that allows data sharing and reuse across applications. In order to make Web services intelligible and easy to use, the mechanism of VWS can dynamically and automatically process Web service discovery, execution, composition and cooperation. The structure of the service ontology is constituted by three essential types of knowledge on a service \(show in Figure 4 functionalities that a Web service wants to provide to the client The Service Profile tells  what the service does  the Service Model tells a client how to use the service, and the Service Grounding specifies the details on how an agent can access a service [8  Figure 4. Top level of the service ontology Based on OWL-S description of the semantic Web services VWS can calculate the similarities of web services, including semantic similarities of words, service attributes, parameters structures and so on [9 By the non-functional description, VWS takes full advantage of Semantic Web services, which play a more important role in the expression of Web services. VWS uses Word-net or How-Net semantic knowledge dictionaries to calculate the distance between words B.  VWS mechanism VWS is client/server architecture, which makes it very 


VWS is client/server architecture, which makes it very flexible. VWS mechanism is mainly constituted by the UDDI Registry, Ontologies Data Base, matching engine, and VWS server \(show Figure 5 VWS is also a service broker that can search and save the information of Web provider and Web service, responsible for service requester to obtain the interface and information of Web service. For instance, a requester that needs the latest quotes from the stock market may compile a service profile of a financial news service. Requests are sent to UDDI Registry and the VWS find the best match from the profiles advertised by all providers  services The central part is the VWS Server. The VWS Server traps all Web service events and sends them to appropriate applications. If an application wants to get a Web service, it sends requests to the VWS Server, which then performs the necessary service type calls  UDDI Registry is used to store the information of service provider. The mapping relationships between WSDL and OWL-S help add semantic markup for web service Ontologies Data Base is used to store the semantic markup for web services. The Functional Description of the service describes the capabilities of the service in terms of inputs outputs, preconditions and effects [10 Based on the matching engine, web services similarities between the requester service and the provider service can be calculated. According to the web service semantic description on ontology, the matching engine can also calculate the semantic similarities of words, attributes, parameters, and so on The main control matching algorithm is shown as below [11 Match\(request BEGIN record= empty service list for all provider  s services in UDDI Registry LOOP if  match\(request, provide then  record.similarity\(request, provide END LOOP return sort\(record END BEGIN VWS server is essentially used for processing requests for service contracts and service match. First of all, VWS extracts each request for input and output parameters of the contract, the Figure 5.

Application Other Systems Business Process Defined Service Business Process Defined Service Business Process  Figure 3. Virtual Web Service framework pre-conditions and post-condition parameters of service to calculate the similarities between the requester service and the provider service, then make sorting based on Similarity Function Matching algorithm. According to the knowledge and rules base, VWS sorts the provider services by the similarity VWS also provides a unified interface above the VWS server. Therefore, requesters do not have to concern the service address and the transfer protocol, and do not have to do any changes in case the service provider changes, since the VWS will re-adopt another service which is most similar to the requester service All of these VWS mechanisms shall overcome the problems mentioned above C.  XML/EDI integrated by VWS By applying VWS, the relationships between XML/EDI will change from traditional structure \(Fig. 6 Fig 7 reliable, and less affected by real services provider    VI. CONCLUSION This paper discusses problems about Web services and application of XML/EDI, constructs Virtual Web Service to solve these problems, and elaborates VWS  s concept and mechanism. This solution can be implemented to not only EDI systems between enterprises, but also other Web applications The future jobs are VWS implementation and application to E-businesses of enterprises ACKNOWLEDGMENT This paper is funded by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2006AA01Z165.

To support this effort the OCFO created a series of measures 1 costing pattern for each funded project in 2008. This gave the resource analysts a baseline to work against 2  exception reports  These reports were used by the OCFO and the Mission Directorates to review the initial plan submissions. The exception reports highlighted any deltas between the 2008 spending pattern and the 2009 plans. In addition the reports also flagged any other errors and rule violations 3 to assist program offices and Centers in estimating the lead times for various types of procurements The second area of improvement was the communication between the functional organizations \(Centers product organizations \(Mission Directorates ownership of the final approved agency phasing plans. A highly interactive process with weekly teleconferences and three video-conferences, supported by enhanced phasing plan tools, was implemented to further open the missioncenter communication during the phasing plan development, review, and approval cycles 6 Finally, commitments \(see footnote 3  in addition to obligations and cost  were added to the set of performance indicators. Since the budget execution process starts with committing funds, the level of commitments could serve as an early warning indicator for obligations. In practice, the actual commitments of 2009 were compared to the historic spending pattern of 2008 6. DISCUSSION How many large-scale projects were canceled before their implementation even started? Project managers are only too familiar with the traditional model, which starts off with an extensive process of requirements collection. After years of producing large documents, the political situation has changed, the key executives have moved on and the project gets  re-scoped   If there was only one lesson learned for the development of management systems, then it is: define a clear goal and keep the requirements collection process as short as possible Start with the  low-hanging fruit  and use what is at hand and has proven its usefulness \(bricolage None of the other enablers was particularly new. However it was the consequent pursuit of a fast and results-oriented implementation that guided project management \(executive sponsor vs. expert facilitator stakeholder involvement, and a flexible software engineering approach \(agile programming Finally, a sustainable success can only be accomplished if the system actually gets used in  every-day  management decisions. In this case, the ABED became the single source of reference for a wide range of budget execution decisions within NASA REFERENCES 1] A.

The subsequent section discusses the evaluation of the designed methodology 


the evaluation of the designed methodology according to the design research paradigm  4. Evaluation of RPBBs  The evaluation described in this paper focuses on RPBBs which are the results of applying the methodology \(not the designed artifact itself Findings about quality and applicability of RPBBs allow conclusions regarding the quality and applicability of the underlying methodology. In this contribution, a formal and a contentual evaluation are differentiated. While the formal part contains theoretical analyses of RPBBs regarding predefined requirements \(cp. Section 3.1 documents the practical \(content-related applicability of RPBBs  4.1. Formal Evaluation  As part of the research project, twelve workshops and several interviews in European municipalities have been conducted which involved domain experts and modeling specialists who had to benchmark each RPBB with regards to fulfillment of the defined design goals \(cp. section 3.1 completely fulfilled, +/- partially fulfilled, - not fulfilled  not evaluated yet municipalities provided process models that were used to identify process activities and to design the RPBB. However they were not involved in the design process thus ensuring validity of the evaluation results through separation of data used to develop the method from evaluation data. As already mentioned in Section 3.1, the requirement of a minimal number Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 of RPBBs is replaced by relevancy/necessity. If all RPBBs are considered relevant and necessary, the number of RPBBs can be assumed minimal. Three RPBBs have not been evaluated, as they have just been identified during the prior evaluation period Table 6 provides an overview of the results  Table 6: Evaluation of RPBBs Requirements No. of evaluated RPBBs    Modularity 24 10 0 3 Reusability 33 1 0 3 Comprehensibility 31 3 0 3 Unambiguity 20 14 0 3 Documentation 33 1 0 3 Relevancy/Necessity 27 7 0 3 Multilingualism 34 0 0 3 Level of Generality 33 1 0 3 Level of Detail 22 12 0 3  Altogether, the degree of accomplishment can be considered as high. There is no RPBB that does not meet the demands. However, deficiencies can be identified regarding modularity, unambiguity and level of detail. Examples for deficits concerning the level of detail are the RPBBs ?send? and ?archive Especially archiving can be understood as a modular activity or separate process fragment. Weaknesses regarding modularity and unambiguity are closely related to the demand that only minimal overlapping should occur. Although overlapping could not be prevented completely, the evaluators? feedback initiated extensive revisions on names, synonyms examples and explanations of RPBBs. A list of the most deficient RPBBs is presented in Table 7. These 


most deficient RPBBs is presented in Table 7. These RPBBs have to be carefully analyzed during further modeling activities in order to be improved or rejected  Table 7: List of most deficient RPBBs RPBB No. of Deficiencies Coordinate 10 Assign 3 Take from 3 Change/Update/Complete 3  Summarizing, suitability of RPBBs for distributed modeling of collaborative processes can be confirmed on the basis of the formal evaluation However, evaluation from a content-based perspective provides more experience-driven and thus, practice-related feedback 4.2. Contentual Evaluation  For contentual, practice-oriented evaluation, a number of 200 processes have been modeled with five municipalities that are involved in the project to prove practical applicability. Using a prototypical web-based tool implementation, the modeling was carried out in a distributed manner by public administration officials. The procedure for distributed collaborative modeling required each official to depict the present status of their process fragments as well as the information flow with other process participants \(whom themselves modeled their activities points out the basic principle of differentiating RPBBs and information objects is presented in Figure 3 using the Business Process Modeling Notation [30 This fragment depicts the involvement of another collaborating unit within a municipal approval process which the building authority is basically responsible for. This unit participates in the service production by providing a statement. Although specific attributes have been annotated for RPBBs and information objects, they are not visible in the presented view. Examples are the number of pages and medium of information objects as well as communication channel, number of copies, and template support \(cp. Table 5 Documenting 200 real processes of diverse public administrations proved to be very valuable because both, the various issues as well as the perceived advantages of the component-based modeling approach emerged. Most important advantages mentioned by evaluators from public administrations are the standardization and flexibility of process modeling \(consistent levels of detail and generality as well as terminological pre-definitions specifications that enable modeling also for inexperienced people, and the transparent modeling approach \(combination of RPBBs and information objects methodology meets the basic requirements for distributed modeling of collaborative processes discussed in Section 2.1 Perceived issues to be addressed are a lack of awareness about some self-evident activities uncertainties regarding overlapping \(which should have been eliminated to a large extent level of detail which causes relatively high modeling efforts. Issues and advantages have to be considered by further research as the discussed findings only represent perception in the public sector domain  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009

Summary and Outlook  This paper describes the development of a methodology for the domain-independent identification of Reference Process Building Blocks which can be used for distributed modeling in collaborative process environments. Based on an initial evaluation of adaptation mechanisms from the area of reference modeling, suitability of a compositional \(building block-based derived. This contribution describes both the construction as well as the evaluation of the methodology in the public sector where the identified RPBBs have been used exemplarily for modeling of about 200 municipal processes Summarizing, the RPBB-based modeling is considered to be suitable to model collaborative processes in a distributed way. A number of advantages can be exploited from the described component based modeling approach such as the reduction of model heterogeneity and the diffusion of a common understanding \(through standardization of terminology, level of detail and level of abstraction the distributed modeling of process fragments by responsible domain experts as well as the consistent consolidation of the process fragments to complete process models based on their standardized components The actual methodology for RPBB identification provides a valuable basis for targeted users \(cp Section 1 individual domains and purposes. Although this contribution is limited to an analysis of the suitability for the public sector domain, the specified RPBBs can be evaluated for the use in other industries that focus on information management and collaborative service production \(e.g. finance or insurance sectors as well However, the claimed generality of the actual methodology for domain-independent identification of RPBBs has not been proven yet. For that purpose current research is concentrating on applying the methodology to other industries. Due to the collaborative character of medical treatment processes and the highly specialized and distributed knowledge of involved actors, the health care domain was selected for a follow-up project. The expected findings will provide valuable information to improve the methodology described in this paper Further challenges and potential fields for research arose during the evaluation. First, guidance rules should be developed in order to implement capable plausibility and consistency checks not only from a syntactic but especially from a semantic point of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 view [31]. Additional evaluation of the methodology itself \(which is the actual artifact by using the methodology in other domains, in order to refine and complete the design activities. A potential disadvantage identified during evaluation is related to the high level of detail which has to be managed. Although the provided methodology is 


managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
