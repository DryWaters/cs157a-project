  A New Analytical Soluti on of Nonlinear Geodetic Datum Transformation Huaien Zeng*, Qinglin Yi Key Laboratory of Geological Hazards on Three Gorges Reservoir Area, Ministry of Education China Three Gorges University Yichang, People’s Republic of China  Corresponding author: zenghuaien_2003@yahoo.com.cn  Abstract Nonlinear geodetic datum transformation is particular suitable for the case of large rotation angles, and has been an active area of research in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new analytical solution. The method expresses the scale parameter and translation parameters as the function of rotation matrix, through the derivation process. Then, according to the orthogonality of rotation matrix, the method adopts Rodrigues

suitable for the case of large rotation angles, and has been an active area of research in recent years. Many solutions are presented, which can be divided into two categories, namely iterative solution and analytical solution. The former are dominant, e.g., [1  7 Th e m a j o r dif f e r e n c e betw een  th es e  methods embodied in that the rotation matrix is represented differently, which lead to the linearization models are different However, the iterative methods have a drawback of more or less dependence on initial value of parameters. So people need to investigate more efficient analytical method. At present, the relative literature is rarely seen, e.g., [8  p r esen t e d th e  Procrustes algorithm and [9 o p o s e d a qu at ern i on b as ed  algorithm 
In this paper, we will present a new analytical solution Firstly, the principle of least squares is essentially an optimization problem, by taking the partial derivative of the objective function with respect to translation parameters vector and setting it to be zero, we can derive the solution of translation parameters vector which is function of scale parameter and rotation matrix. Secondly, by substituting the solution of translation parameters vector back into the objective problem, and taking the partial derivative of the objective function with respect to scale parameter and setting it to be zero, we can derive the solution of scale parameter which is function of rotation matrix. So the solution of rotation matrix is critical to solving the seven parameters. Thirdly, according to 
the orthogonality of rotation matrix, it can be represented by Rodrigues matrix. Using the relative formula of Rodrigues matrix with anti-symmetric matrix which is formed by a rotation vector, we derive the formula of the rotation vector and the space unit vector in the two datums, further we obtain the analytical solution to the rotation vector. Finally, we obtain the solution of rotation matrix, scale parameter and translation parameters by back substitution step by step Two numerical case studies are demonstrated. one simulates the ideal circumstance, namely the simulative coordinates are noiseless, and the other simulates factual circumstance, namely  the simulative coordinates mixed by 
noise. The two cases both simulate two set of data corresponding to small and large rotation angles. The result shows the proposed method is valid, regardless of whether the coordinates are polluted by noise or not, and whether rotation angles are big or small II  M ATHEMATICS M ODEL OF D ATUM T RANSFORMATION  Usually, 3D datum transformation model uses Bursa-Wolf model, which can be written as [10     i i Rp t s    1 where       2  1   n i z 
y x p Z Y X s T i i i i T i i i i     are two sets of co-located 3D coordinates in two different systems, tagged as system A and B respectively  T tXYZ    denotes three translation parameters  denotes the scale parameter and the 3 3 rotation matrix R  is formed by the three rotation parameters. It is obvious that, in order to solve the seven parameters, the number n of colocated coordinates must be greater than or equal to three Considering the errors of the two sets of co-located 
coordinates, the following observation equations can be got iii Vt Rps    2 According to principle of least squares, i.e 1 min n T ii i VV   3 we can solve the seven parameters Supported by Youth Science Foundation of China Three Gorges University \(Grant No.KJ2009A004\ and Talent Research Start-up Fund of China Three Gorges University \(Grant No.KJ2009B008

So it is critical to solve the rotation matrix R  Bursa-Wolf model, i.e., \(1\ can be rewritten as follows by using the centrobaric coordinates \(namely space vector\orm ii s Rp    10 According to the physical meaning of  i.e ii s p    where the symbol represents the norm of space vector, \(10\ can be transformed as ii s Rp   11 where  iii i ii s ssp pp      are the space unit vectors. Due to the orthogonality of rotation matrix R it can be represented by Rodrigues matrix as follows 1  R IrIr    12 where I denotes the 3 3 identity matrix r is an antisymmetric matrix formed with a rotation vector  x yz vvvv  as 0 0 0 zy z x yx vv rv v vv    13 The following properties between anti-symmetric matrix r  and Rodrigues matrix R are verified  T I rIr  14  T I rIr  15 11  T R RIrIr    16 11  2 Ir IR   17 1 2  T rIR I    18 Substituting \(12\ into \(11\, and using \(16\, \(11\ can be rearranged as   ii I rs Ir p   19 and further we obtain  ii ii rs p s p    20 Denoting ii i s p     ii i s p    and using \(13 20\ can be transformed as 0 0 0 iz iy x ix iz ix y iy iy ix z iz v v v           21 Due to the singularity of anti-symmetric matrix, the rotation vector v is unable to be solved by using \(21\ directly. To solve v more than three control points are required to establish 3n n is the number of control points\ equations like \(21\. Under the principle of least squares, the analytical solution of v is 1  TT v    22 where 11 11 11 00 00 00 T zy nzny zxnznx yx nynx               and 111 T xyz nxnynz        Once v  is solved r is got by using \(13\, and R is obtained by using 12\, then  can be computed by using \(9\nd lastly t is computed by using \(6 Supposing R is formed by rotating angles       counterclockwise around the Cartesian X,  Y and Z axes respectively, then R can be expressed by rotation angles as

Case study 1 considers the ideal circumstance. In this case, the two sets of co-located coordinates have no noise. On the contrary, case study 2 considers the factual circumstance, i.e., the coordinates are mixed with noise A  Case Study 1 The case simulates two sets of data corresponding to small and large rotation angles. Firstly, give the true coordinate values of 1000 co-located points in system B and transformation parameters. Dividing a 900m 900m 900m cube averagely into 1000 100m 100m 100m cubes, we obtain 1000 corners of the small cubes, i.e., the 1000 colocated points, shown in Fig.1. The simulated transformation parameters have two sets, tagged as set 1 and set 2 corresponding small rotation angles and large rotation angles in Table I. Secondly, compute coordinates in system A \(true values\ by using \(1\ Thirdly, solve the transformation parameters \(solved values\ith the previous analytical method using the simulative coordinates of eight corners of the large cube marked with red dot in Fig.1 \(the other points marked with black dot are used for transformation residual calibration of coordinate\stly, verify the correctness of the method by comparing the solved values and true values of the parameters as well as analyzing the transformation residuals. The transformation residuals is the differences between the calculated values and true values of coordinates in system A, of which the former is obtained by substituting coordinates in system B and solved parameters into \(1\ The result is shown in Table II, Fig.2, and Table III. The transformation residuals use all 1000 points  x yzp  in Table III denote RMSE of X, Y, Z axes direction and position, respectively It is seen from Table II, the differences between solved values and true values of seven parameters are very small and negligible whether small or large rotation angle. For set 1 and set 2, Fig. 2 shows that the transformation residuals are both very small and in the same order of magnitude which are intuitively seen in Table III. And we can see that the all residual curves maintain a stable trend overall, and contain a jump per 100 points \(namely, 1 plane\ and a peak per 10 points namely, 1 line\ it indicates that the application effect of transformation parameters closely associated with the spatial location B  Case Study 2 The case obtain the simulative data by adding N\(0, 0.0004 noise to the simulative three dimensional coordinates in the case 1. Namely, the case assumes the errors of coordinate in three axes direction equivalent and independent. Then we can solve the transformation parameters with the proposed method Finally, the result is shown in Table II, Fig.3, and Table III As seen from Table II, for set 1, the errors of solved translation parameters, angle parameters, and scale parameter are in mm, second and 10 6 level; for set 2, the corresponding errors are in cm, ten-second, and 10 6 level. As seen from Fig.3 the transformation residuals are in cm level \(although the transformation parameters are relatively poor for set 2 to those for set 1\, whose specific statistics values are shown in Table III. Thus the solved parameters are both accurate for set 1 and set 2 0 300 600 900 0 300 600 900 0 300 600 900 X Y Z  Figure 1  Spatial distribution of the 1000 control points TABLE I  S IMULATIVE T RUE V ALUES OF T RANSFORMATION P ARAMETERS  Set no X  m Y  m Z  m       Set 1 100 200 300 10 20 30  1.000012436 Set 2 100 200 300 30 60 80  1.000012436

Developing models to match observed data requires realistic models.  Efficiency is gained by the access of the data by models such as of QuakeTables through QuakeSim. Results from the Pattern Informatics method and Virtual California indicate that seismicity and crustal deformation produce detectable patterns that can be used to infer earthquake hazard. Con tinued modeling will indicate patterns of crustal deformation that may be key to improved earthquake forecasting.  Devel oping these prototypes now is important for being prepared to maximize the use of InSAR crustal deformation data from DESDynI and to develop a routine operational data analysis system.  UAVSAR will be a valuable testbed for developing a prototype system for DESDynI, but will also be important for filling in data gaps in response to earthquakes or other events 6  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  We\222d like to thank the many other QuakeSim contributors These include JPL staff members Charles Norton for the adaptive mesh refinement and porting and optimization of software to the Columbia and Cosmos systems, and Margaret Glasscoe for testing the portal using science applications and developing the web pages, and Harout Nazerian for developing the web pages and testing the portal.

managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
