Several missions [4   9  ha ve bee n l a unc he d t o vi si t  t h ese ob ject s  but a comprehensive view of their composition [7  morphology has yet to be undertaken. We propose a unique mission designed to visit a broad spectrum of objects forming a compositional gradient Motivation Based on science objectives derived from the Decadal survey \(2\National Research Council reports \(1\and a NASA Announcement of Opportunity \(AO\tend to answer questions about the orig ins, physical properties, and compositions of Trojans and Centaurs and how the color structure and evolution of thes e objects compare to those of comets. A unique aspect of our mission is the doubleimpactor: two tungsten spheres to be used at Hektor and Oterma to give a glimpse of the subsurface composition which may provide suggestions about the origins of these objects Rather than rely on ground-bas ed or near-Earth telescopes this mission will provide in situ measurements across a broad spectrum of the solarsystem. These objects also provide an accessible source of Kuiper Belt and cometary material without traveling beyond 6 AU. Fundamental properties, the possibility of organic molecules, and the evolution of orbits can only be addressed by sampling the small bodies up close. Results from the mission can be compared with formation scenar ios, such as the Nice Model for consistency and accuracy This mission will significantly advance our understanding of the outer solar system and provides never-before-seen data for several different types of objects.  The instrument suite is robust with proven and reliable science capability and relies upon a well-designed trajectory to visit all of the various bodies. Overall the mission is priced below the budget cap and sized for a medium launch vehicle Mission Heritage Much of the spacecraft heritage stems from other asteroid encounter missions. The impactors in particular are similar in design to the Deep Impact mission [9 a n d t h e com put er  system and software were originally designed for the Mars Science Laboratory. By using parts and designs from previous missions, we have significantly reduced the cost of this mission 2  T ARGET S ELECTION  This mission targets three small bodies: one main belt asteroid, one Jupiter Trojan asteroid and one Centaur asteroid.  The focus of the mission is the science relating to the Trojan asteroid and the Centaur, the main belt asteroid observation is the result of a fortuitous trajectory selection  Little is known about the Trojan asteroids due to the inherent difficulty in observing low albedo objects both small and distant \(~ 4 AU in opposition\ [10  It is kno wn  that these objects lie in the stable L4 and L5 Lagrange points ahead of and behind Jupiter in its orbit 2001 HM10 Mars  Figure 1 A view of the solar syst em including the location of the small-bodies of interest at the time of the Oterma encounter   The two competing theories as to the origin of these bodies are \(1\ bodies formed in the region near Jupiter and were captured into the Lagrange points during Jupiter's growth  2 n aste ro ids were captured from chaotic orbits into their current orbits 3 Little is k nown abou t th e composition of these bodies other than Trojans are composed of generally dark material, thus implying that they could consist of organics.  The chosen Trojan asteroid 624\Hektor is the largest of the Trojan asteroids and is known to have a companion object \(S/2006\ [12  Th e mission will provide compositional data and will verify verifying gravitational and dynamical models of this binary systems. With the expected large population of binary asteroids as well as Kuiper Belt objects in our solar system a greater understanding is needed of their origin and behavior, especially if Jupiter Trojan asteroids originated from further out in the solar system.  By traveling along a trajectory that has an inclination of six degrees to meet Hektor, this mission will additionally collect and analyze dust samples above the ecliptic plane  The mission will culminate with a trip to a 39/P Oterma 1000177\uspected active Ce ntaur, a member of a class of bodies on chaotic orbits stable on the order of 10,000  Oterm a was first di scovered in 1943 as an active body although active outgassing was last seen in 2004 Aside from one object, active Centaurs have been poorly Earth 


  3 studied and never visited Because the Centaur asteroids have dynamically migrated from one of the outer cometary reservoirs \(either the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud\ese objects present a relatively close to Earth opportunity to observe bodies.  Both comets and asteroids are believed to have delivered most of the volatiles to the Earth [14 thus  studying the materials contained within the cores of these objects as well as Centaurs may be key to understanding the organic and volatile material delivered to Earth.  Therefore this impactor mission along with the remote sensing instruments will prov ide unprecedented vi ews of a recently active body beyond Jupiter's orbit 3  S CIENTIFIC I NSTRUMENTS  The science instrumenta tion onboard the SHOTPUT mission contains several observational instruments as well as an in-situ ion mass spectrometer.  The choice of the imaging instruments is leveraged from the success of the Deep Impact mission which obtai ned significant increases in our understanding of cometary bodies.  The addition of a dust analyzer allows for in-situ measurements of the composition of these bodies The primary observational science will be obtained by the high resolution multi spectral imager which will give general topology and mineralogy as well as detection of some volatiles if present.  This instrument covers the 430 to 3000 nanometers \(0.43 to 3 microns\which covers visible light and the near-infrared.  This imager is able to detect OH and H 2 O if present.  The presence of any volatiles on the surface of the Trojan asteroid would raise questions as to the origins of these bodies.  Though the orbit of Jupiter is outside of the frost line where volatiles are found in ice forms, the Trojan asteroids ar e expected to be devoid of volatiles.  These bodies are observed to have very low albedos suggesting that they are covered by carbon compounds 7 The subsurface of these bodies may contain volatiles trapped during their formation.  This would be observable by this imager.  The centaur is expected to contain some volatiles.  Obtaining an inventory of the volatiles on this body will provide information regarding the origins and evolution of the solar system The thermal infrared imager will provide enhanced mineralogy measurements as well as the possibility of imaging the resultant crater floor and determining the pristine materials' composition.  This imager is optimized for determining the mineral composition of these bodies The mineralogy gives information as to the conditions in which these bodies are formed For example this instrument would be able to differentiate between compounds produced in extremely high temperature environments versus those that have been produced in more mild environments.  Since little is known about how both the Trojans and the Centaurs formed, any information may be paradigm changing Navigation cameras onboard will provide stereo images of the body to determine the topology of the body.  It is not clear how solidly these bodies are held together.  Some asteroids are supposed \223rubble piles,\224 which are basically pieces of rock loosely bound and orbiting their respective center of gravity.  If these b odies are in touching each other than they are considered co ntact binaries; the Trojan asteroid target, Hektor, supposedly has a binary that may be a contact binary. Investigating the topology of the body will give information as to the crat ering of the surface as well as any weathering processes that are visible  SHOTPUT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES Measurement MSI RSE TIS DSIMS UVIS Mass of bodies \(and binaries, if possible x x    Topography x     Measure fundamental properties Surface and subsurface thermophysics   x   Organic composition of volatiles and dust from ejecta    x x Organic composition of surface/s ubsurface \(as ejecta x  x  x Chemical and physical com p osition Characterize organic components Organic composition of dust    x x Measure stable isotope ratios of hydrogen     x Measure stable isotope ratios of C, N, O    x  Selected mineralogical compositi on of surface/subsurface x  x  x Bulk chemistry of surface x  x x x Density x    Where in the solar system did these bodies originate Ice presence and abundance x  x   Morphology \226 e.g., has the object experienced jetting x     Determine degree of activity, outgassing rate x  x  x Presence of volatiles surrounding object    x x Has dynamical migration occurred Relationship between body, binary, and satellites x x x   Degree of weathering that has occurred x    x Morphology of surface x     Selected mineralogical compositi on of surface/subsurface x  x  x  Origin and evolution What evolutionary processes have Bulk chemistry of surface and subsurface x  x x x

This measurement will be obtained by viewing a known star before looking through the plume and after and comparing the spectra produced Any absorption within this spectrum will give information about the composition of the plume material.  In many cases volatiles can be observed by UV stellar occultations and with this instrumentation isotope ratios of these volatiles can be obtained.  The measurement of the isotopic ratio of volatiles in these bodies has implications for the origin of the solar system.  The D/H ratio in water ices can specifically place a range on th e location of the formation of the ices in the context of several models 8 Table 1 below provides the science traceability matrix based on the goals and investigations for this mission 4  M ISSION AND T RAJECTORY  One of the scientific goals of the SHOTPUT mission is to acquire a compositional gradient of small body objects in our solar system. By utilizing a unique and innovative trajectory, the mission will capture information about a main-belt asteroid, a Jupiter Trojan and a Trans-Neptunian Centaur. In addition, the Trojan is a suspected contact binary with companion while the Centaur is possibly active No previous mission has visited such a diverse selection of targets let alone return so much data Launch and Early Mission On March 27, 2015, a unique launch opportunity exists that allows completion of this complex and exciting mission Onboard an Atlas V 531, SHOTPUT will launch from the Kennedy Space Center with an initial C3 of 51.4 km 2 s 2  This initial traject ory will send the spacecraft away from Earth and towards deep space. Along the way we will encounter 2001 HM10, a main belt asteroid on January 13 2016 Later that year, on June 14, 2016, the spacecraft will perform a deep space maneuver to return to Earth for a powered flyby. The spacecraft will pass within 300 km of Earth on May 17, 2018 and gain the inclination change needed. Upon leaving Earth orbit, the spacecraft will briefly flyby the Moon. These two bodies will serve as calibration 


  5 points for the instruments and cameras onboard SHOTPUT Trajectory and Cruise The majority of the seven year mission will take place in a cruise phase. On March 25, 2020, SHOTPUT will encounter the Jupiter Trojan Hektor \(a suspected contact binary\nd its companion S/2006. Directly after this encounter a deep space maneuver will be performed to align the spacecraft trajectory for the Ot erma Encounter On October 30  2022, the possibly active trans-Neptunian object Oterma will be encountered Encounter Strategy There are three primar y encounters taking place during this mission, one each for 2001 HM10, Hektor and Oterma The 2001 HM10 encounter will be a calibration test for the instruments before passing near the primary targets, Hektor and Oterma. The vehicle will enter an approach mode approximately 4 days or 3 million kilometers away. The imager will turn on for 4 hours per day and instrument checkout will continue \(checkout begins two weeks out During Far Encounter Mode, 3 days out, the IR imager turns on and the dust analyzer will be continuously. Radio science will begin and continuously collect data  Figure 2 Mission Trajectory Close Encounter begins 30 minutes away and 15 thousand kilometers. The TIS and UVIS will be turned on as the spacecraft speeds towards 2001 HM10 at 8.24 km/sec. The closest approach will take place at approximately 900 kilometers with the slewing maneuver described earlier Instruments will then be shut off in the opposite order and time they had been turned on in returning the spacecraft to a cruise mode before its next encounter Science data will be transmitted to Earth for two weeks immediately following each encounter The encounters for Hektor and Oterma are more complicated due to the distance from Earth as well as the impactor science The approach mode will begin approximately 110 million kilometers away or approximately 150 days. Instrument checkout will begin and the imager will be on for 4 hours a day for trajectory correction Far Encounter mode will begin 7 days out with the dust analyzer, continuous radio science and the IR imager. At 6 days out the impactor will release The early release of the impactor will provide an impact approximately 1 hour before the closest approach for imaging and cloud dissipation Hektor will be encountered at 8.2 km/sec and with a closest approach of approximately 700 kilometers. The instruments will again turn off in the opposite order that the turn on sequence is initiated The encounter at Oterma is essentially the same as the Hektor encounter with an approach speed of 9.11 km/sec and closest approach of 800 kilometers.  The approach mode will be entered approximately 34 million kilometers out or about 44 days Post-Mission After October 30 th 2022, the spacecraft will continue to broadcast science data back to Earth for approximately two weeks. Following this time period the spacecraft can be used for deep space science or shut down. Its trajectory will not intersect with Earth until 2037 at which point it is approximately 0.6 AU aw ay posing no hazard 5  S PACECRAFT D ESIGN  The following sections describes the structural, power thermal, propulsion, Altitude Control System \(ACS Computer Data System \(CDS\, software, and telecommunication subsystems design Structures The main structure of the spacecraft bus assumes bearing carbon fiber panels encasing an aluminum honeycomb core 


  6 with additional mounts for the instruments and tanks. The probe, shown in Fig. 3, consists of the probe body, a single propulsion thruster, two solar arrays and a deployable highgain antenna. A close up view of the probe Figure 3 External Structure of SHOTPUT  shown in Fig. 4, include a single oxidizer tank, two fuel tanks, four radiator panels, twelve RCS thrusters, four reaction wheels, three pressurant tanks, the instrument package and impactor, as well as CDS and the backup battery system The high gain antenna has a requirement of maintaining Earth facing during the entire close encounter for both Hektor and Oterma. During this time, the spacecraft rotates 180 degrees so that the instru ments panel faces the asteroid during the close encounter mode The antenna is attached to a single axis gimbal on the end of the deployable boom. The boom length and location is dictated by several requirements: thruster plume impingement,, and maintaining Earth contact during the clos e encounters. The antenna is located such that a portion of the antenna hangs  Figure 4  Internal Structure of SHOTPUT Figure 5 Power Distribution and Assembly over the side with the propulsion thrusters. However, the antenna is placed such that the antenna pattern coming directly from the dish avoids going through the spacecraft ignoring coning\During any planned thruster firings, the antenna would be turned away from the spacecraft to have the back of the dish facing any possible plume impingement The two solar arrays are on the opposing faces of the spacecraft and are each connect ed to the spacecraft by a single-axis gimbal. The arrays will rotate in the same plane as the high gain antenna, since the Sun and the Earth will be in generally the same direction during the science observing portions of the mission. The solar arrays are particularly vulnerable to space debris and will be feathered during the close approach encounter, to reduce footprint exposed Power The power subsystem inherits its design from previous systems used for the MSAP, MSL, and MER missions 


  7 Designed for the farthest enco unter distance at 5.5 AU, the power subsystem is rated Class A/B with a dual string redundancy. The power distribution and assembly is shown in Fig. 5 Two GaAs TJ UltraFlex solar arrays with 29% efficiency and 80% cell packing factor pr ovide power for the majority of the mission. Sized for the ap proach mode, the solar arrays have a combined mass of 115.20 kg and measure 42.59 m 2  providing a total of 546 W EOL; the solar array power draw at the far and close encounter is 2.5kw-hr and 0.5 kw-hr respectively. Two 8-cell Li-Ion batteries measuring 864 Whr each and a 25% maximum discharge provide additional power for the spacecraft, up to 0.32 kW-hr at the far encounter and 0.52 kW-hr during the close encounter. Two backup batteries are available in case of power failure, and overall, the power is compliant with the launch and eclipse requirements. The power re quirement for the various subsystems and phases is shown in Table 3  Table 3 Power Budget  Thermal The spacecraft is designed to handle extreme external temperature while maintaining stable internal temperature in an acceptable range. The high end external temperature occurs around Earth\222s orbit where the spacecr aft has the maximum exposure to the sun\222s radiation. On the other hand, the low-end external te mperature occurs during the Centaur fly by and is less than 1/100 than that of the Earth flyby. The spacecraft can take the advantage of the minimum heat of 287 Watt generated during its operation as the main energy to keep components warm within the acceptable operating temperature Using this approach, the thermal control hardware can be realized entirely with thermal blankets, heaters, and radiators with no moving parts. This increases the system reliability while minimizing the mass and construction cost Twenty layers of thermal blankets are used on the outer layer of spacecraft enclosure to provide insulation that is sufficiently thick to withstan d the Sun\222s radiation near the earth flyby. A radiator with the surface area of 0.45 m 2 is placed outside the spacecraft container for radiating excessive heat throughout the mission to the Trojans and Centaurs. When combined with silver Teflon coating on the radiating surface, the radiator can effectively reflect the Sun\222s radiation with minima l effect on the spacecraft internal temperature. In addition, heaters are used to provide stable temperature control fo r onboard equipment within their operating range and the total maximum heating requirement is approximately 40 W As the spacecraft travels away from the Sun, most components in the spacecraft must be kept warm above their lowest operating temperature limits. Inside the spacecraft all component modules are coated with black paint to increase emissivity. Heaters ar e used sparingly to bring equipment up to operating temperature. Thirty-five heaters are used to keep fuel lines and propulsion tanks above 10 373 C Thirty thermistors are mounte d on various places in the spacecraft and are monitored by the onboard computer to maintain the operating temperature between 10 373 C and 40 373 C. In addition, precision thermal sensors and heaters are used on all instruments containing precision references to assure ultra-stable operating temperature which results in accurate data acquisitions and downlink communications During the entire operation, the spacecraft does not travel exceed 6.8 AU. The solar panels will be operating at the temperature above -147 373 C and requires no extra heating Propulsion The propulsion subsystem is a dual-mode system, driven by the specified mission Delta-V, ACS momentum dumping and the payload limit of 1890 kg for the Atlas 531  rocket The dual-mode system entails a bipropellant main engine and monopropellant reaction control systems \(RCS\d thrust vectoring control \(TVC\hrusters, shown in Fig. 5 N 2 O 4 is used as the bipropellant oxidizer, with N 2 H 4 as the fuel for the monopropellant RCS and TVC thrusters, and helium as the pressurant.

  8 are sized for the launch vehicle capability. The propellant tanks use surface tension propellant management devices As the use of a gimbal system is expensive and risky, the main engine is fixed and utilizes four TVC thrusters; the  Figure 6 RCS and TVC Thruster Architecture RCS thrusters are divided into two branches of six thrusters each branch further divided into two sets of three thrusters as seen in the spacecraft config uration \(Fig. 6\All 12 of the thrusters are used nominally with pure couples; six can be used for degraded redundancy The ACS momentum dump requires 20 kg of propellant and accounting for the mission\222s total Delta-V, storable bipropellant is used, creating an approximate propellant fraction of 30%. Off-the-shelf components are preferred for the dual mode design, and the selective redundancy is appropriate for class A/B missions such as this. The main engine and TVC thrusters are si ngle string, comparable to previous missions such as Galileo. The design of this dual mode propulsion system supports mass growth up to the maximum of the launch vehicle capability as well as the next rocket size up, Atlas V4 1. All components are taken from existing designs, requiring no additional cost or risk for development Attitude Control System \(ACS The attitude control system requirements are driven by the optical cameras during the va rious encounter phases. The objective is to minimize the pixel smear during the close encounter while still having pointing accuracy during far encounters. Four reaction wheels will be set up in a pyramid formation to provide for a single reaction wheel failure The most complicated maneuver for the ACS system is the slew maneuver upon close approach. At the minimum approach distance, SHOTPUT will have to turn very quickly to minimize pixel smear. The reaction wheels are rated for 2000 rpm providing 6.5 deg/min rotation. During slew, the spacecraft will first reverse th e wheels to 2000 rpm and then speed them up 4000 rpm providing 13 deg/min with only three wheels \(in case of a single failure\9 deg/min with all four wheels Computer Data System \(CDS To meet the New Frontiers cost limit, the Computer Data System \(CDS\tilizes the Multi-Mission System Architectural Platform \(MSAP with a heritage from the Mars Science Laboratory \(MSL\pared to Solid State Recorders \(SSR lower in mass, volume, and power consumption, and is chosen to reduce the cost and risk of the mission. The CDS has an estimated data volume of 11.5 Gbits during the mission, and requires four 3-Gbits Non-Volatile Memory \(NVM\s, providing a total of 12 Gbits of storage capacity. The science data are compressed by the individual instruments, and the actual implementation of the data compression is decided by the instrument developers. The data storage requirements for the mass memory are 8.5 Gbits total for science and engineering data storage during close encounter, 1 Gbits for flight software and 2 Gbits for engineering telemetry and margin during post encounter phase

Once the data is retrieved, science data is processed at JPL and then data are categorized into five levels for processing 225  Level 0: Raw telemetry from instruments \(timetagged, quality checked, chronological sequence 225  Level 1: Calibrated instrument data giving the physical parameter actually measured by the sensors 225  Level 2: Calculated from Level 1 data; are related directly to the instrument measurement \223footprint\224 225  Level 3: Smoothed and gridded data; level 2 data transformed into a common format 225  Level 4: Derived Quantities At the same time, data is also sent to the National Space Science Data Center to be st ored and made accessible.

Minimal effort is assumed for the adaptation of these specific MSAP components for this missi on, and efforts will be concentrated on re-testing these mechanisms. It is assumed that the flight software is only responsible for the high-level control of the flight components, with no role in the software components for the individual instruments. There are no data analysis components onboard, and the data is only stored and sent back. All implementations of the flight software are done in-house and fully co-located. The estimated development time is 71.1 work-years, an equivalent of 210.3k lines of code Telecommunication The telecommunication subsystem requires two-way X Band communications throughout the mission. The requirements for downlink data rates using the 34-meter Deep Space Network depend on the separation between the spacecraft and Earth and are listed in Table 4 Distance between the spacecraft and Earth Downlink data rate 3.66 AU 75 kbps 4.5 AU 50 kbps 6.4 AU 25 kbps  Table 4 Requirements for downlink data rates  The command bit error rate \(BER\ired to be 1e-5 and the telemetry frame error rate \(FER\required to be 1e-4 A minimum link margin of 3 db is required in the communication links The pointing error depends on the beamwidth of the antenna and assumes the pointing loss to be less than 1 dB. The high gain antenna \(HGA\is pointed within 0.2 degrees, the medium gain antenna \(MGA\inted within 10 degrees and the low gain antenna \(LGA\inted within 45 degrees.  The design assumes an error correcting 1/6 turbo code with 8920 bit frames for high rate links, and an error correcting 1/6 turbo code with 1784 bit frames for low data rate links The subsystem is a fully redundant X-Band deep space system.  It contains two sm all deep space transponders SDST\or X-Band uplink and downlink \(with single redundancy\There are two traveling wave tube amplifiers TWTA\, each outputting 30 W.  The X-Band high gain antenna is 3-meter parabolic dish with a single axis gimbal and has a gain of 45 db. A medium gain horn with a half power beamwidth \(HPBW\of 20 degrees, and two low gain antennas with a combined HPBW of 90 degrees are operated during safe mode.  The horn and the omni antennas operate at 10 kbps with the 70 meter DSN dish in safe mode. The system has two diplexers which allow the use of a single antenna for both uplink and downlink. The hybrid splits/ combines the signals while the Waveguide Transfer Switch \(WGTS\nd the Coax Switch \(CXS\required for switching the antennas. The total estimated mass of the telecommunication subsystem is 51.3 kg, with a peak transmit power of 64 W and a minimum \(receiver on\r of 12 W 6.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
