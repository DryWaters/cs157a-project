  1 Thrust Production Mechanisms in Hollow Cathode Microthrusters  A. N. Grubisic and S. B. Gabriel University of Southampton Highfield, Southampton, SO17 1ST, United Kingdom 44 \(0 A.Grubisic@soton.ac.uk   Abstract \227 Hollow cathode have recently been investigated at the University of Southampton as potential standalone microthrusters 12 Thrust measurements suggest that in some cases, hollow cathodes are able to generate specific impulse 
of over 1000s with xenon. The means by which hollow cathodes are able to generate such high levels of specific impulse is not clearly understood. This paper explores thrust production mechanisms in the T5, T6 and XIPS hollow cathodes based on thrust performance and ion energy measurements. Analysis suggests the total thrust produced includes components of gas dynamic thrust particularly as a result of an intense electron pressure at the cathode exit, but also shows evidence for magneto-hydro-dynamic \(MHD forces at high currents and low flow rates arising from the self-induced azimuthal magnetic field within the orifice and 
resulting cross-field interaction plasma. Data may also suggest ion acceleration due to plasma potential hills. While this initial characterization can only loosely attribute the relative magnitude each mechanism plays it does show evidence for each. This research shows that with further development based on an understanding of the thrust mechanism, hollow cathodes thrusters could present significant refinements to the technology of electric propulsion T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1

  2  1  I NTRODUCTION  Within the University of Southampton there has been an ongoing research effort to develop the T5 and T6 hollow cathodes \(HC\ for use as standalone microthrusters. The cathode test articles are a mature technology developed extensively over the last 35-years for application on the UK-10, UK-25, T5 and T6 gridded ion thrusters 1  2  3  4  5  6  and as an electron source for various ion beam neutralization applications 7 Recent experiments on a T6 discharge cathode a by Gessini t the University of Southampton found that practical thrust could be generated with reasonable specific impulse \(up to 500s 8  9  10 Such performance strengthened interest in the use of all-electric propulsion systems composing high specific impulse primary electric propulsion augmented by a HC microthruster reaction control system \(RCS 11  12 For some missions such a configuration presents considerable mass savings over configurations where the attitude and orbit control system \(AOCS\compos es both a chemical RCS and primary electric system, primarily through the sharing of a common propellant bus and power processing subsystems but also through the potentially high specific impulse of the RCS. While secondary chemical RCS systems constitute a relatively large fraction of the overall propulsion system mass 13  14  15  16 these systems also bring substantial expenditure in manufacture, assembly, integration, testing and launch preparation due to the use of hazardous propellants 17 General attempts to scale down electrostatic and electromagnetic thrusters fo r such a role have however yielded relatively poor performance 18 primarily due to high wall losses from the higher surface area to volume ratios and call for a more adequate solution. The work of Gessini 19  also highlighted very low thrust efficiency, which dropped well below 1%, particularly at higher values of specific impulse, leading to requirements comparable to primary propulsion systems \(>600W\low cathodes are to have a realistic application they must be developed to show higher thrust efficien cies and at least be able to contend with resistojets in terms of their performance \(15-48s with xenon 20  21 while operating in the 20-50W power range Figure 1 shows the general thrust to power ratios position of electric thrusters and the curre nt position of HC thrusters based on the work of Gessini  Since the means by which hollow cathodes are able to generate such high levels of specific impulse is not understood the method by which to improve performance of is not clear. This work therefore aims to understand the influence of terminal parameters of discharge current, mass flowrate and cathode geometry on discharge characteristics and thrust production mechanisms in hollow cathodes and in doing so develop means to improve performance. It is clear that in order to be competitive with conventional propulsion systems HC thrusters must be able to show thrust to power ratios ~1W/mN and >100s to be competitive with resistojets and ~10W/mN with >250s to compete with colloid thrusters and DC arcjets and demonstrate efficiencies of at least 20   Figure 1 Thruster capability based on thrust to power ratio, specific im pulse and efficiency In order to characterize thrus performance of various cathode and indirect pendulum micro-thrust balance and supporting architecture based on a laser optical lever was consdructed 22 The T6 and later the T5 cathodes were then characterized in a number of different geometrical configurations with subs equent design iterations 23 24  25  Finally, in an attempt to understand the relationship between the existence of high energy ion populations in hollow cathode discharges and the likely thrust production mechanisms, ion energy measurements were conducted at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory on a \274 inch XIPS cathode with a similar geometrical configuration to the most refined T6 cathode design 26 This paper will present a review of the thruster design philosophy and analysis of experimental results 2  H OLLOW C ATHODE T HRUSTER D ESIGN  A full and detailed review of the operation of hollow cathodes is given in 23,24,25 In our case we will cover design of the anode assembly since anode design was judged as key in increasing hollow cathode thruster efficiency by controlling the spot to plume mode transition point Understanding of the thermal flux to the anode was also necessary in to prevent ove rheating of the thruster assembly  A  Power Balance  A schematic of the energy flux within a cathode is shown in Figure 2. The electron or ion temperature in volts is given by

If the flux of ions into the cathode-anode gap is sufficient the anode will passively collect the discharge current fro m the plasma; this type of operation is referred to as spot mode. If the ion flux to the cathode-keeper gap is insufficient for the anode to passively collect the electron current, an additional sheath and voltage drop forms between the plasma and anode to facilitate ionization and electron transport/collection so that electrons can traverse the gap within th e quasi-neutral plasma. This transition, depicted in Figure 3 occurs as the mass flow rate or discharge current is decreased \(both of which intrinsically influence plasma and discharge properties beyond a critical point and is generally termed plume mode given that the bright spot at the cathode tip transitions into a more diffuse-like plume. Since the ions created in the gap have some fraction of the discharge potential to accelerate them toward the cathode plume mode is particularly associated with ion sputtering of the cathode orifice 29 and discharge instabilities, which limit lifetime 30 and are responsible for high coupling voltages. For these reasons cathodes are normally operated in spot mode   Figure 3 Hollow cathode discharge behavior with varying current and flowrate  The significant increase in disc harge voltage distinctive of plume mode also significantly increases the discharge power for a fixed discharge current based on the 212  r e eq e eq D s e es i ii q e kT I e kT II dA e kT JdA e kT J

If th e passive current exceeds the discharge current the keeper will be negative relative to its local plasma potential in order to achieve current balance. In this condition relatively little el ectron acceleration occurs in the cathode keeper gap in order to give the necessary excitation/ionization to carry the discharge current and spot mode is maintained. If the passive current is insufficient to provide the discharge current demanded from the power supply, remembering that the power supply is operating in a current limited mode, the keeper potential must be positive with respect to its local pl asma potential forming an area enhancing sheath and causing electron acceleration towards the keeper with an associated glow in the cathode keeper region  The efficiency of ionization within the cathode in spot mode is hypothesized to be sufficient to emit ions to neutralize the plasma in the cathode-to-keeper gap. Hence, the discharge fails to exhibit visual ev idence of electron-impact ionization. In contrast, plume-mode emission exhibits both a luminous plume downstream of the cathode and large current and voltage oscillations typically at several megahertz  C  Current Collection Analytical Model  From this understanding of hollow cathode operation we can state that in order to improve the thrust efficiency above that currently demonstrated it is likely that we can  1  Extend the range of spot mode operation by increasing the available anode contact for electron collection from the plasma and maintaining passive discharge current collecti on at the anode surface This will also 2  Lower discharge voltage for the same demanded current thus incr easing efficiency 3  Enable operation at higher specific powers giving higher specific impulse  Assuming a quazi-neutral plasma, the plasma density n i  can be calculated by assuming the flowrate equals the thermal efflux through the orifice cross section, i.e assuming the drift velocity is equal to the thermal random velocity in the direction of the outlet with net flux equal to the propellant flow rate. Ion mass and temperatures are used for calculation of the plasma density since ions have much lower mobility and thus will drive the density function. At the outlet where a sudden change in plasma density is expected, this can serve as a first approximation   21 0 2 007  15 Pottinger 33 conducted optical probe studies on the T6 hollow cathode at various positi ons along the emitter length For a cathode operated at 5A discharge current at 1.1mg/s mass flow rate of argon, probes positioned at 2.7mm upstream and 1.1mm upstream of the cathode orifice determined electron temperatur e to be ~0.6eV and ~1.0eV respectively. Electron temperature did not vary significantly for discharge currents between 2A to 10A. These measurements show good agreement with the spectroscopic measurements of Malik 34   The ionization fraction has been shown to approach unity with the orifice of hollow cathodes however, even if the T5 HC approaches full ionization at very high levels of orifice current density the propellant mass utilization through the  dAJJI eiA  12 Thus for a cylindrical anode  aaieie LdJI 006    13 ieA III   14 Thus for a cathode to operate in spot mode with sufficient passive current collection  AD II   9 Since the thrust mechanis m, be it electrothermal electromagnetic or electrostatic will be principally a function of the discharge current rather than the discharge voltage, one understandable way to increase thrust efficiency is to decrease th e operating voltage. In addition the extension of spot mode like operation will inevitably enable operation at lower mass flowrates and higher specific powers \(J/mg\pulse  An empirical transition to spot mode criterion 31 has been described by Kaufman, whic h accurately predicted the transition flow rate. Mandel and Katz 32 have numerically determined this transition on the basis of the contact area of the anode and keeper electrode with the downstream plasma. Assuming a quazi-neutral plasma, the passive flux of electrons and ions to a keep er electrode immersed in the downstream plasma, based on thermal flux, is given by  ie ie ekie m eT nAI    2 


  5 keeper orifice does not, in general, exceed 10 35  36 This latter parameter is defined as the ratio of extracted ion current over the equivalent current of 100% singly-ionized xenon. Such a discrepancy is likely caused by the fact that most ions of the ions created in the cathode orifice are neutralized before they can escape through the keeper orifice 35 even though it is located ~2mm downstream of the cathode  Inside the cathode, and even more so in the expanding plume, the electron temperature Te is much lower than the first ionization potential for xenon 12.13eV\Recombination of ions and electrons within the emitted plasma is thus bound to be significant 37   Gessini clearly noted a transition to plume mode at flow rates below 0.5mg/s with 5Amps discharge current on argon at which thrust noise, discharge noise and voltage were shown to sharply increase as shown in Figure 4   Figure 4 Transition from spot to plume mode at decreasing cathode flow rate with argon at 5A 38   Using the value of electron temperature of 1eV close to the orifice and the analytical model described previously along with the geometrical configuration of Gessini\222s anode, the required plasma density for plume mode transition at 5Amps with 0.5mg/s argon for the T6 cathode, as shown in Figure 4, can be evaluated. Gessini used a cylindrical anode of 10mm diameter and 10mm length. The ionization fraction required to satisfy the passive current condition of 5A at the anode surface based on electron and ion temperature is shown in Figure 5. Since there are no direct measurements of ion temperature at this condition yet it strongly influences plasma density, the ionization fractions for ion temperatures of 0.1eV, 0.2eV, 0.4eV and 0.8eV are calculated, corresponding to heavy particle temperatures of 1160K, 2321K, 4642K and 9284K respectively   Figure 5 Calculated ionization fraction required to match empirical observations of Gessini for transition to plume mode at 5A and 0.5mg/s with a circular anode of 10mm diameter and 10mm length at respective electron and ion temperatures  Interestingly, increased i on temperature, while being important for the electrothermal thrust production mechanism, serves to lower the plasma density for a particular anode by increasing ion velocity and thus decreases J e thus the theoretical ionization fraction required to give spot mode increases. While ion temperature has a strong influence on the plasma density ion flux to the anode remains negligible in terms of constituting discharge current, as shown in Figure 6, given the low ion mobility Electron temperature on the other hand does have a strong influence on the total discharge current and the current collection process   Figure 6 Passive ion current for changing ion and electron temperatures  The increase in ion current with decreasing electron temperature comes about by the increase in the required ionization fraction to give the 5Amps of passive discharge current. The ionization fraction bares the relation 


  6  5.0 b e i A D T T A I 005 so does the anodes capacity to passively collect current from the plasma. Measurements by Goebel 40 shown in Figure 7 confirmed by the plasma models of Mikellides 39 have shown that plasma density can decrease by nearly two orders of magnitude only 8mm downstream of the orifice in the NSTAR discharge cathode. The NSTAR cathode in this case is a very useful comparison since the cathode orifice is of identical diameter to the T6 cathode used in our both our experiments and previous HCT experiments by Gessini on which our model is based   Figure 7 Plasma density falloff downstream of the cathode orifice in the 0.635cm NSTAR discharge cathode with a 1mm orifice. TH8 and TH15 correspond to discharge currents of 8.6Amps and 14.1Amps respectively 40   The plasma densities calculated by our model for Gessini\222s anode match closely with the observed plasma densities found 10mm downstream of the NSTAR cathode, in this case between 2.17-2.65x10 13 cm 3 for electron temperatures between 0.8-1.2eV respectively. This data confirms that, at least in this case, the anal ytical model is an accurate predictor of plume mode transition and strengthens the hypothesis that the plume mode transition occurs when I D  I A These data suggest that the most effective design of anode for maintenance of spot mode in HCTs may therefore be one which presents as greater area - plasma density product as possible. These two requirements are somewhat contradictory since, for instan ce, increasing the diameter of a cylindrical anode while increasing the available contact area also increases the path le ngth for electrons and ions to traverse from the orifice, and as we have seen, ion recombination occurs quickly as the plasma exits the orifice thus plasma density significantly drops. The problem of optimizing geometry may therefore be a complex one based on maximizing passive current collected for a range of operating conditions in which plasma density, ionization fraction, electron and ion temperature will vary as a complex function of the discharge current. Such optimization would require a significant modeling effort Minimum anode geometry was thus calculated for a constant ionization fraction of 10% based on the measurements of Crofton for a maximum current of 25Amps. Mikellides presented a model of the geometrically similar NSTAR discharge cathode operating at 25A on 5sccm of xenon \(0.35mg/s\ed a maximum heavy particle temperature of 2640K or 0.227eV which we used as the ion temperature. Pottinger extensively characterized the internal plasma of the hollow cathode with xenon and recorded electron temperatures of ~1.0eV at the orifice entrance at 25A which we used as our electron temperature T e A conical anode with a 30\260 divergent nozzle, as shown in Figure 8, was selected to as to satisfy the analytical model for the collection of a 25Amp passive current. The geometry of th is particular anode became known as the T6 LA \(large anode\he highest specific impulse of all anode designs although various other anodes were built to explore discharge characteristics   Figure 8 Schematic of the hollow cathode anode configuration  D  Thermal Model of Anode Heating    In anode design we must also consider heat dissipation and cooling of the anode. Since we want to avoid having to cool the anode actively here we w ill assume that the anode can only be cooled by conduction to the anode mountings and radiation to the vacuum. We have already described the power balance within the hollow cathode plasma.In this case the integrals of J i and J e are over the cathode and anode area in contact with the plasma The energy absorbed by the anode from collection of the discharge current, ion recombination and radiative h eat transfer from the plasma and cathode is given by  005  16 Since T i T e and the attained ionization fraction are largely functions of the cathode operating regime the most obvious way to increase the maximum passive current a cathode is capable of carrying is by increasing the available anode area to enhance electron collecting area. However, as suggested plasma density significantly decreases downstream of the orifice \(due to decreasing 


 2 5 2 5  n 4 2 5 2 5  n is the view factor from the anode unit area to all other anode surfaces r q is the radiative flux from the plasma to the anode and q c is the radiative flux from the high temperature cathode body to the anode. This is in fact an over-simplification of the problem since there are many other important heat transfer routes not defined here such as the radiative and conductive transfer from the anode assembly to the cathode and supporting structure. Even so the evaluation of this problem to achieve a steady state solution is extremely mathematically challenging given the calculation of view factors, ch anges in thermal gradients the fact that the analysis is an open radiation system with heat transfer to internal surfaces and as well as ambient vacuum. The evaluation of the q c component is also an extremely complex problem In this case the thermal analysis tool COSMOS Flow Works was employed used for the calculation of steady state anode and assembly temperature. In order to ev aluate the problem heat flux parameters had to be de fined which from Equation 19 requires discharge current, electron temperature, ion current and ion temperature as well as the current distribution with respect to anode area. Since we are in this case building a thermal model and not a plasma model we assume that electrons are collected over th e entire surface of the anode with constant J e  for each anode. In reality this will vary with the plasma density and thus the anode will receive differential heat input however since the anode will have a high degree of conductivity and will be relatively small in size, the peak anode temperature should not be substantially different from the mean anode temperature. Previous assumptions of electron temper ature, ion temperature and ionization fraction for operation at 25Amps are used as in the previous analytical mode l. The output of the thermal model used to ensure the anode and assembly temperature was sufficiently cool is shown in Figure 9   Figure 9 T6 Hollow cathode thruster assembly thermal model operating at 25A with argon on 0.05mgs 1  3  T HRUST M EASUREMENT D ATA   Various other geometrical configurations of thruster have been tested based on the configuration of the anode. Anode geometry was modified in order to establish the effect of plasma/anode contact area on the basis that this parameter has a strong influence on the transition of the cathode to plume type operation. Thrust characterization of the T5FO and the T6LA has been described by the author in previous papers 23,24,25 along with the laser optical lever thrust measurement system used 41   A  Thrust characteristics of the T5FO  Figure 5 shows levels of specific impulse attained in a discharge mode. In a discharge mode results show near monotonic dependence of specific impulse on discharge current with rapidly increasing performance below 0.4mgs 1  for the 3.2A and 1.6A throttle settings with a less pronounced increase at 0.8A. Since a change in flow rate results in a change in operating voltage it specific impulse can be correlated with specific power of the flow \(J.mg 1  Figure 10 shows the influence of mass flowrate on specific impulse with Figure 11 showing the relationship between specific power and specific impulse for the T5 cathode    7 crA e eA i ii qqdA e kT JdA e kT J 003  18 In this case this energy will be rejected radiatively following the Stefan-Boltzmann law and conductively following Fourier\222s law, thus  t  004\003 003  19 Where AA f     AAA AAAAA crA e eA i ii dATTCdAfTT qqdA e kT JdA e kT J

At the high current condition operation at powers of below 30W give specific impulse in the region of 250s. Further reduction in flow rate increases operating voltage and power invested in the flow. This results in an increase in specific impulse however with declining thrust efficiency as convective and radiative losses begin to dominate  B  Thrust characteristics of the T6LA  Figure 12 shows that in the T6LA achieving high specific impulse is dependent on discharge current since higher discharge currents are able to sustain operation at lower mass flow rates. Operation with xenon also gives high specific impulse although only at very low flowrates. This is testament to the lower primary ionization energy of xenon which enabled the cathode to operate at the lowest flow rate of 0.04mgs 1   Unlike the case of the T5 cathode, the T6 cathode shows relatively little improvement in specific impulse at higher currents indicating that resistive dissipation plays a much smaller role in thrust production, which is reasonable due to the large orifice of the T6 cathode. It is worth noting that at maximum current rated capacity, the current density in the T5 cathode is 65A.mm 2 compared to the T6 cathode at 38A.mm 2 which, assuming an electrothermal acceleration mechanism, would suggest the reason for such larger relative changes in specific impulse of the T5 at higher currents   Figure 12 Specific impulse reached with the modified T6 hollow cathode at various current conditions and mass flow rates with xenon and argon  Figure 13 Relationship betw een specific impulse and specific power for the T6 at various current levels with xenon and argon  Figure 13 shows two distinct gradients in the relationship between specific power and sp ecific impulse which differ substantially from the T5 results. For operation with argon specific impulse is almost iden tical for low specific powers however approaching 5000J.mg 1 there is a change in 


  9 gradient. It is postulated that this change in gradient is also a change in dominant thrust mechanism, with electromagnetic acceleration becoming the dominant since flow rates above 5000J.mg 1 are very low and would contribute an increasingly small degree of electrothermal thrust. This hypothesis is strengthened when considering thrust level with respect to mass flow rate as in Figure 14   Figure 14 T6 thrust level with respect to mass flow rate at various current conditions with xenon and argon  It is clear that when extrapol ating thrust level back to zero mass flow a remnant thrust production mechanism exists which scales with discharge current. The thrust measurement with the heavier xenon propellant however has different characteristics to operation with argon. Above 0.25mgs 1 thrust scales almost linearly with mass flowrate however at below 0.25mgs 1 the thrust measurement moves the intercept close to that of argon at the same current level  C  Anode Geometry Investigations  In an attempt to both understand thrust production and to improve efficiency, anode geometry was modified, as previously mentioned, to enable operation at lower flowrates and also reduce discharge voltage to improve efficiency. Anode geometry was shown to have a significant influence on both the point of transition to plume mode and also the discharge voltage when operating at a specific discharge current and mass flow rate. The operating voltages of the T5 cathode with argon for both forms of anode are shown in Figure 15.  With the larger anode and at low mass flowrates the discharge voltage is shown to be 810V below that of an orificed flat plate anode. In this case due to mass flow meter limitations, the larger anode was only operated below 0.4mg/s.  Nonetheless, at the 3.2Amp current condition the conical anode reduces discharge voltage from 34.57V for the flat plate to 19.35V, a reduction of 15.22V. This increases discharge efficiency by 44% and also substantially influences noise generation   Figure 15 T5 voltage characteristics when operating in a T5FP and T5CA configuration on argon  With a flat plate anode the cathode gradually enters plume mode as flow rate is reduced below 0.25mg/s however using a CA type configuration maintains spot mode like operation to much lower flowrates, only entering plume mode at the reduction of flow rate to extreme levels close to the extinguishing flowrate. Figure 16 shows the T5CA operating in an almost noise free DC discharge when operating on only 0.05mg/s of argon. Further reduction to 0.03mg/s however results in substantial noise generation primarily < 5MHz but also extending beyond 120MHz as shown in Figure 17  Figure 16 Noise measurements from a T5CA operating on 0.05mg/s argon at 3.2 Amps 


  10  Figure 17 Noise measurements from a T5CA operating on 0.03mg/s argon at 3.2 Amps  Similar behavior, shown in Figure 18, is found in operation of the T6VLA cathode however transition in this case occurs at an order of magnitude higher flowrates than the T5CA cathode  Figure 18 Noise measurements from the T6VLA operating at 0.2mg/s and 0.1mg/s on argon at 25Amps  With both the T5 and T6 cathodes, transition to plume mode transition occurs at increasingly higher flowrates with decreasing discharge currents. Anode type also has a pronounced effect on this trans ition point with respect to mass flowrate however at the time of writing this data is still being collected. Voltage data highlighting the abruptness of the change to plume mode is shown in Figure 19. This data was taken at 5Amps with a change in flowrate from 1.5mg/s to 1.45mg/s and back again. The cathode initially shows very little noise, however on decreasing mass flowrate the cathode very quickly establishe s a transition to a slightly higher operating voltage \(1-2V unstable\ with significant noise generation and peak to peak voltages in excess of 9V   Figure 19 Voltage characteristics of a transition to plume mode at 5Amps on argon between 1.5mg/s 1.45mg/s and back again  D  Anode Heat Flux  Due to the convective heat flux of electrons, particularly in the case of the T6 cathode which operates at much higher currents, anode temperatures can be in excess of 2500K The ability of the anode to ra diatively dissipate heat flux determines the maximum current any particular anode configuration is able to operate at. In addition smaller anodes result in larger operating voltages which also results in increased heat flux since el ectrons are of higher energy due to the additional voltage drop which results in an increase in electron temperatur e. Voltage characteristics of the T6SA and T6VLA shown in Figure 20. The maximum current for the T6SA was 17.5A at higher flowrates and 12.5A at lower flowrates as opposed to the T6MA, T6LA and T6VLA which were able to    Figure 20 T6VLA operating at 25A, 0.1mg/s \(top\6 SA operating at 12.5A, 0.1mg/s \(bottom 


007  20  When considering thermalization of the propellant to produce thrust with xenon, krypton or argon, the theoretical limit to specific impulse \(assuming full conversion of thermal to directed kinetic energy\s shown in Figure 21   Figure 21 Limiting specific impulse for purely thermalized propellants based on full energy conversion  An electrothermal thrust mechan ism is sufficient to explain specific impulse <250s found in the T5 cathode at flowrates above 0.2mg/s which would require propellant temperatures 6000K. However at flowrates below this it is not easy to conceive of heavy particle temperatures >16,000K required for specific impulse up to 450s. As flowrate is reduced further it is however conceivable that the ionisation fraction increases considerably, thus so does plasma density. It is also conceivable that elect ron temperature increases significantly with reduced mass flowrate as the cathode is forced to operate at higher voltages in order to sustain operation. In this case there is an increasingly significant additional component of pressure thrust at the orifice exit Assuming the propellant leaves the cathode at the chocked flow velocity and no form of nozzle is included downstream of the orifice, the thrust contribution at the orifice exit will thus consist of components of momentum and pressure thrust at the orifice exit given by    11 D ISCUSSION   A  Thrust Mechanisms  Plasma models suggest that cathodes are capable of generating peak heavy particle temperatures greater than 6,000K with wall temperature not exceeding 1,500K 42  Laser Induced Fluorescence \(LIF\has identified neutral temperatures in cathode-keeper gaps are between 18004000K, well above cathode wall temperature 43 Experiment has also suggested heavy particle temperatures between 3200-6000K necessary to explai n elevated backpressures within conventional cathodes 44 Assuming the plasma and remaining neutrals undergo some degree of adiabatic expansion it is reasonable to assume some level of thermal energy conversion to directed kinetic energy of the flow which is dependent on the plasma heating modes. The main mechanism of plasma heating is known to be Ohmic heating by plasma electrons within the cathode orifice with collisional heat transfer to the heavy particles 45 A thermal thrust mechanism with significant arc heating within the cathode would be possible while low wall temperatures are maintained \(<1700K\low plasma densities contacting the orifice \(~10 20 m 3  46 The electron temperature within the orifice is typically 11,600-23,200K \(1-2eV depending on the degree of Ohmic heating. The performance of any electrothermal device can be approximated by means of a rudimentary one-dimensional energy argument that limits th e exhaust speed of the flow from a fully expanded nozzle to  propp ex TCv   212  200 o 1 013\005 013\005  21 In this case is can be seen that this additional component of thrust when considering modera te electron temperatures and ionization fractions can account for the high values of specific impulse found when operating the T5FO cathode In addition, transient thrust measurements made as the cathode is switched off, shown in Figure 22, indicates a significant backpressure component is removed within the cathode. As the cathode is switched off there is a significant increase in thrust, between 40-50% of the discharge thrust level, which gradually decreases to a level consistent with the hot gas thrust. As the mass flow is then switched off the thrust level reduces to zero. The rate of decrease in thrust at both points in time is equal indicating that the reduction in thrust immediately after the th rust increase at switch-off is also due to expulsion of an upstream pressure buildup within the cathode and feed lines   Figure 22 Thrust measurement as the cathode discharge    nniieer nxe ixe kTnkTnkTnA TR TRmF 


  4 3 ln 4 2 c A z r r J F   12 is switched off at t=23s with constant upstream mass flowrate followed by the mass flow being turned off at t=115s. The cathode is operating at 3.2A with 2mg/s xenon As a first approximation, assuming that all particles behave like a perfect dilute gas, the plasma pressure in the hollow cathode orifice can be evaluated from the equation of state  nniieer kTnkTnkTnp  11 2 1 1 212\212 006 265  24  The resulting particle velocity assuming a fully ionized gas is shown in Figure 23   Figure 23 Theoretical ion energies from the Maecker formula as a result of the cross field interaction from a self-generated azimuthal magnetic field for krypton and xenon acting on a fully ionized mass flow Assuming a bulk accelerating force acts on the total mass flowrate it can be seen that the resulting accelerating force per particle is significant. One important factor considered in MPDT\222s type operation is the exceeding of the critical ionization current. Assuming MP DT theory can serve as a first approximation, it can be shown that if flow rates are low enough the ratios of discharge current I to the critical ionization current I ci also becomes significant. A key scaling parameter of interest is the ratio of the discharge current to \(also known as the full ionization current 48  49  50  Parameters such as the thrust and voltage have been seen to strongly correlate with in MPDTs. The plasma is considered partially ionized at I<I ci  and fully ionized for I>I ci At I=I ci  1\e electromagnetic thrust is equal to the product of the mass flow rate and the propellant Alfven critical ionization velocity. The parameter is given by Eqn.\(17\ is given by Eqn.\(18   o  22 Considering the small orifice area compared to the cross sectional area of the internal diameter of the cathode, the internal pressure may, as a first approximation, be estimated from the critical flow relation for sonic flow through the orifice, assumed to be adiabatic  212  013 013 or ins pp  23 In this case it can be seen that a reduction in orifice plasma pressure backpressure would cau se an increase in mass flow due to an increased pressure difference. Since the mass flow into the feed lines and cathode is constant this pressure difference would eventually re duce to the critical pressure ratio for a choked orifice as the upstream pressure diminishes which can be cl early seen in Figure 22   E  T6 Hollow Cathode Thru ster with Large Anode T6LA  Accounting for the specific impulse found from the T6LA also requires heavy particle temperatures too high to be described by a thermal thrust mechanism alone. Unlike the T5FO, the T6LA may experience a degree of electromagnetic acceleration of the charged particles by Lorenz forces in the plasma, which is reasonable above 25 Amps. The T5FO cathode however operates at much lower currents and therefore is expect ed to operate in an almost purely electrothermal mode  A T6 cathode with of 0.75mm orifice diameter orifice at 30Amps would give a current density of 6.8 x 10 7 A/m 2  Assuming that the plasma does not pinch, the magnetic field at the edge of the orifice is would be considerable at 160 Gauss and higher if the plasma is assumed to pinch. If a strong self-induced magnetic field exists within the orifice it may be sensible to suggest the possibility of magnetohydro-dynamic acceleration of the plasma  The Maecker formula has been used to approximate the thrust scaling of self-fi eld magneto-plasma-dynamic thrusters \(MPDTs\ the total current. The formula has been shown to be too simplistic to account for the trends in measured thrust data at low current due to the scaling of gas dynamic pressure distributions induced by the pinching components of the volumetric electromagnetic forces 47  However in this case it can be used as an approximation of the significance of the EM force alone  A stream wise acceleration could be provided by the crossing of the radial arc current J with the self generated azimuthal magnetic field through the cathode orifice, an essentially scalar crossed-field interaction with an anode and cathode radius ra and rc given by

This data can be seen in the transient thrust measurement in Figure 25   Figure 25 Transient thrust measurement as T6LA is switched on at t=22, off at t-47 and the mass flow is switched off at t=70. Cathode is operated at 25Amps with 0.2mg/s argon  As seen above the additional thrust component appears almost instantaneously \(with some delay due to the inertia of the target thrust balance\he discharge is switched on and removed instantaneously as the discharge is extinguished. As the mass flow is switched off however a characteristic transient is seen as the cathode and feed lines depressurize. If the thrust component which appears during the discharge was indeed electrothermal it would take 10-20 seconds to reach steady state as seen in the mass flow switch-off transient however it does not. In addition the theoretical MHD thrust determined by the Maecker formula for a similar geometrical configuration to the T6 cathode matches close to the thrust extrapolations level at zero mass flowrate as shown in Figure 26   Figure 26 T6 thrust characteristics with theoretical MHD thrust at the respective current levels  This data strengthens the hypothesis that the T6LA operates in an MPDT type mode at low flowrates and high currents    


  14 F  Electrostatic acceleration  One other mechanism which coul d also play a role in the thrust generation in both the T5CA and T6LA is electrostatic acceleration of ions through a potential drop due to the formation of a region of positive plasma potential. The existence of this positive column has been seen extensively in experimental measurements and has been proposed as a means of acceleration as ions fall down the potential hill. The structure of the plasma potential is of particular interest because it ma y also be directly associated with the attainable ion energies. High energy ion erosion has been identified as the most probable near-term cause of failure during extended life tests at NASA JPL on the NSTAR ion thruster 51 The plasma density and potential profiles downstream of the keep er electrode in the NSTAR hollow cathode have been extensively measured with scanning probes by Herman and Gallimore 52 Jameson, et al 53 and by Sengupta, et al 54   The source of the energy to pr oduce these ions in excess of 90eV is likely to be RF plasma potential oscillations in the near cathode plume from plasma instabilities 55 Goebel postulated that the source of these plasma potential oscillations is likely turbulent ion acoustic waves generated in the hollow cathode discharge plasma or ionization instabilities termed predator-prey modes in the near-cathode plume region. Evidence indicates that discharge plasma potential oscillations measured by Goebel et al. had amplitudes about twice the average discharge voltage, large enough to account for high ener gy ions accelerated through the potential gap between the oscillation peak and cathode potential 56   Although ions of extreme energies have been attributed to these RF plasma oscillations, the existence of a spatially rising plasma potential cannot be ignored as a source of bulk ion acceleration. It has b een sufficient to regard the spatial or temporal profiles of the plasma potential obtained by the measurements were suffi cient to be considered the mechanism for the generation and direction of high-energy ions well in excess of the discharge voltage. The details of how discharges establishes a spatially rising plasma potential downstream of the keep er or the reasons for the absence of a non-monotonic profile have not yet been fully identified and explained  In the case of a potential hill, an electric field exists across a plasma potential drop  dx dV E 212  M VVe V f e  28 The ion velocity at any point follows from conservation of energy to give the particle velocities shown in Figure 27  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Ion Energy [eV Ion Velocity [km/s Krypton Argon Xenon  Figure 27 Corresponding ion velocities with krypton and xenon for a given energy  Investigations by the author 57 on a \274 inch hollow cathode with an electrostatic energy analyzer operating on xenon and krypton have shown that bulk acceleration of ions is found, particularly with increasing discharge current and decreasing mass flowrate, where peak plasma potentials are likely to increase. An exampl e of this bulk acceleration is shown in Figures 28 and 29 for xenon   Figure 28 Ion energy distributions at 10 amps with xenon  At 10Amps discharge current the ESA data shows slightly energy peaks up to 62.4eV which are likely caused by ion acoustic waves. However the plot also begins to show a bulk acceleration of the 2.44sccm and 2.05sccm conditions 212  27  In this case, the velocity gained by a singly charged particle moving through the potential is   2 1 0 2 


  15 20eV\ereby the complete distribution is shifted up in energy; a process exemplified at higher currents. At 16Amps Figure 26 shows peak ion energies are significantly higher than for the 10Amp condition and with much greater bulk acceleration of plasma; the data for the 2.05sccm flow condition for instance shows little to no ions with energies less than 35eV. The 2.94sccm condition shows a decrease in collected cu rrent contrary to the trend which may be due to some thermal movement, MHD vectoring of the plume or plume expansion   Figure 29 Ion energy distributions at 16 amps with xenon Since no measurements of plasma potential have been made of the T5 or T6 configurations it is not possible to confirm or deny the significance of such a mechanism in our thrust measurements however such a mechanism would only be significant if the plasma was highly ionized and remained in that state through the accelerati on process. If this were the case then plasma potential hill acceleration may play a role in thrust production. Future investigations will aim to identify the role of this mechanism in thrust production by taking plasma potential measurements C ONCLUSION   An overview of the design considerations for hollow cathode thruster optimization has been presented along with data collected from configurations of the T5 and T6 hollow cathode thrusters. The basis for several thrust production mechanisms has been proposed  Analysis of the T5CA results indicate that the thrust mechanism may be explicable by electrothermal type operation in a conventional gas-dynamic mode however with significant plasma pressure contributing to increased thrust as a result of the electron pressure component at the orifice exit. The exact thrust mechanisms of the T6 hollow cathode have been debated for some time. Our results indicate that for high specific im pulse there is considerable evidence that at high currents and low flowrates, the hollow cathode operates as a low power MPD thruster. Due to the relatively low currents, elect ron convective and radiative losses dominate performance and thus give poor thrust efficiencies. If this is the case operation at elevated currents is likely to significantly improve performance and thrust efficiency; although this will be well beyond the rated current capacity for the T6 cathode. Indeed multi-channel hollow cathodes have been proposed and built for MPD thrusters for some time. If the hollow cathode thruster is to have a place in the family of MPD accelerators, it may be as a very low power thruster <2kW \(owing to the low discharge voltages very little power conditioning required. Thrust efficienci es are unlikely to improve significantly since this will scale quadratically with discharge current and will quickly enter much higher power regimes of operation.  Analysis would indicate that while electrothermal acceleration does play a role in T6 thrust production, it does not increase significantly as mass flow is decreased. This suggests that either electron temperature does not increase significantly at lower flow rates or that the energy equipartition between electrons-ions and electronneutrals remains too low for any substantial increase in heat transfer. If the flow in the T6 cathode is also substantially ionized it has also been shown that plasma potential hill acceleration may play a role in thrust production however this requires further investigation  Further detailed analysis is required to verify the existence of each mechanism and to understand the best means in which to utilize them to give greater performance. Further work is also required on anode design in order to optimize performance and increase efficiency. The low voltages obtained in the T6LA and T5CA designs highlight the importance of plasma anode interaction and anode geometry. Previously keeper design has been considered relatively insignificant; however as has been shown optimized keeper design is imperative for hollow cathode thrusters, but also for neutralizers for Hall thrusters, ion engines and plasma contactors for minimization of discharge voltage R EFERENCES   1  Gray, H L, "Development of ion propulsion systems", GEC Rev 12, 3, 154-168, 1997 2 Wallace, N C and Feam, D G, "The design and performance of the T6 ion thruster AIAA Paper 98-3342, 1998 3 Fearn, D, Singfield, A, Wallace, N, Gab-, S and Harris, P The operation of ion thruster hollow cathodes using rare gas propellants AIAA Paper 90-2584, 1990 4 Latham, P M, Martin, A R and Bond, A, "Design, manufacture and performance of the UK-25 engineering model thruster", AIAA Paper 90-2541, 1990 5 Harris, P T and Gair, S, "A revi ew of the cathode construction for the RAE 10/25 mN thruster", IEPC Paper 88-078, 1988 6 Philip, C M and Fearn, D G Recent hollow cathode investigations at the Roya l Aircraft Establishment AIAA paper 73-1137, \(1973 7 Fearn, D G The operation of hollow cathodes under conditions suitable for ion beam neutralization Proc Conf on Electric

presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11

Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
