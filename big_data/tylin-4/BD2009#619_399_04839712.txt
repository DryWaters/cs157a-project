engineers are successful and others aren\222t?   In order to answer that question, NASA recently conducted a study of the behavioral competencies of highly regarded systems engineers working on different types of programs and projects in diverse environmen ts across the agency.  As projects become increasingly complex, NASA understands that it is vital to grow and develop a cadre of highly trained and skilled systems engineers who will be available to ensure the continued success of future missions.  It is not enough to focus only on the science of engineering space systems, since that is only half the story.   The other half of the story is the art of system 
s engineering.  But what does that entail  In April 2008, the NASA Office of the Chief Engineer launched the Systems Engineering Behaviors Study with the goal of studying how highly regarded systems engineers at each of the ten NASA Centers practice the art of systems engineering.  The study was conducted by personnel from each of the NASA Centers and the NASA Academy of Program, Project and Engineering Leadership \(APPEL who were trained in psychol ogy, organizational behavior engineering, human resources, training and development Several study team members were certified to administer and interpret the Myers Briggs Type Indicator \(MBTI\256  The study involved interviewing, shadowing, and observing 
38 highly regarded systems engineers and administering the MBTI to them to identify their personality type.  Once the data was compiled, it was then analyzed for common themes and grouped into clusters of competencies with associated behaviors.  Once the initial analysis was complete, it was reviewed, and concurrence on the overall competencies was sought with the interviewees, once at the center level, and again at the agency level. The behavioral attributes in the findings fall into five broad themes leadership, communication, problem solving and systems thinking, attitudes and attributes, and technical acumen  
This paper 1,2 summarizes the method, findings, and conclusions of the study of behavioral competencies of highly regarded systems engineers at NASA.  It details the competencies and associated behaviors for each of the themes in depth, and summarizes the typical MBTI\256 profiles of the systems engineer s studied.  It also discusses some potential uses of these results to provide a more balanced picture of systems engineering and to train, coach mentor and develop NASA\222s current and future systems engineers  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS

 About NASA The National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA\was created in 1958 as a federal agency to pioneer the future in space explorati on, scientific discovery, and aeronautics research.  NASA consists of NASA Headquarters located in Washington, D.C. and several space flight centers, research cen ters, and other installations located across the country.   NASA Headquarters exercises 1  1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09 25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1198, Version 1 December 18, 2008 Copyright 2008 All rights reserved 


  2 management over the Centers and provides strategic leadership for the agency NASA is organized into ten Centers as follows 1  Ames Research Center \(ARC 2  Dryden Flight Research Center \(DFRC 3  Glenn Research Center \(GRC 4  Goddard Space Flight Center \(GSFC 5  Johnson Space Center \(JSC 6  Jet Propulsion Laboratory \(JPL 7  Kennedy Space Center \(KSC 8  Langley Research Center \(LaRC 9  Marshall Space Flight Center \(MSFC 10  Stennis Space Center \(SSC  Background  The NASA Systems Engineering Excellence Initiative [18  was established in 2002 under the Office of the Chief Engineer \(OCE t o st i m ul at e and enabl e t h e devel opment and advancement of a sound systems engineering capability necessary for success in fulfilling the challenging and ambitious goals of NASA missions.   To support this initiative, NASA created the NASA Systems Engineering Working Group \(SEWG\G generated the NASA Procedural Requirements for Systems Engineering \(NPR 7123.1A i n 2007 for t h e purpose of bui l d i ng a common framework of recognized best practices of systems engineering across the agency The framework consists of three components: technical processes, tools and methods and workforce, knowledge and skills.  In addition, they revised the NASA Systems Engineeri   Then in March 2008, the NASA OCE held an agency-wide Systems Engineering Development Workshop to discuss how NASA leadership could best communicate the balanced picture of Systems Engineering \(SE\to not only working systems engineers, but also to those who must interact with and SE activity.  Three distinct, yet highly integrated, objectives/tasks were identified at the workshop  1  Art and Science of Systems Engineering \226 Define and document the broader scope of systems engineering, focusing on balancing the art and science of engineering space systems 2  SEF Framework Deployment \226 Communicate the entire systems engineeri ng perspective to the NASA technical workforce through various met  3  SE Workforce Development Strategy \226 Establish a comprehensive development strategy to reach all levels of systems engineering participants, with a special focus on identifying and maturing individuals to become the next generation of model space systems engineers The above Art and Science of Systems Engineering activity led to the development of a monograph that, among other things, distinguishes between the art and science of systems engineering as follows  200  The science of systems engineering involves systems management that focuses on rigorously and efficiently managing the development and operation of complex systems.  The emphasis is on managing complexity using organizational skills processes and persistence, as well as infrastructure and tools  The monograph concludes that in order \223to succeed, we must couple technical leadership and systems management into complete systems engineering.  Anything less results in systems not worth having or that fail to function or perform.\224  This study of systems engineering behaviors is a component of the above SE workforce development strategy.  Another component is the Systems Engineering Leadership Development Program \(SELDP i n whi c h t h ese resul t s  are utilized.  The SELDP is predicated on the \223growth mindset\224 identified by 9 i n whi c h one sees oneself as a work in progre ss with opportunities for growth It asserts that with effort systems engineers can grow and change and learn new skills and behaviors [10 1 9  2 0    See Table 1 for a comparison of the fixed mindset vs. the growth mindset 2  M ETHODOLOGY   The NASA Systems Engineering Work Group \(SEWG\in coordination with the Engineering Management Board EMB\s engi neers from their center who they considered the \223go to person\224 in systems engineering The methodology leverages the organizational development expertise and work previously done at JPL for Systems Engineering Advancement Program i n general  and t h e Systems Engineering On-The-Job Training Program, in  7   The study was performed by team members across the agency with backgrounds in one of the following areas Engineering, Psychology, Organizational Behavior, Human Resources, and Training and Development. Several of the team members were certified to administer and interpret the Myers Briggs Type Indicator \(MBTI\256\team interviewed and shadowed 38 highly regarded systems 200  The art of systems engineering is the technical leadership that balances broad technical domain knowledge, engineering instinct, problem solving leadership, communication, creativity and innovative thinking. The emphasis is on leadership and communication skills and ensuring the technical integrity of the system 


  3 engineers and administered th e MBTI\256 to them to identify their personality type.  The interview questions asked are shown in Table 2 Table 1 Fixed Mindset vs Grow  Fixed Mindset Growth Mindset Intelligenc e Intelligence is static Leads to a desire to look smart Intelligence can be developed Leads to a desire to learn and grow Challenges Avoids challenges Embraces challenges Obstacles Gives up easily Persists in the face of setbacks Effort Sees effort as fruitless or worse Sees effort as the path to mastery Criticism Ignores useful negative feedback Learns from criticism Success of Others Feels threatened by the success of others Finds lessons and inspiration in the success of others Results May plateau early and achieve less than their full potential Reaches ever higher levels of achievement View Confirms deterministic view of the world Gives greater sense of free will  After all the interviews, the results were compiled and analyzed for common themes, and the information was grouped into clusters of competencies with associated behaviors.  The interviewees were asked to verify and validate the findings  Table 2 SE Behavior Study Interview Questions Context Questions  1  How would you describe the role of the SE 2  On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is the SE in the success of a program / project Relation to Self and Personal Awareness  3  Create, in behavioral term s, a statement that would describe you as a SE 4  Identify the attitudes and attributes a \223highly regarded\224 SE possesses 5  What leadership behaviors does a \223highly regarded\224 SE possess 6  As a SE, what leadership abilities do you possess 7  On a scale from 1 to 10, how important are these abilities to mission success 8  How are these abilities displayed 9  What general knowledge does a \223highly regarded\224 SE possess 10  On a scale from 1 to 10, how important is this knowledge to mission success 11  What values drive you as a leader 12  How are these values reflected in your attitude 13  Describe what goes on in your mind when you are problem solving Projecting Forward  14  What do you look for in determining if someone will make a good SE 15  How will the job of a SE be different 10 years from now 16  What will the future SE need to know and do differently  3  SE  C OMPETENCY M ODEL   Previous to this study, NASA developed a systems engineering competency model along three axes that includes Technical Knowledge, Process Knowledge, and Personal Behaviors. The Technical Knowledge axis represents systems engineering knowledge in the various product domains used in NASA projects.  The Process Knowledge axis encompasses the 17 SE common technical processes.  The Personal Behaviors axis encompasses five clusters and 40 behaviors.  These behaviors are similar to those found by Davi and M a i e r 10   Thi s  competency model can be used to screen candidates for external hire, to conduct internal assessments of systems engineers, and to drive trai ning content and active career management  Process Knowledge Axis  The process knowledge axis includes the SE common technical processes defined in the SE NPR  and shown in Table 3 below  Technical Knowledge Axis  The Technical Knowledge Axis includes general systems engineering knowledge as well as understanding of engineering in general. \223Highly regarded\224 systems engineers across NASA have a technical grasp of, and appreciation for, system engin eering at all levels. They are usually  generalists in nature, but with proven technical depth in one or two product domains, e.g., Flight System Mission Operations System \(MOS\adar, Avionics Software, etc.  Product domains include avionics, guidance navigation and control, mechanical, power, propulsion telecommuni-cations, thermal, etc.  Good SEs have 


  4 technical knowledge of both flight and ground systems They know when a technical solution is obvious and when a more formal decision process is warranted.  They know how to engage specialists for their technical knowledge and abilities  Table 3 SE Common Technical Processes Process Category Process Subcategory and Common Technical Processes System Design Processes Requirements Definition Processes 1.

Technical Acumen These clusters and the behaviors that comprise them are discussed in more detail in Section 4  4  B EHAVIOR S TUDY F INDINGS   Behavioral Competency Model Framework Three levels of behaviors were identified as described in Table 4.  The data from the study results was grouped into top behavioral themes with mi ddle competencies,  with the lowest level representing the observable behaviors. As mentioned earlier, the behaviors fell into five broad categories leadership, attitudes and attributes communication, problem solving and systems thinking and technical acumen, as shown in Table 5 Table 4 Behavioral Competency Model Framework Level Description Example Top Themes Collections of competencies Attitudes and Attributes Middle Competencies Aggregations of related observable behaviors Seeks Information and Uses the Art of Questioning Lowest Actual Behaviors Observable behaviors Asks difficult questions of discipline or subsystem experts regarding boundaries conditions, and assumptions to ensure continuity across all systems and to ensure the proposed solution is an integrated solution and fundamentally makes sense  The detailed behaviors associ ated with the themes and competencies above are shown in Tables 6 through 10 at the end of this paper MBTI\256 and Temperament Results  The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator \(MBTI\256 was administered to 34 of the 38 highly regarded systems engineers in order to identify their personality or psychological type. Four participants chose not to take the instrument.  The MBTI\256 was selected for two reasons First, it discusses people\222s preferences about how they take in information and make decisions.  Second, it was selected in order to be consistent with a previous study conducted at JPL  


  5 Based on David Keirsey\222s work on Temperament\256, the MBTI\256 results can be broken down into one of four temperaments: Intuitive-Thinking \(NT\Sensing-Judging SJ\sing-Perceiving \(SP\d Intuitive-Feeling \(NF\as shown in Table 11.  The study population had twice as 26%\lowed by SJs \(15%\and one NF \(3%\BTI\256 results for NASA agency-wide SEs in graphic form.  While these findings are interesting, a sample size of 34 is too small to draw any definitive conclusions.  Continued work in this area is being considered Table 5 NASA SE Competency Model \226 Themes and Competencies Top Level Themes Middle Competencies Leadership  Appreciates/Recognizes Others  Builds Team Cohesion  Understands the Human Dynamics of a Team  Creates Vision and Direction  Ensures System Integrity  Possesses Influencing Skills  Sees Situations Objectively  Coaches and Mentors  Delegates  Ensures Resources are Available Attitudes Attributes  Remains Inquisitive and Curious  Seeks Information and Uses the Art of Questioning  Advances Ideas  Gains Respect Credibility, and Trust  Possesses Self-Confidence  Has a Comprehensive View  Possesses a Positive Attitude and Dedication to Mission Success  Is Aware of Personal Limitations  Adapts to Change and Uncertainty  Uses Intuition/ Sensing  Is Able to Deal  with Politics, Financial Issues, and Customer Needs Communication  Listens Effectively and Translates Information  Communicates Effectively Through Personal Interaction  Facilitates an Environment of Open and Honest Communication  Uses Visuals to Communicate Complex Interactions  Communicates Through Story Telling and Analogies  Is Comfortable with Making Decisions Problem Identifies the Real Problem Solving Systems Thinking   Assimilates, Analyzes, and Synthesizes Data  Thinks Systemically  Has the Ability to Find Connections and Patterns Across the System  Sets Priorities  Keeps the Focus on Mission Requirements  Possesses Creativity and Problem Solving Abilities  Validates Facts, Information and Assumptions  Remains Open Minded and Objective  Draws on Past Experiences  Manages Risk Technical Acumen  Possesses Technical Competence and Has Comprehensive Previous Experience  Learns from Successes and Failures  5  S UMMARY AND C ONCLUSIONS   Good systems engineers typically view the system or subsystem as a non-linear web of \223connects\224 or 223disconnects\224 to be solved.  They have a high degree of curiosity mixed with self-confidence and persistence and are achievement-oriented.  They are drawn to the challenge of solving complex problems by possessing an approach that is comprehensive and intentionally does not favor any particular sub-element of a system.  They look across the entire system and facilitate trades and compromises to get a balance, optimized design.  They exhibit excellent human relations skills and understand how to create a vision for the team by keeping the team on track by holding a big picture view of what needs to be accomplished in order to reach mission requirements  They are not afraid to admit what they don\222t know, and are willing to seek experts who do have the knowledge.  They clearly demonstrate the growth mindset in all its many facets.  These findings are consistent with the literature on highly successful and effective people   2  11 12 13   According to John Maxwell in his leadership books The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership  and The 360 Degree Leader  u st posse ss certain leadership qualities in order to be successful.  They must be able to influence others above, below and across the organization build trust, and help others be successful.  They must be willing to admit what they don\222t know and be willing to learn.  They must be willing to both lead and follow Lastly, when they speak, others want to listen and are eager to follow.  It is noteworthy and fortunate that these are the very qualities exhibited by NASA SEs.  Interestingly, most 


  6 NASA SEs do not see themselves as leaders per se, but rather as competent engineers  Most NASA systems engineers stated that good systems engineering does not come from a degree in systems engineering, but from hands-on learning and doing working closely with other successful SEs. They felt strongly that in ten years, the art of systems engineering and the needed SE behaviors would be the same, but that some processes and tools might be different and that certainly the systems themselves would be larger and more complex  While SEs need training in all three axes of the SE competency model \226 process knowledge, technical knowledge, and personal behavior s \226 the personal behaviors component is where the maximum leverage is gained.  That is what separates the merely good SEs from the highly regarded and successful SE s.  The typical NASA SE training program largely ignores the behavior component to the detriment of SEs.  Hence, the results of this study show the need for a major paradigm shift in training SEs NASA recently initiated the Systems Engineering Leadership Development Program \(SELDP\12-month program that provides for technical development in systems engineering in the form of assignments outside the home Center, technical and leadersh ip training, and leadership development, including coaching and mentoring. The SELDP includes many of the hands-on elements needed to truly inculcate the SE behaviors, e.g., developmental assignments, leadership development, mentoring, coaching and job shadowi  While the NASA SELDP is a start in developing the next generation of SEs, it is by no means the end, but rather only a beginning.  The agency would gain value by taking this information and seriously considering inculcating these behaviors into all training for the SE Community  The results of the initial JPL SE Behavioral Study and the Agency-wide study are similar The results of the Agencywide study indicate that while there are many separate Center cultures at NASA, ther e are also shared Systems Engineering behaviors that provide NASA great opportunities on which to build.  Identifying and making these similarities explicit through the use of studies such as this creates a common language and a way to build on the strengths of one of the largest brain trusts in the world.  The similarities in the findings across NASA were unmistakable in proving this point.  Further work in this area could include benchmarking non-governmental agencies to see if SEs in industry exhibit the same behaviors as those at the NASA Centers In conclusion, there are clearly identifiable behaviors that highly successful systems engineers exhibit.  It is not only possible, but highly desirable to openly communicate what those behaviors are, and to encourage members of the systems engineering community to develop them through training, coaching and mentoring.  Knowing how successful systems engineers behave and sharing that information with the SE community establishes a standard for hiring evaluation and personnel development 6  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   Many people have contributed to the success of NASA\222s Systems Engineering Behavior Study 200  Wiley Larson \226 Director, Sp ace Systems Engineering Stevens Institute of Technology 200  SE Interviewees \226   M.
