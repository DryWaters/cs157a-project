Wind power increases the load variation and the reserve requirements for contingencies Utilities are especially concerned about the wind power availability during the peak load demand time. Conventional generation can obtain capacity credit because they can produce firm” power during the peak load demand time. As wind power is intermittent it is normally given zero or small capacity credit In this paper, the wind variation and capacity credit for multiple wind farms distributed in Wyoming are analyzed based on actual wind data. Considering multiple wind farms as part of one big wind farm distributed over a large area can decrease the wind power variation and increase the capacity credits. As the method used here to calculate capacity credit is the same one used by electric utilities, the potential for awarding more capacity credit to multiple wind farms is very good  Index Terms Capacity credit for wind, wind power availability, wind power correlation and variation I.  I NTRODUCTION  HE strength and duration of wind are location dependent The installed power capacity of a single wind farm ranges from a few MW to thousands of MW  Wind power is an intermittent resource which varies continuously. The main concern about wind power is that there is not enough spinning reserve in the system when wind stop blowing, which may result in blackouts in high wind power penetration cases Wind energy can provide a part of the electrical demand but consumers cannot rely completely on wind powered electric energy because it is not available all the time Conventional generators, such as coal-fired and hydro plants have nominal ratings and their operational output can move between minimum and maximum rating freely. However wind turbines are different from them because input wind speed is not controllable as steam or water flow. The output of wind turbines follow the wind sp eed when the wind speed is between the cut-in and nominal speed of the wind turbines Therefore, more reserve capacity is needed when more wind   Y.

There was not a definite conclusion given in  however, i t showed t h at t h e integration costs increases with size as integrating wind power requires more reserve. The co st becomes more with higher penetration The availability of wind power during peak load demand hours is of more concern to the system operators than that of the off-peak hours. The load demand curves were drawn using MISO’s hourly actual load in Fi  It shows t h e dai l y  l o ad curve of Midwest Independent System Operation \(MISO July 18, 2007, which is a typical summer day. The load demand increases during the morning hours and reaches the peak in the afternoon at about 4pm as indicated by “A” in Fig.1. It is worth noting that during morning hours shown as B”, or late night hours shown as “C”, the operating utilities have plenty of surplus generation available to take care of any reduction in wind generation. This is because of the fact that the utilities are prepared, based on their day-ahead or weekahead generation scheduling, to satisfy this day’s peak demand of “A”. During the peak demand time, more generation resources are needed to balance the load demand and the system reserve requirements for contingencies. All the units are pressed into service during these times including very high incremental cost peaking units. Therefore availability of wind power during the peak demand time is much more valuable than at other times. As a result, the utilities award capacity credit for the firm output of generation resources which they can use at peak hours. However, wind power is intermittent and awarded zero or very small capacity credit by the utilities. It is extremely valuable financially for the wind farms to increas e their capacity credit 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 1 4 7 1013161922 Power\(GW Hour  Fig. 1 Hourly load demand of MISO on July 18, 2007  Wind Power Availability and Increased Capacity Credit for Multiple Wind Farms Yi Zhang Student Member, IEEE Sadrul Ula Senior Member, IEEE 002 and  Yibin Zhang T 978-1-4244-6551-4/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE 


 2 Integrating wind power in power systems has impacts on system operation in different time frames. The time frames can be divided into four parts 1  Real time, which ranges from several seconds to a few minutes. Generators react to the system frequency and interchange among different control areas due to continuous load fluctuations cau sed by tens of millions of users freely turning on and off electrical devices. This is responded by Automatic Generation Control \(AGC\with no opportunity for human intervention 2  Short term, which ranges from approximately 10 minutes to several hours. The load changes slowly in this time frame. Economic dispatch operation is following the change of load 3  Midterm, which ranges from several hours to several days. The start-up and shut-down time of generators varies from minutes to hours depending on their types and characteristics. Unit commitment is made to schedule when and which generators start up and shut down ahead of time 4  The long term time frame ranges from several months to several years. New load and generation are planned in this time frame as well as outage and maintenance schedules Although wind turbines have been producing electrical power, it is not generally considered for providing firm capacity in the system and only get credit for energy produced. For both large electrical power produces and users kWh or energy cost is only about half or even less of the total electrical cost. The capacity or demand cost is most of the remaining cost which wind power produces miss out from benefiting most of the time. This paper focus on wind power’s impacts in time frame 2, i.e., short term, the most important time frame for maintaining system stability and hour-by-hour operation of the power system. This paper discusses the wind power availability and variation between individual wind farm’s location and their combination. Finally, the capacity credit is calculated separately for each location and their combination and the increase in the extremely valuable capacity credit awarded to four isolated wind farms compared to their combined effect is quantified. The difference of capacity credit rewarded between individual wind farms and multiple wind farm combinations are also presented II.  W IND D ATA A CQUISITION  One of the major challenges of wind power availability analysis is the lack of reliable wind data. Over the last four years, the University of Wy oming Electric Motor Training Testing Center has installed more than 30 wind measurement towers in the state of Wyoming and Nebraska. They covered a very large area of eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska The locations used for this study are shown in Fig. 2. The shortest and longest distances between two locations are 100 km between A and C and 300 km between B and D. The data were collected from April 1 st 2006 to March 31 st 2009. The data include the wind speeds at 60 meters, 50 meters, and 40 meters, the wind directions at 60 meters and 50 meters, and the temperatures at ground level. The quality of wind data captured by the data loggers used in this paper is over 98 good. The data were averaged and recorded by the data loggers every 10 minutes. The time of data loggers at different locations were set via cell phones and watches. The time error of each location is estimated to be 1 or 2 minutes. The mean wind speed and the potential MW capacity of each location is shown in Table I  Fig. 2 Wind measurement locations in Wyoming and Nebraska  TABLE  I W IND D ATA AND P OTENTIAL C APACITY  Site A B C D Summer Average Wind Speed \(m/s 6.53 6.73 7.80 6.32 Winter Average Wind Speed \(m/s 6.95 9.17 9.87 8.07 Summer Standard Deviation 3.68 3.36 4.07 3.50 Winter Standard Deviation 3.73 4.55 4.49 4.08 Capacity \(MW\ 30 30 30 30 III.  W IND P OWER A VAILABILITY  For this study, let us assume no scheduled outage or maintenance in the wind farms. The generation only depends on the local wind speed, i.e the wind turbines will produce electricity if wind speed is between the wind turbines’ cut-in and cut-out speeds. The output of wind turbines will follow their power curves. The wind turb ines used in this paper are GE 1.5XLE and its power curve is shown in  It s cut i n  rated and cut-out speeds are 3.5 m/s, 14 m/s and 25 m/s  10-minute-average wind speeds for four days of summer and winter are plotted from raw data and shown in Fig. 3 From the 10-minute-average wi nd speeds of all locations, it can be found that the wind speeds of the four locations are seldom below the cut-in speed \(about 3.5 m/s to 4 m/s\and above the cut-out speed \(25 m/s\ the same time. In other words, these locations are able to partly compensate each other’s no wind condition due to geographcal dispersion Diurnal wind speed can describe wind speed variations in one day. The diurnal wind speeds of the four locations and the diurnal load demand of MISO are shown in Fig. 4. The wind speeds of locations A and D have similar trends as MISO load demands in both summer and winter. The wind speed of location B does not change much in a day. The wind speed of location C is fairly flat in winter and opposite to the trends of MISO load in summer. The peaks and valleys of the wind 


 3 speeds of the four locations occur at different instances of time  a\mmer   b\ter Fig. 3 10-minute-average wind speed for four days  The output power of the wind turbines cannot be estimated using average speed s because the power curves of wind turbines are not lin ear with speeds. Wind speed distributions, which are shown in Fig. 5, are needed to estimate output power The percentage of time wind power is unavailable \(wind speed lower than 4 m/s or higher than 25 m/s\s from 19.4% to 29.3% in summer and from 10.6% to 23.2% in winter for an individual location. Transmission system operators have to increase the reserve requirements to backup the wind power when a new wind farm is connected to the grid. Bigger wind farms need higher reserves. But if multiple wind farms are considered, the wind unavailable time decreases dramatically. The percentage of wind unavailable time is 3.6% in summer and 1.7% in winter when the four locations are considered together as one big wind farm distributed over a large geographical area

If the time series x and y depart, then r x,y is near -1. If the two time series follow the same trend then r x,y is near 1. If the time series are not correlated, then r x,y  is near 0 The cross-correlations shown in Table II are calculated based on 10 minute wind speeds. All the numbers are positive which means any of two time seri es are correlated. The crosscorrelations are related to the geographical distribution of the locations. Locations C and D are more correlated than other pairs because they are most clos e in all the locations. Location B and D are least correlated because they fall apart farthest  TABLE  II a  W IND SPEEDS CROSS CORRELATION AMONG THE LOCATIONS IN SUMMER  Site A B C D A NA 0.39450 0.49236 0.58699 B NA 0.37968 0.37197 C  NA 0.63084 D - - - NA  b  W IND SPEEDS CROSS CORRELATION AMONG THE LOCATIONS IN W INTER  Site A B C D A NA 0.36339 0.46232 0.55105 B NA 0.38604 0.25448 C  NA 0.62869 D - - - NA

One is that unpredictable wind power can increase the load variations and forecasti ng errors dramatically. This is true for large individual wind farms with high capacity, but if the capacity is distributed throughout many locations, the variation is not as big as an individual one. Fig. 8 shows hourly average wind power at the four locations and their combined effect. The capacity of each location is scaled from 30 MW to 120 MW — the total capacity of the four locations then the standard deviation of each location with scaled capacity can be compared with that of the combination The output power of the combin ation is the average of the four locations, but its standard deviation is minimum. All the four locations are not completely correlated, so they can cancel parts of the variations of each other, therefore, its variation is overestimated as far as the impacts on the system is concerned. Currently the impacts of wind farms on the power system are studied as individual farms V.

So the wind penetration in WY is 11%. The average load in WY is about 2,000 MW, which is not far from the assumption in Table IV.

The load carrying capability, i.e. capacity credit, is shown in Table VII The capacity credit awarded to the combination of the four locations is highest and it is over twice of the lowest location B. Even the capacity credit of the best location A is lower than that of the combination. Both the system operator and wind farm owners can benefit from the combination of the four locations: the system operator can decrease the reserve margin because combination of multiple wind farms can increase the firm output; the owners of wind farms can share the capacity credit and lower the integration cost, which is proportional to the required reserve  TABLE  V A VAILABILITY   C APACITY F ACTOR  AND S TANDARD D EVIATION OF W IND P OWER DURING 4:00 PM TO 6:00 PM IN J ULY   A B C D Combination Wind power Availability 89.52% 76.08% 86.56% 83.60 100.00 Capacity Factor 35.87% 19.81% 33.33% 30.28 29.82 Standard Deviation 116.05 85.33 122.11 115.28 79.47  TABLE  VI A VAILABILITY   C APACITY F ACTOR  AND S TANDARD D EVIATION OF W IND P OWER DURING 4:00 PM TO 6:00 PM IN A UGUST   A B C D Combination Wind power Availability 94.35% 85.75% 90.59% 87.63 96.77 Capacity Factor 33.68% 25.49% 33.81% 28.35 30.33 Standard Deviation 110.52 105.37 112.49 97.20 79.86  TABLE  VII W IND C APACITY C REDIT OF F OUR L OCATIONS AND T HEIR C OMBINATION  A B C D Combination July 87.7 MW 39.4 MW 73.6 MW 64.2 MW 92.8 MW August 88.8 MW 56.1 MW 84.0 MW 69.6 MW 91.0 MW  The above calculation is based on the wind data measured at locations around 300 km apart. Their correlations become lower when they are distributed farther according to Table II If the wind farms in Wyoming and Texas 1,200 km apart are considered as one big wind power resource, a higher proportion of wind power could be considered a firm resource to produce electricity VI.  C ONCLUSION  Wind availability of a single wind farm is low, but if a number of wind farms distributed over a large distributed area are combined and looked at as a whole generation resource then the availability of wind power increases dramatically Real wind data from four locations in Wyoming is used in this paper. Compared with each loca tion, the combination of the four locations can increase the wind availability and decrease the wind power variation. The capacity credit is higher when 


 7 the wind power from the four locations is combined. As the method to calculate capacity credit used here is also used by electric utilities, the potential for awarding more capacity credit to multiple wind farms is very good VII.  R EFERENCES    B.

FURTHER ANALYSIS We now consider issues of consumer segments switching inertia, and customer profitability gradients to further enrich our understanding of hyperdifferentiation s impact on consumer choice and firm profitability Consumer Segment Models So far, we have used data from all our respondents to estimate our MNL models for two product experiments. Next, we use three segmentation criteria based on journey characteristics, and develop consumer segment models. These criteria are travel frequency, origin-destinations city-pairs, and the traveler s current main mode of transport. Consistent with the public transport service provider s practices, we categorize travel frequency into three levels: low, medium, and high-frequency. These are the same criteria we used for the two product experiments that we discussed so far. High-frequency travelers travel more than three times a week. Medium-frequency travelers travel less than three times each week but more than three times a year. Low-frequency travelers travel even less. The second segmentation criterion is origin-destination citypairs We consider three major origin-destinations  Amsterdam/Schiphol-Rotterdam \(AS-R\, Amsterdam Schiphol-Breda \(AS-B\otterdam-Breda \(R-B which are served by High-Speed Trains operating in the catchment area. The third segmentation criterion is the current travel mode being car or train. Figure 1 shows the relative effects for the segment model attributes. Due to space limits, we only show results for the general pricing experiment; subscription pricing gives similar results Figure 1. Main Effects of Attributes in Segments   Each horizontal bar is scaled to 100%, to compare relative weights of attributes across different segments The main effects of the attributes are quite different across segments, as the results suggest. We see that the relative weight for price varies considerably across segments. For example, medium-frequency travelers who currently use the train and travel between Amsterdam and Breda \(AS-B-Train-Medium\ are the most pricesensitive consumers. \(They have a relatively higher utility for price.\milarly, the users who travel by train between Rotterdam and Breda with low frequency \(R-BTrain-Low\ are most likely to purchase the service if a higher refund option is available. \(They have a relatively higher utility for the after-sales refund option.\We noted there are different levels of consumer preferences within each segment. This allows service providers to target strategically appropriate consumers, provide the most suitable product, and achieve higher profitability. So service providers will be better off serving higherfrequency travelers with a travel product valid the entire day. Why? These consumers place higher value on this product attribute compared to other attributes. These results are of interest to service providers who want to enter and compete in a hyperdifferentiated public transport market. To wit Although the firm can now make whatev w a n t s to m a k e it i s  m o s t ben e f i cial to produ ce exactly what the customer wants to buy 5, p. 8   Switching Inertia Switching inertia occurs for a number of reasons: reluctance to change, habits or preferences for the status quo satisfaction with current product offerings, the lack of real or credible alternatives, and consumer loyalty. To explore consumers reluctance to change, we compared the Travel Mode for the MNL segment models and show the results in Figure 2    Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


  Figure 2. Customer Switching Inertia  The inertia increases when consumers travel with low frequency, by car, and travel between Amsterdam and Breda \(A/S-R\e also see that females have higher inertia than males. The results also show that consumers in all segments need to be offered recognizable value to persuade them to consider a new alternative. The combination of the after-sales refund option, time window for the validity of the ticket, and seat reservation could overcome the segment s switching barriers. Service providers need to reach an inertia breaking point to make a business case and encourage consumers not to return to their baseline Travel Mode They also need to reveal their consumer needs-based segmentation map to move forward in developing hyperdifferentiation strategies Customer Profitability Gradient Our transport market exhibits a strong customer profitability gradient  This refers to the presence of extreme differences in profitability between the best and the worst customers in a market 8, p Serv ice prov iders can tak e adv a n tage of the customer profitability gradient identified for each of the micro-segments, along the dimensions of travel frequency, origin-destination city-pairs, and current travel mode that we discussed The differences in profitability exist because there is a difference in firms cost to serve customers In pu blic transport, providing services at peak hours \(7-9am and 4-6pm\pared to off-peak hours, is very expensive. If a great difference exists among customers in preferences for departure time, firms can identify the customer profitability gradien t and focus on serving the most profitable customers during the peak hours and offload the unprofitable ones to the off-peak hours. We analyzed customer departure time preferences and plotted them by different travel purposes in Figure 3 The results show that 51% of commuters and 41% of business travelers depart from home between 7-9am whereas 34% of business travelers and 50% of leisure travelers travel right after the peak between 9-11am. The demonstrated large customer differences in travel time provide firms with the opportunity to be profitable by reducing costs through lowering peak-load traffic while generating additional revenue  Figure 3. Departure Time Pattern by Travel Purpose   7. CONCLUSION Drawing on the theory of consumer informedness we empirically tested trading down and trading out behavior in a public transport market Consumer informedness  plays a critical role in determining consumers  willingness-to-pay With the availability of smart cards and mobile technologies, service providers will be informed of consumers individual demand preferences and, thus, can better leverage the effective use of hyperdifferentiation and resonance marketing. A customer profitability gradient allows the High-Speed Train provider to introduce efficient pricing and revenue management strategy Based on choice theory and using a stated choice experiment 10 our study provides an empirical assessment of how service providers: \(1\ explore the relevant product attribute space; \(2\ign their product offerings to capture the most profitable responses; and \(3\plement an information-based strategy to profit from the available customer profitability gradient. For managers seeking feedback on how customers view their offerings choice modeling provides a method of turning customerdriven feedback into profitable and sustainable strategies for retaining and capturing market share 25, p. 10 Consumers have different perceptions of value, so the existence of this customer profitability gradient allows firms to design new product offerings along value dimensions that are in their design range. Resonance marketing requires understanding of the demand side, so that the firm knows what each customer segment wants to buy, and how much it is willing to pay. Traditional strategies for products targeted to the mass market can be augmented through the recognition that increasingly informed consumers engage in trading down and trading out behavior. From this base, they can work toward better accommodating consumer behavior in their revenue management decision-making. Thus, firms can create a new connection between their revenue management and   10  Compared to the stated choice method, the revealed preference method deals with observed choices and works with real and objective values. Thus, it has higher external validity. A combination of both data can result in better estimation results  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


  resonance marketing strategies. With consumer informedness, strategies involving resonance marketing can deemphasize prices in consumer shopping decisions and help firms to gain sustainable competitive advantage This supports the predicted move from a reliance on mass-market fat spots to a strategy based on profiting from high-margin sweet spots 5 There are limitations. First, using a mixed logit model would permit us to account for heterogeneous tastes of consumers. Second, payment ownership who actually pays for the travel product has an influence on willingness-to-pay too. Additional analysis of this issue will likely provide greater power for interpreting trading down and trading out behavior in the transport market REFERENCES 1  Air Canada.

cyclic processes are essential for structured data collection [e.g. 13, 19]. We agree that the cyclic process, as well as structured data collection, is essential. However, we would argue that the borders of the cyclical processes are emergent and changing. This means that determining when one phase \(such as problem diagnosis such as planning intervention for negotiation. If the action research project truly takes the continuously changing practice into account it makes it impossible to initially plan the whole project, including all the cycles and phases \(see Figure 1 Instead, we would propose that one of the areas essential to creating the engagement necessary for the knowledge translation context is to manage the cyclic perspective on the research. This includes continuously evaluating the practical problems as well as identifying the theoretical research approach. We believe that allowing the theoretical approach to change and move together with the context increases the chances of producing theoretically anchored findings immediately relevant for practice. However, managing this process requires that the data collection techniques are continuously re-evaluated. Without clear borders between activities, the risk of getting lost in the practical problems increases. Therefore, we argue that it is essential work of action researchers to distinguish themselves from the practical cycles, stepping back and reflecting upon the practical problems in light of the research cycles. In this process, the action researcher needs to continuously construct and reconstruct the borders of the project. While constructing and reconstructing borders, we found it beneficial to view the dual cycles of action research practice and research  other 8.3. Managing the network The action researcher?s role depends on the changing context, and effort is required to sustain the relationship with practice both at the organizational Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 and collaborative level. Here the networker role is essential, however often missing from the literature on action research. The problematic issue of putting in extra work to keep the access to the field has been mentioned in previous research [4]. Through our experience, we argue that putting in the time for networking is not a choice but a condition for action research. The extra time is not necessarily well used producing products to meet short term practical goals e.g., such as producing technical reports requiring quick turnaround best used building up engagement and networking as well as keeping the door open and noticing new opportunities. The small, quick products are sometimes important \(such as the phone interview report in our case that producing these short term products requires too much time to justify their usefulness when viewed only as in relation to the research cycle. In some situations producing objects \(e.g., reports demonstrable use as research products might have demonstrable long term consequences as networking and trust-building tools, thus contributing to the knowledge translation process, linking theory and practice 8.4 Translating theoretical concepts The process of co-authoring with practitioners across disciplinary lines involved translation of theoretical concepts to the practitioners. And although 


theoretical concepts to the practitioners. And although it was clear that they were interested in writing, the hospital staff had very little time, if any, available during their normal work hours. Therefore, the time for research was constrained, and writing was mostly done outside regular working hours. In this situation it is not possible to overload your co-authors with a lot of reading material. Instead, you need, as a part of the coauthorship, to present the theoretical perspective as well as the theoretical argument in the actual writing You describe much more about the theoretical framework than you do normally. However, these more detailed descriptions of the theoretical framework do not end up in the final submitted papers. In this way there is a lot of extra effort required when writing with practitioners. There is much more articulation work 28, 29] involved in the cooperative work of coauthoring papers with practitioners Moreover, since the context is changing, the theoretical foundation for research also needs to be reconstructed. This means that when allowing the practical situation to guide the direction of research, it calls for a malleable theoretical perspective. Therefore we would argue that stability in theory is an idealized vision [13], and an important part of action research as knowledge translation is to balance the theoretical approach with the actual practical work We would argue that even though it is challenging to co-author with practitioners, this process adds to the data collection and interpretation techniques, since you get the practitioners? perspective on the actual theoretical findings, which helps ensure that the theoretical contributions are relevant for practical situations. Finally, we believe that co-authoring can be seen as a knowledge translation activity supporting the design of information systems that is unique to action research 9. Conclusion We set out to investigate IS action research as a knowledge translation process that enables the development of new theoretical knowledge together with practitioners and ensures findings have practical relevance for the design of health information systems We found that establishing a research context as a knowledge translation context required a strong relationship with practice. This strong relationship supported our engagement with the actual design activity of the health information system, spurring a process of crucial negotiations for the reconfiguring of the generic EDIS Creating the research context as a context of knowledge translation requires four important activities: 1 goals, 2 managing the network, and 4 the continuously changing theoretical conceptual framework By identifying these activities embedded in action research, we, at the same time, question some of the taken-for-granted descriptions of action research as they appear in the information system community [8 Negotiating and renegotiating the dual goals raises questions about whether or not it makes sense at all to have, as an ideal approach, the researcher/client agreement negotiated initially [10, 13], because it will change over time Naming managing the action cycles as a crucial part of action research causes us to question the whole approach presented in many descriptions of action research?that the research project is a straightforward clearly phased process [9, 13, 19 Pointing to the essential element of managing the 


Pointing to the essential element of managing the network as a part of action research makes visible an absent issue of action research, which has not been addressed within literature. We found that network was essential for creating the close relationship with practice, establishing a context for knowledge Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 translation where the creation of knowledge directly impacted the design of health information systems Finally, we argue that creating and translating the continuously changing theoretical conceptual framework is an important part of action research when viewing it as a knowledge translation process. Here we challenge the notion that action research is based upon a clearly defined theoretical foundation upfront [6, 13 14] by stating that the theoretical approach is a moving target following the forever-changing context  Action research contributes to the design of health information systems by engaging us, as health IT researchers, in the processes of designing and computerizing hospitals. We become committed to producing timely and accessible findings that can be used in practice. By noticing issues of the design, we make possible conflicts visible and available for negotiations in the actual process of design and reconfiguration. When we then engage in discussions and negotiations with the practitioners, volunteering theoretical conceptualizations of the experienced issues, we, together with the practitioners, co-construct the context of research and knowledge translation Knowledge translation does not go only one way, since both researchers and practitioners construct and create new meaning essential for new knowledge Action research in HCI knowledge translation comprises the dual process of transforming and aligning practitioners? practical experiences into empirical observations, as well as developing transforming, and aligning theoretical concepts relevant to explain, interpret, and understand the empirical observations We do not claim to have produced a conclusive list of the work required to establish action research as a knowledge translation context. Instead, this is the beginning of articulating an important benefit of action research in a user-centered design perspective, which has been neglected in previous HCI papers [1]. We support the work of B  dker and Buur  [3] in that enacting research on user-centered design together with practitioners engaged in real life practices and contexts, such as in hospitals, will benefit from applying action research approaches. We do hope others also will take up the challenge to engage in action research projects by participating in design processes, since this will bring new venues for HCI research in general Acknowledgement This study is a part of the research project ACTION for Health, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Grant #5122003-1017, titled ?The role of technology in the production, consumption and use of health information: Implications for policy and practice,? with contributions from Simon Fraser University Vancouver General Hospital, and British Columbia Children?s Hospital References 1] C.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
