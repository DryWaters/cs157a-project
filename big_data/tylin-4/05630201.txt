Keywords Soft starter, ANFIS, IGBT and dc motor  I   I NTRODUCTION  The direct-current\(dc\machine is not as widely used today as it was in the past. Nevertheless, in some place dc motors still been used because the speed-torque relationship of dc motor can be varied to almost any useful form, and its continuous operation is commonly available over a speed range of 8:1.Dc motor also can be applied where it momentarily deliver three or more times its rated torque 000\021\000\003 The starting current of dc motor is very big if it is direct started. So 
only small dc motor can be direct started. For medium and high power dc motors, it is necessary to control the starting current. The soft starter based on the technology of PWM is more appropriate than other means If soft starters are substituted in such applications reduction of inrush current can be achieved and on the other hand, energy saving can also be possible. Energy savings by voltage control through soft starter is achieved by reducing the core loss and copper loss 2 s o f t s t art e r f e d dc m o t o r system, smooth acceleration with reduced stress on the mechanical drive system is achieved. This is due to high 
starting torque hence increase the life and reliability of belts gear boxes, chain drives, motor bearings and shafts Soft starters allow the machine to start, vary its speed and stop with minimum mechanical electric stresses on the equipment. This can be done by appropriate adjustment of the dc motor terminal voltage. However, adjusting the voltage for a given operating condition of speed and torque is not a simple task. To adjust the voltage, the pulse width of the IGBT shall be calculated for each operating condition. Some methods of closed loop control technique to achieve this have been 
developed and presented in t h i s  m e t h od, s p eed s e n s or i s  required to acquire the signal feedback. Some researchers have proposed and developed a method of optimal soft starting without a speed sensor in which sensing of IGBT voltages is very much requ   This paper proposes a new adaptive neuro fuzzy based soft starting strategy for modulating of the pulse width for IGBT in voltage controlled dc motor drive system. The proposed strategy is mainly operates in open loop and speed and voltage sensors are not required. In this paper simulation procedures 
and results have been presented for the proposed method and they have been compared with the conventional soft starter results II  P RINCIPLE OF S OFT S TARTER  A soft starter is a dc voltage controller in which the voltage is adjusted through modulating the pulse width which control the IGBT to be on or off. Fig. 1 shows the typical schematic of a dc voltage controller or soft starter. The starting IGBT sequentially switches on and off the armature coil and the 
starting coil. This causes to change the voltage between the two Fig. 1 Schematic of a soft starter of dc motor sides of the armature coil and the starting coil, respectively to the change of the rotor currents and machine speed. Switching of IGBT are provided by micro-controller. Micro-controller allows to realize PWM regulation of IGBT. In addition the micro-controller realizes a feedback function with current sensor. Comparison of currents, measured with desirable

The operating IGBT is worked III  ANFIS  M ODEL  The adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system \(ANFIS\s a fuzzy system and used in classification, modeling and control problems [9  I t i s b a s e d o n T a ka gi a nd Suge no s fuz z y  i f-t he n rules representation[7   w h i c h i s  d i ffe re nt from commonly used fuzzy logic controllers  T he A N FI S  neuro-fuzzy system [8  11 us e s t h e t r ai ni ng d a t a set t o  build the fuzzy system in which, membership functions are adjusted using the back propagation algorithm, allowing that the system learns with the data that it is modeling. A networktype structure similar to that of a neural network, which maps inputs through input membership functions and associated parameters, and then through output membership functions and associated parameters to outputs, can be used to interpret the input/output map is shown in the fig. 2 The adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system \(ANFIS\ has total four layers. Nodes in layer one are input nodes representing input linguistic variables Nodes in layer two are membership nodes. Here, the Gaussian function is used as the membership function\(MF\. Each membership node is responsible for mapping an input linguistic variable into a possibility distribution for that variable. The rule nodes reside in layer three. The last layer contains the out put variable nodes. More details about ANFIS convergent theorems and the learning algorithm can be found in[6            Fig. 2 Structure of ANFIS dc soft starter IV  S YSTEM M ODELING  Fig. 3 shows the proposed system and which is modeled mathematically using software package MATLAB/SIMULINK. The motor parameters are as given in tabel 1 It is important to note that the system has a good modeling if the training set is enough representative, i.e., it has a good data distribution to make possible to interpolate all necessary values to the system’s operation. After set the number of clusters that are estimated to compose the data, the cluster’s centers are searched in an iterative way based on minimizing an objective function. This represents the distance between a data value to the cluster’s center. In this paper, the technique of subtractive clustering has been used to estimate the number of clusters Table1.

Its operation can be resumed in two steps 1\ The set of membership functions has to be chosen their number and corresponding shape 2\The input-output training data is used by the ANFIS. It starts making a clustering study of the data to obtain a concise and significant representation of the system's behavior The ANFIS model and the drive system have been implemented with MATLAB / SIMULINK package. ANFIS considers two inputs such as armature current and the previous pulse width of the motor and one output namely pulse width of the IGBT. Iterative training of the neuro fuzzy system has been done to achieve the desired output. The presence of this iteration comes from the capability of the training program to simulate the system and, after a pre-defined simulation time to obtain the simulation results and use them to the training

The initialization for ANFIS training was done by grid partition[9 Th e tr ain i n g d a t a o b tain ed  f r o m  o f f  lin e s i m u latio n  of the motor with different armature current and pulse width and the corresponding steady state speed was recorded for each set. The training was done for 150 epochs, after which the sum of squared error was reached to 0.006, which is within acceptable limit. The final membership functions after the training is shown in Fig. 4. It can be noted that the membership functions crowded near the rated value. This may be due to overlapping and bunching of the curves in this region. More rules are required to classify large training data  Fig.4\(a\Final membership of current functions after training  Fig.4\(b\Final membership of previous pulse width current functions after training 001\016 R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSIONS   Simulation results of the proposed system are shown from Fig.5 and Fig6  Fig.5\(a\e starting speed curve with PID control   Fig.5\(b\e starting current curve with PID control   Fig.6\(a\e starting speed curve with ANFIS control  Fig.6\(b\ the starting current curve with ANFIS control  Fig.5 shows the starting current and the speed of dc motor with conventiolal PIDcontrol. Fig.6 shows the starting current and the the speed with ANFIS control. Comparing the current curve and the pulse width of the ANFIS control and the PID control, the ANFIS control can reach the stable speed within shorter time, and has obvious advantage than the conventional PID control system with shorter adjusting time and less over adjustment volume  003   C ONCLUSION  In this paper, a new method of controlling soft starter fed dc motor drive system using ANFIS has been introduced This method has a back propagation based neuro-fuzzy structure with four layers and clusters. This model was simulated using set of data obtained by simulations. The generated data are amature current and previous pulse width patterns as inputs an their corresponding pulse width patterns as output of the ANFIS model. The results obtained by this ANFIS model shown in this paper are more accurate and this approach has solved the problem of the complexity of the online determination of the pulse width of IGBT for any operating condition R EFERENCES   1  F.

We consider the following access control constraints  exclusive/inclusive ordered pairs EOP Payment   Insurance  IOP BookHotel   BookFlight   disallowed delegation sequences  w 1 o 3  w 6 o 5  w 7 o 6   w 1 o 4  w 6 o 5  w 7 o 6   Obviously, the adjusted FSMs of both w 4 and w 5 contain no Book Hotel so as to preserve IOP, and w 6 has to be excluded due to its violation of EOP We called our approach Adjusted AR because it selects the performer of each task based on the aggregated reliabilities of the adjusted composition Adjusted AR is compared to two other approaches namely random and AR The random selection method randomly chooses a qualified performer for each task without checking access control constraints The AR selection method makes the performer selection based on the aggregated reliabilities of the original \(un-adjusted\mposition. For the two approaches, access control constraints are consulted only at the end of each execution to determine the success or failure of an execution instance To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we chose the success rate as the primary performance metric, which measures the ratio of the execution sequences whose tasks are all successfully delegated to and executed by component WSs without violating any access control constraint. For both AR and random methods, at the end of each execution, the specified access control constraints have to be verified. Thus, we also report for the two approaches the denial rate for EOP and IOP and the denial rate for disallowed delegation sequences. The former indicates the ratio of all execution sequences denied by the specified EOP/IOP constraints, while the later measures the ratio of all execution sequences violating some disallowed delegation sequences Our experiments ran on a PC with a Intel CoreDuo L2400 CPU\(1.66 GHz\d 1GB RAM running Windows XP professional. We randomly generated 10,000 execution sequences of the target workflow and assumed a fixed reliability probability for each operation or activity \(called delegation reliability\. Figure 15 shows the success rates of each algorithm under various delegation reliabilities. It can be seen that the success rates of Random and Adjust AR gradually increase with the delegation reliability and Adjusted AR has the highest success rates.  AR strategy has the lowest success rates when the delegation reliabilities are greater than 0.7, because the delegation that leads to the largest aggregated reliability tends to violate some access controls resulting in failed execution. This is justified by the observation shown in Figure 16 that AR has much higher EOP + IOP denial rates when the delegation reliabilities are greater than 0.7. Figure 17 shows that Adjusted AR has the lowest denial rates induced from the violation of disallowed delegation sequences   Figure 15.

Conclusion  This paper investigates the problem of performer selection for each task in a workflow in presence of access control constraints. We proposed to use exclusive/inclusive ordered pairs and disallowed delegation sequences to model many types of access control constraints in the literature. The exclusive/inclusive ordered pairs are used to adjust the FSMs of component WSs and participants before composition. The disallowed delegation sequences are checked at runtime to enable the selection of a better performer for each task in the workflow The proposed approach is evaluated using synthetic data and is shown to result in the execution that is less likely to violate any specified access control constraints  The current approach involves the evaluation of the disallowed delegation sequences at runtime which could be time consuming. We are currently investigating more efficient methods for handling the disallowed delegation sequences. In addition, more experiments are needed to shed the light on the efficiency and other measures of the proposed approach in a more systematic way. Finally Incorporating access control with QoS measures other than reliability will be explored in the future  7. References    E. Bertin o, E. F e rrari, an d V.

the following characteristics to maximize user experience in mobile advertising: 1 and suitable user interface maximizes user experience 2 communication between mobile marketer and consumer, 3 telecommunications platforms and also location based technologies. For mobile advertising to succeed business models that can capture the synergy of two existing industries, advertising and telecommunications, must be conceived. In any future sustainable business model, all players will have to reach a consensus on the structure of the system and on the importance of each player in that system [9]. The factors affecting the mobile advertising media are: 1 Players; key players and their roles, 2 relationship and cross media working in mobile advertising value chain, 3 regulation which place sets of rules for the collection and procession of location-based data  This paper delineates the results of an empirical study conducted to evaluate the strength of set of hypotheses around selected conceptual model. A five point Likert-Scale survey of a convenience sample of 115 Mobile marketing experts was conducted to help evaluate the hypotheses and statistical hypothesis testing techniques have been employed at 95 confidence level to evaluate the results. The paper also documents some valuable suggestions received from the mobile marketing expert community  The results of the survey have proven the conceptual model in the respective areas of Consumer Privacy, Purpose &amp; Performance Content Credibility and Customization Price Process &amp; Policy believe that this proposed Conceptual Model/Framework can serve as a solid base for the evaluation of the critical success factors for a marketworthy mobile advertising strategy  The main objective of this article was to explore mobile advertising?s challenges and future directions by evaluating factors that seem to influence mobile advertising. The theoretical contribution of this article lies in outlining the key factors of mobile advertising Author hopes that this article opens new dialogues on multiple unexamined issues concerning mobile advertising industry. The paper has addressed an important and topical subject, as there has not been sufficient empirical evidence to date to substantiate any of the theoretical models that have been proposed regarding the factors that influence the success of mobile advertising. This paper its conclusions will be a valuable contribution to the debates in academia  A potential extension of our research is to field this same set of survey  questions, \(which was fielded to mobile advertising experts for the sake of this paper be fielded to mobile phone consumers across different demographics in different countries to assess how the consumers? perceptions stack-rank against the experts opinions. The authors hopes that this article opens new dialogues on multiple unexamined issues concerning mobile advertising industry  6. References   1] Balasubramanian S., Peterson R. A. and Jarvenpaa, S.

acquisition of transport information by selecting OWLQoS documents which describe quality of Web services from a repository that contains 3 OWL-QoS documents discovered previously. Similar to the example in Figure 2, the Filter Schema FS1 is used to read and select appropriate OWL-QoS documents, and the Filter Schema FS2 to create new OWL-QoS documents for the place ?OWL-QoS document?. As Filter Schema provides no means for formulating inequality operators like ?&gt;? and ?&lt;=?, which are usually used to express constraints with parameters whose quantitative values are limited to a certain interval, transition inscriptions Figure 4. XML net for Web service discovery Figure 5. Filter Schemas for Web service discovery definitions 1 service name: \\s*flight\\s*/i c definitions service name: \\s*train\\s*/i b a definitions 1 1 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 can be used in combination with Filter Schemas to formulate QoS constrains Suppose that the traveler wants to use only the Web services that cost no more than 100 US Cent. The Filter Schema FS1 should then be created as shown in Figure 7. The variable of the attribute filter ?rdf: resource? of the element filter ?owl: onProperty? is instantiated with a regular expression to filter OWL-QoS documents specifying the property ?costUSCent?. To ensure that the maximal cost of the Web service doesn?t exceed 100 US cent, the inscription of the transition ?select transport info service? should be formulated as owl:maxCardinality &lt;= 100?. In process simulation or execution, the inscription is parsed and integrated into XQuery statements using XPath inequality operators  6. Conclusions  In this paper we presented a WSC method based on XML nets, which inherit advantages of Petri nets such as formal semantics and graphical expression. XML nets have additional strengths in the description of process and data objects, and the exchange of XMLbased structured data. The advantage of using XML nets for WSC is that control flow modeling, data and data flow modeling, and WS discovery and selection can be realized using a uniform powerful modeling language. Some uncomplicated tasks, as illustrated before, can be fulfilled without developing or using additional software components or agents. Naturally XML nets can also be combined with other Web service techniques to fulfill more complicated and demanding tasks  7.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
