1 Token Based Congestion Control for DTNs Eric Coe Cauligi Raghavendra Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering University of Southern California Los Angeles CA 90089 ecoe@usc.edu raghu@usc.edu Abstract\227 Delay tolerant networks DTN are characterized by intermittent connectivity long delays and often constrained bandwidth We consider mobile networks where node mobility and covert operation cause frequent disconnections Nodes will see each other frequently but due to their movement end-to-end paths do not remain stable long enough to complete a data transfer or even a simple data exchange much less allow current congestion control protocols to react to these highly dynamic environments To address the challenge of congestion control in DTNs we have imple 
mented a novel congestion control mechanism based on the use of tokens Network nodes must possess a token in order to inject messages into the network Tokens are initially uniformly distributed but thereafter move randomly throughout the network Using a discrete event simulator we show Token Based Congestion Control TBCC results in a reduction in the amount of dropped messages due to network congestion In cases where drops are not allowed we add a constraint to the forwarding algorithm and show that network transit times are reduced by as much as 40 and total transit times de\002ned as the time from message generation until delivery to the destination are reduced by 20 We also show 36 reduction in the amount of intermediate network storage required These results are signi\002cant since they show a reduction in

works arise from frequent node movements and mobile nodes operating in a stealth or covert mode With scheduled and ondemand unmanned aerial vehicular UAV support to supply communication services along with periodic satellite communication opportunities there is an obvious parallel between current disruption tolerant networking scenarios and tactical military networks Since these networks are truly challenged networks they can bene\002t from DTN technology making them more robust The overarching goal of the DTN architecture and protocols is to provide delivery of data messages or bundles between nodes in challenging environments where traditional network protocols such as TCP/IP and MANET protocols breakdown Such environments violate many underlying assumptions of TCP/IP networks including the existence of an end 
to-end path between all nodes short delays on communication links and stable or always-on link connectivity The DTN research community has been creating RFCs to address areas of architecture bundling security and have been developing various reference implementations for interoperability testing Much research effort has been put into substantially improving the areas of security and routing However one can note that the convergence layer for DTNs still depends heavily on TCP Congestion control mechanisms included in TCP can not adjust to the challenging environment presented by DTNs As such determining an appropriate congestion control mechanism for DTN is considered a key issue The following section discusses history of congestion control in different networking environments and speci\002cally identi\002es previous congestion control schemes for DTNs Next 
Token Based Congestion Control is described and the general algorithm is provided We then describe the simulation environment including mobility and traf\002c models used present results from our simulation study and conclude with a summary of 002ndings and directions for future work in the area 2 B ACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK Congestion control has been a major concern for networking technologies ever since congestion collapse w as observ ed in the early Internet The solution developed back then which still provides protection against congestion collapses today is that sources reduce their sending rate into a network they 


determine to be So wh y is congestion seen as such a problem Congested nodes have no way to deal with congestion except to drop packets If packets continue to arrive at the bottleneck node faster than the node can forward them large amounts of packets can be dropped These packets may have been forwarded through many previous hops and consumed considerable network resources before 002nally being dropped The dropped packets will also cause data to be retransmitted which can further reduce network performance While there exists vast amounts of research on congestion control mechanisms for wire-line netw   or more appropriately TCP operating over wire-line and for wireless networks   and only a handful t hat address DTNs These congestion control solutions can be classi\002ed as either performing congestion avoidance\(proactive responding to congestion events\(reactive or the hybrid class which tries avoidance but then reserves the ability to react by dropping messages Traditional networks rely on their inherent end-toend paths to relay congestion information back to the source from either an intermediate node or the destination Whether explicit ICMP squelch or implicit missing TCP segment acknowledgments methods are used both travel on uninterrupted paths back to the sender and have some notion of bounded time to transit the reverse path DTNs on the otherhand do not have the luxury of using stable contiguous paths to inform senders of network congestion and hence can not rely on timely feedback mechanisms Seligman Fall and Mundur approach congestion a v oidance by moving previously stored messages to neighboring nodes The algorithms they used to perform their Storage Routing are made up of message selection node selection and retrieval selection The retrieval process mirrors their push process except that it is initiated by the receiver instead of the sender In layman's terms a neighbor must have a lower queue occupancy than the of\003oading node and must agree to maintain custody of the message Burleigh et al created a congestion control scheme based on an economical pricing model which uses a rule-based mechanism The mechanism uses local information e.g current buffer occupancy messages timeto-live value and messages priority to help individual nodes determine if they should accept a message from a neighbor node Framing the problem this way results in nodes being incentivized to move the largest possible volume of data per unit time Assuming that most DTNs operate over a wireless medium of some form it is unclear if this is the best incentive recalling as sensor network researchers like to point out 224Every packet sent or received brings the node one step closer to death\224 Our work differs from those mentioned above in that our solution aims to match traf\002c input to the network capacity In this sense our algorithm can be classi\002ed as a congestion avoidance technique 3 T OKEN B ASED C ONGESTION C ONTROL TBCC The underlying idea behind token based congestion control originates from the desire to match the amount of traf\002c entering a network to the total network capacity 3  If the network as a whole or any individual node is only presented with an amount of traf\002c that it can forward then situations like congestion collapse can be a v oided Our tok en mechanism is similar to Token Ring Token Bus or FDDI in that nodes must possess a token to transmit data but differs in that TBCC only needs a token to inject data into the network and not for performing per hop forwarding of messages In this way the network as a whole is considered the limited resource tokens allow access to as opposed to the ring or wire for the three previously mentioned protocols TBCC views the network as a blackbox The cost for a node to inject a single data message into the blackbox is a single token and tokens are reclaimed when messages exit the network Messages can exit the network in one of the following ways 017 Messages reach their destination 017 Messages are dropped due to insuf\002cient buffer space at a node 017 Messages are discarded due to Time-To-Live timer expiration Nodes that execute one of the above methods for message termination increase their token count thus reclaiming that message's token We assume nodes will not disappear from the network and therefore claim the number of total tokens in the network remains constant over time Our token mechanism works as follows initially tokens are evenly distributed among all network nodes When applications generate data to be distributed it is stored in an application queue We simulated an in\002nite application queue for the purpose of removing effects of connectedness in evaluating the congestion mechanism 4 Since the algorithm is speci\002c to DTNs it is assumed all network nodes are cooperative in the forwarding of messages and the sharing of available/extra tokens The token mechanism is independent of the routing algorithm used and is only triggered if a suitable next hop neighbor is discovered Details on the routing algorithm used to evaluate TBCC are presented in Section 4 under Environment Setup and Discussion  Below is the Token Based Congestion Control algorithm used to determine how messages enter the network and actions nodes take once messages leave 1 Source node encounters new Source queries routing protocol to determine if one of the new is the best ne xt hop for a message held in 3 Total network capacity being de\002ned as the amount of data a network can deliver to destinations in a bounded time 4 Dropping messages from source queues because no suitable neighbors exist misses an underlying principle of DTNs namely that paths or in this case neighbors are not always available 


3 the application queue if best next hop 6  NULL AND my tokencount 025 1 then decrement tokencount and transmit message to best next hop else if tokencount  1 then Query neighbors for extra token if Extra token is available then decrement neighbor tokencount and transmit message to best next hop end if end if 2 Source node generates new message Source queries routing protocol to determine if any current neighbor is the best next hop for the new message if best next hop 6  NULL AND my tokencount 025 1 then decrement tokencount and transmit message to best next hop else if tokencount  1 then Query neighbors for extra token if Extra token is available then decrement neighbor tokencount and transmit message to best next hop end if end if 3 Message dropped in the network Upon receiving message node checks if queuestate  FULL then drop message AND increment tokencount end if 4 Message TTL timer expires Upon routing beacon update receipt foreach message in the queue check if T T L T imer  currrent time then drop message AND increment tokencount end if 5 Message reaches destination Upon receiving message node checks if messageDestination  this then pass message to application layer AND increment tokencount end if 4 S IMULATION E NVIRONMENT We evaluated TBCC using our previously developed discrete event simulator written in Java This simulator has been used to evaluate various DTN multicast broadcast routing and congestion control schemes The importance of using correct mobility models for MANET research has been pointed out by W ith that result in mind care w as tak en to ensure the networks and traf\002c used to drive simulation where appropriate for evaluating congestion control techniques operating over DTNs The following two subsections describe how these networks of interest were constructed along with the traf\002c pro\002le used to drive the simulation Networks of Interest Our research to date has focused on networks that exhibit disconnections due to frequent or fast mobility The token based congestion control algorithm targets networks where nodes see each other frequently but due to quick mobility end-toend paths cannot be maintained Networks were created with the defacto random waypoint mobility model and connectivity was controlled by adjusting node densities and node speed After analyzing these networks we needed another variable to adjust which would provide 002ne grained control over network connectivity characteristics The greatest connected component GCC metric provides the 002ne grained control for network generation Using GCC we created a mobility model that provides more control over the connectedness of networks This is important in conducting research for disruption tolerant networks that are MANET-like but not MANET MANET-like meaning nodes see each other frequently but their movement causes MANET protocols to fail as opposed to DTNs where delays between contacts are large The model begins by initially positioning nodes on a grid such that given their radio range only a certain percentage of the network would be members of the greatest connected component Given a network of 100 nodes and a desired GCC of 65 nodes are placed such that for a given range approximately 65 nodes are in the GCC From there each node follows the algorithm below if Current GCC  Desired GCC 5 then Nodes inside the GCC move outside with probability p  Current-GCC Desired-GCC  Current-GCC Nodes outside the GCC stay outside we are already over our desired GCC end if if Current GCC  Desired GCC 5 then Nodes inside the GCC stay inside we need them to stay put Nodes outside the GCC move toward the GCC center with probability p  1 this increases the stability of the GCC and avoids oscillations end if Figure 1  GCC of 70 and 50 of 70 nodes 5 We added a range of 2 to help bound the average GCC recorded 


Figure 1 shows the GCC plotted versus simulated time for both 50 and 70 GCC We point out that while a certain percentage of nodes are in the GCC their movement ensures that no end-to-end paths can be established thus con\002rming the algorithm generates DTN networks Traf\002c Models There are two different traf\002c models used to evaluate TBCC protocol The 002rst models a sensor network where nodes periodically send data among themselves 10 of the network sends updates every 50 simulated time tics while the remaining nodes send updates every 100 simulated time tics Depending on the capacity of individual nodes and their initial token count this model results in minor congestion within the network as can be seen from Table 1 QS-10 QS-20 QS-40 50 4925 473 2 60 2881 108 0 70 0 0 0 80 0 0 0 Table 1  Mixed Traf\002c Model Message Drops The second model is built on top of the 002rst and exhibits more of a traditional sensing network where an observed stimulus results in generation of high traf\002c loads In this model a node is randomly selected to send 1000 messages among all nodes at a designated time This blasted traf\002c happens twice during the simulated time Since both designated times are random the second could occur before the network has time to recover from the 002rst blast Environment Setup and Discussion The networks used were produced from the GCC mobility model outlined above which consisted of 60 nodes operating in a 100x100m grid with a range of 5m Nodes move between grid points with a speed of 5m/s The routing utility function is based on time last seen Nodes update their utility table with the LASTSEEN timestamps for a neighboring node 6 The utility function then compares neighboring nodes utility values for the destination with this node's value The node who has seen the destination most recently is determine to be the next best hop Initially all nodes LASTSEEN timestamps are set to 1 indicating that they have never seen the destination node Data reported in the results section is the average of 10 different runs over the same network The speci\002c traf\002c generation times source and destinations pairs are randomized among the runs We ensure that no messages transit an end-to-end path by verifying that the hop counts plus any time waiting to access the wireless medium does not equal the network transit time We note that some message do traverse a single hop from source to destination which is acceptable 6 We make an assumption that the link layer or a lower layer informs the network layer of links coming up and going down As discussed above our mobility model is based on random movement and we generate enough traf\002c to cause congestion within the network Our Token Based Congestion Control protocol cannot guarantee zero message drops within these types of networks For networks where zero message drops would be required we add an additional constraint to the underlying forwarding scheme and term this adjusted forwarding scheme backpressure  When using the backpressure forwarding scheme nodes cannot forward messages to neighbors if the neighbor queue is full We add an additional boolean 003ag isQueueFull to be reported in response to routing utility update beacons Nodes reporting back a full queue with their utility metric LASTSEEN timestamps cannot qualify as a best next hop neighbor Even though these nodes can not be a next hop neighbor they still need to report their utility metric in response to update beacons to ensure accurate tracking of the utility function Since this new scheme results in zero message drops we evaluate TBCC over other metrics of interest such as total network transit time average queue occupancy and average hop count 5 R ESULTS In evaluating how well Token Based Congestion Control TBCC handles network congestion within DTNs we 002rst looked at how connectivity can affect congestion on a network Figure 2 shows that as the greatest connected component increases network connectivity from 50 to 80 moving from left to right on the 002gure the amount of dropped messages decreases regardless of the queue size One might infer from looking at Figure 2 that the effects of increased connectivity results in fewer dropped messages for a given queue size While that is true from a pure numbers point of of view Table 2 shows that once messages drops are normalized to the 50 GCC case the case where queue size equals 40 actually drops a larger percentage of traf\002c as connectivity increases This should come as no surprise we are merely Figure 2  Using No Congestion Control seeing the law of diminishing returns here The effects of 


5 increased connectivity reduces congestion more in networks that experienced more congestion to begin with When connectivity increases there are more opportunities for data to enter the network Once data has entered the network there exists more possible hop-by-hop routes to forward toward the destination These new opportunities in essence help to alleviate congestion points throughout the network The take away from this table and graph is that as networks become more disconnected congestion control becomes more important and hence motivates us to study congestion control for DTNs Next we'll see how TBCC can help mitigate those congestion points QS-10 QS-20 QS-40 50 100 100 100 60 71 62 74 70 39 35 49 80 15 23 32 Table 2  Drops Normalized to 50 GCC Setting the initial token counts or for that matter total number of network tokens for nodes is the only con\002guration parameters available for TBCC One should remember TBCCs goal is to match traf\002c load entering the network to total network capacity Applying an initial token count equal to the queue size across all simulation runs we see how well our simple Token Based Congestion Control scheme performs in alleviating congestion experienced by networks previously congested Figure 3 compares the number of dropped messages with TBCC using initial number of tokens equal to the queue size verses using no congestion control mechanism The number of dropped messages is greatly reduced for a queue size of 10 across all the GCC percent connected values resulting in an average of 69 reduction in dropped messages For queue sizes of 20 and 40 the results were more pronounced with 97 and 100 reduction in the number of dropped messages In other words for queue size of 40 setting the initial token count to 40 resulted in dropping zero messages compared to the approximately 600 messages dropped using no congestion control scheme The 600 dropped messages represents 2 of the total messages sent This is a signi\002cant result for DTNs which lacking end-to-end acknowledgment schemes have considerable trouble dealing with any data loss For DTN networks where data loss is determine to be unrecoverable we present results of the backpressure forwarding scheme Recall that nodes using the backpressure scheme must report full queue status to neighboring nodes Nodes that report full queues are not eligible to be best next hops neighbors This constraint ensures that no messages are dropped Figures 4 and 5 represent the various trades offs that are made when using backpressure to achieve a dropless network The far left of Figure 4 shows the average time is takes messages to transit the network using no congestion control This 002gure contains data for both networks of 70 and 80 GCC connectedness From this 002gure we can see that as we increase the number of tokens in the network the network transit time increases More tokens results in more messages in transit which causes the queues to become more occupied as seen in Figure 5 Longer queues means a longer duration of contention for the shared wireless medium which leads to increased latency As seen an important aspect of TBCC is having the correct number of tokens in the network Too few results in an under utilization while too many results in message drops and longer queues Figure 3  Token Based vs No Congestion Control Figure 4  Network Transit Times 6 C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking research has greatly increased over the last 6 years with areas such as routing broadcast/multicast and small experimental implementations receiving the majority of researchers attention In this paper we examined the area of congestion control by using a simple 


Figure 5  Network Transit Times token scheme which allows nodes to inject messages into the network only if they hold a token Our results show that by selecting an initial token count each node has to approximately the queue size of the nodes a reduced number of messages are discarded and a reduction in network transit times when compared to no congestion mechanisms In future work we will examine a dynamic creation and deletion of tokens based on localized congestion detection Our simple token scheme is inherently tied to the network capacity and while there exists many results for multi-hop wireless networks in estimating network capacity the ability of the network to move data over time there has been little work to-date for determining DTNs capacity R EFERENCES  S Burleigh K F all V  Cerf R Durst K Scott H Weiss L Torgerson and A Hooke 223Delay-tolernat networking An approach to interplanetary internet,\224 IEEE Communications Magazine  June 2003  J P artan J K urose and B Le vine 223 A surv e y of practical issues in underwater networks.\224 in ACM International Workshop on UnderWater Networks WUWNet  September 2006  http://www dtnr g.or g   J Nagle 1984 January Online A v ailable http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc896.txt  V  Jacobson 223Congestion a v oidance and control 224 in SIGCOMM 88 Symposium proceedings on Communications architectures and protocols  New York NY USA ACM 1988 pp 314\226329  L Xu K Harfoush and I Rhee 223Binary increase congestion control bic for fast long-distance networks,\224 in IEEE Infocom  IEEE 2004  D X W ei C Jin S H Lo w  and S He gde 223F ast tcp motivation architecture algorithms performance,\224 IEEE/ACM Trans Netw  vol 14 no 6 pp 1246\2261259 2006  D Katabi M Handle y  and C Rohrs 223Congestion control for high bandwidth-delay product networks,\224 in SIGCOMM 02 Proceedings of the 2002 conference on Applications technologies architectures and protocols for computer communications  New York NY USA ACM 2002 pp 89\226102  K Chandran S Raghunathan S V enkatesan and R Prakash 223A feedback based scheme for improving tcp performance in ad-hoc wireless networks,\224 in ICDCS 98 Proceedings of the The 18th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems  Washington DC USA IEEE Computer Society May 1998 pp 472\226479  H Lim K Xu and M Gerla 223Tcp performance o v er multipath routing in mobile ad hoc networks,\224 in Communications 2003 ICC 03 IEEE International Conference on  vol 2 2003  X Y u 223Impro ving tcp performance o v er mobile ad hoc networks by exploiting cross-layer information awareness,\224 in MobiCom 04 Proceedings of the 10th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking  New York NY USA ACM 2004 pp 231\226 244  M Seligman K F all and P  Mundur  223 Alternati v e custodians for congestion control in delay tolerant networks,\224 in CHANTS 06 Proceedings of the 2006 SIGCOMM workshop on Challenged networks  New York NY USA ACM 2006 pp 229\226236  A Goundan E Coe and C S Ragha v endra 223Ef 002cient broadcasting in delay tolerant networks,\224 in Global Telecommunications Conference 2008 IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 IEEE  30 2008-Dec 4 2008 pp 1\2265  F  Bai N Sadagopan and A Helmy  223The important framework for analyzing the impact of mobility on performance of routing protocols for adhoc networks,\224 Ad Hoc Networks  vol 1 no 4 pp 383 226 403 2003 B IOGRAPHY  Eric Coe received his B.S degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering from the University of Missouri Columbia in 1997 and a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering specializing in Computer Networks from the University of Southern California USC in December 2000 Mr Coe is currently pursuing a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from USC His research interests have included distributed computation in Active Networks along with routing broadcasting and multicasting in Disruption Tolerant Networking Most recently Mr Coe has been studying architectural changes that would al

 6 Increased Ease of Deployment &amp; Astronaut Safety Technology enhancements provide the option of using modular platforms. Each instrument would be outfitted with its own miniaturized central unit containing power, telecom to a base station subsystems. A base station would provide for overall control and communication with the Earth. The units would be modular in that each miniaturized subsystem module would be designed to accommodate the needs of any of the instruments in the ALGEP package \(Figure 2 and short connection would be required to provide power and data interfaces between the subsystems module and the instrument. This concept deviates from the hub and spoke concept \(Figure 1 would not be dependent on the length of the power or command and data handling lines that must connect each of the instruments to the central station as it was with ALSEP The instruments could be deployed long distances from each other and would be essentially wireless. Additionally it would not be necessary for astronauts to handle nuclear materials. This concept has the potential to decrease deployment complexity and risk and increases astronaut safety 4. ALGEP INSTRUMENT SUITE The instrument suite used to design ALGEP range from instruments in the early concept stages to those being developed for specific missions. Therefore, the instrument specifications presented in Table 2 represent the characteristics of the instruments as they are known today and would likely continue to be refined in the future 5. DESIGN ASSUMPTIONS AND DRIVERS Design Assumptions The design of the ALGEP package is based on a number of design assumptions that played a critical role in the outcome of the package design and capabilities. The following are the design assumptions  Figure 2  Conceptual design of a remote unit with instrument for ALGEP.  The hub is the same  except instruments are not attached and the S-band patch antenna is arranged on the end of one solar  array  7  Package operational lifetime is 6  2 years  Instruments would operate continuously if necessary over the lifetime of the package with the exception of the seismic sounder which would operate for two weeks during the daylight  Package will tolerate the lunar surface temperature range of -170  C to 125  C  Package will operate on solar arrays and battery in any location on the Moon \(essentially equatorial to polar regions with the worst-case assumed to be ~16 days, to be conservative, at equatorial locations  Package baseline design assumes no nuclear power  For ease of deployment and astronaut safety the package will be designed to be as wireless as possible  Direct-to-Earth communication will be through the Deep Space Network \(DSN  Science data latency is not a driver to allow for alternative operational scenarios that do not require continuous communication with ground stations as was needed for ALSEP  Each instrument will be required to buffer collected data for at least a one hour period Design Drivers There were three key design drivers that needed to be 


There were three key design drivers that needed to be considered when developing ALGEP Nighttime Operations  Operations during the lunar night is by far the strongest driver. The package must be able to collect data from its instruments during the lunar night which may be up to approximately two weeks long in the equatorial regions. The seismometer and magnetometer require continuous data collection during the lunar night although the seismometer can operated in a scientifically valuable lower data volume mode to reduce the memory size necessary in the command and data handling subsystem. The lunar nighttime temperature environment also drives the power and thermal subsystem design Seismology as Data Volume Driver  The passive seismometer is the data volume driver during nighttime operations. It accumulates ~240 Mb \(compressed hour period during the lunar day and ~2.4 Gb \(compressed of data during a 16 Earth day lunar night. The seismic sounder acquires ~0.7 Gb per measurement resulting in nearly 700 Mb of data per day on average.  It would be operational only during the lunar day as it is another data volume driving instrument. The ALGEP science team has determined that all the necessary science could be acquired in two weeks of lunar light lending itself to power each of the 6-12 necessary sensors with very small batteries keeping  Table 2.

This driver played a role in package configuration and deployment methods Astronaut safety drove the design to a solar powered package and the conscious effort to make the package as wireless as possible. Additionally, in an effort to make the package as relatively easy to deploy as possible the design was driven to modular units 6. ALGEP ARCHITECTURE Modular Design Through consideration of the requirements and key design drivers a modular system was developed for ALGEP. Two types of modules were developed: the hub and the instrument remote units. The hub would be responsible for collection of all data from the instruments and direct-toEarth communication of the data.  The instrument remote unit would be independent of the hub and would provide power and data interfaces to each instrument \(i.e., each instrument requires a remote unit with the exception being the retroreflector remote units would be needed for each package. The remote units do not require any physical links with the hub as was the case for ALSEP. The remote units could be placed any distance from the hub as long as it is within line-of-sight of the hub and does not exceed 100 m which is currently a telecom subsystem design limitation \(Figure 3 unit was designed with worst-case instrument in mind for each subsystem so they are intended to be identical \(see  Figure 3  Example deployment scenario for the ALGEP remote units and hub on the lunar  surface. Each remote unit has an instrument connected to it through a data and power interface and could be deployed  up to ~100 m from the hub as long as line-of-sight is maintained.  The remote units and hub have their own  solar arrays and battery to generate and store power for night time operations.  The laser retroreflector is a  passive instrument and does not require power or data interfaces 9 Figure 4  Top, assembly procedure for a remote unit or hub.  Modular units were designed for  ease of assembly Bottom left, ALGEP Avionics Hub Assembly containing power, C&amp;DH, and telecom subsystems Section 7 Subsystem Descriptions for details the remote units to be fully interchangeable with any of the instruments currently part of the package. This configuration permits ease of deployment for the astronaut as they could select any instrument and connect the power and data interfaces to any remote unit. Additionally flexibility has been built into the design in that astronauts assuming that they are able to return to the location, could 


simply replace instruments and remote units if they fail or are in need of repair The hub has similar subsystems as the remote units \(Figure 4 accommodate the additional S-band radio to allow for communication with Earth and the additional data storage capacity to store all the instruments  collected data during the day and long duration night \(see Section 7 Subsystem Descriptions for details Solar and Battery Powered System The nuclear-free requirement for the package design calls for a solar powered system with a low-power operational mode for the long lunar nights that are approximately two weeks in equatorial regions. This low-powered mode must accommodate survival of the system as well as data collection and storage for instruments through the use of an appropriately sized battery.  To keep the power usage low during the night, communication from the remote units to the hub would only be during the daylight Assembly of Package With regard to astronaut safety and ease of deployment, the assembly procedure was kept as simple as possible. The package was constrained as much as possible to the smallest volume possible in order to keep the package manageable by a couple of astronauts and potentially be able to transport the package in one of the astronaut controlled vehicles being developed in the Constellation Program. The deployment takes six steps \(Figure 4 1 2 3 10 4 not shown in figure, not required for the hub 5 6 see power subsystem section and Figure 5 for discussion An additional step of ensuring that the S-band antenna is pointed at Earth would be required for the hub 7. SUBSYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS Power Subsystem Design Requirements  The ability to design a non-nuclear powered package drives the electrical power subsystem EPS Surviving the lunar environment, including the long cold night, is an extreme challenge for the EPS. A synergistic design with the thermal and command and data handling subsystems is required to achieve this challenging goal. The requirement to operate throughout the night necessitates a passive thermal design able to operate at ambient -170  C with an absolute minimum of electrical heater power, and a very low-power solution to nighttime data collection and storage. The same thermal design must protect the battery from destructive temperatures in the daytime ambient 125  C environment. A six year lifetime could only be met with a maximum battery daytime temperature not to exceed 35  C Operating at any latitude from the equator to the poles is another demanding challenge that effects the configuration of the solar array, and drives the mechanical design of the solar panels  Design Assumptions  The power subsystem would be able to use the same solar array, battery and power electronics design for both the hub and the remote instrument units The hub does not operate instruments, and therefore, worstcase power load on the remote instrument unit \(specifically the seismometer battery needed  Lack of a data latency requirement allows ALGEP to forego nighttime communications and preserves battery power for 


nighttime communications and preserves battery power for critical tasks. The direct-to-Earth communications downlink would only be operated at the hub near noon, when plentiful solar array power would be available, minimizing battery depth-of-discharge \(DOD communication pass lengths, which interacts favorably with selection of ground station dish size and operations costs  The sizing of the battery is the first step in the design process. Obtaining a suitably low nighttime average power would be required to keep battery size reasonable. As a rule of thumb, each Watt of nighttime load power required requires 1000 W-hr of battery capacity. A constraint was set to not support more than ~3 W of nighttime average load power over the worst-case 16 Earth days of darkness to keep the battery size manageable for stowing volume and deployment ease purposes. This allows for all combinations of latitude and season. This goal was exceeded through various innovations. The worst-case load \(seismometer plus controller instrument remote unit 16 days including 30% contingency. An additional 183 mW would be dissipated by instrument controller power conditioning unit \(PCU nighttime, for a battery sizing requirement of 2.38 W average  The solar array design is intended to be adjusted by the astronaut, as no single design without adjustment could meet the requirements imposed by an all-latitude design The ALGEP array design would be able to operate with panels oriented vertically for polar operations, horizontally for polar operations, or partially deployed \(e.g. 45  from Figure 5  ALGEP solar arrays can be deployed with varying angles to accommodate different  lunar latitudes 11 horizontal Figure 5 flexibility allows for the design process to precede landing site selection  Description of the Design  The battery delivers 934 W-hr based on the 2.38W continuous for 16 Earth days, \(384 hours was also made to be compliant with the battery cycling limitations in JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles. This increased the requirement to 1557 W-hr of energy storage. At 28.6 V, an eight-cell lithium ion battery would have to be sized to 54.5 A-hr capacity. This matches very well the Lithion NCP55-2 cell design at 55 A-hr that is available off-the-shelf  The solar array as was inspired by an umbrella structure While it was originally envisioned as having triangular shaped panel sections, a diurnal array energy analysis showed that the active array area required was small. The assumptions for the analysis are shown in Table 3  Among the three cases considered \(polar, equatorial, and mid-latitude latitude. The solar array was assumed to be deployed to 45   from horizontal to best capture the mid-latitude solar energy. Each of the four panels simulated was independently tracked over a single day to integrate to total panel energy. The results of the study are shown in Table 4  The result of the analysis is that a small 0.2 m2 solar array could provide over twice the required power, including all battery recharge inefficiency related losses. This shows a design margin of over 100% against the 30 W daytime power requirement for the hub, excluding any dust losses The dust losses in the lunar environment are poorly known 


The dust losses in the lunar environment are poorly known but ALSEP retroreflector performance suggests 100 margin would be ample  The small array area required allowed the mechanical design of the array to be simplified. The result would be a very narrow-width solar array configuration shown in Figure 5  The power electronics for the hub and remote units would be identical. The single design would be able to support either a remote unit with instrument and UHF radio or the hub with S-Band DTE and UHF links. A block diagram of the avionics is shown in Figure 6  Design Rationale  The power subsystem would be single string, direct energy transfer, unregulated 28V power bus similar to a conventional low-power spacecraft. It has been optimized for low mass and volume, including the ability to have convenient stowage form factors. The solar array would be the single element with a challenging form factor The long, thin stowed configuration allows it to be packed inside a protective tube. This design also works well for the thermal design, as it would provide minimal blockage of the thermal radiator space view factor \(see thermal subsystem for details of the thermal design  Risk  The design was envisioned using parts and design processes that would be available in the 2010 timeframe and thus does not contain any advanced technologies. The risks inherent in the design could largely be mitigated via a thorough test program. Demonstrating low-power performance, acceptable thermal performance, and solar array durability and electrical performance would be logical verification and validation activities  Thermal Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP elements must be maintained at specified temperature limits for operation on the lunar surface while in an environment that has temperature variations between -173 to ~127  C, and a solar incident energy variation from 0 to 1367.5 W/m2  Design Assumptions  Mission life is 6 Earth years \(except the Seismic Sounders, which operates only from landing to the end of the first lunar day able to operate continuously during the lunar night Table 3.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual

Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
