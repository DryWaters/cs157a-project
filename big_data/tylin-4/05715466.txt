The idea, analysis, and system formation of network teacher evaluation system in Chienkuo Technology University Ming-Ching  Ho Department of Electronic Engineering Chienkuo Technology Unversity Changhua 500, Taiwan, R. O. C hmj@ctu.edu.tw Chun-Hua Chen Department of Computer and Communication Chienkuo Technology Unversity Changhua 500, Taiwan, R. O. C godsons@ctu.edu.tw  Abstract In order for Chienkuo Technology University 002 CTU to improve the quality of  teaching, research, counseling and services, we localize three efforts 002 the effort of studying 
strength, and willingness\and pursue vitality, quality excellence and outstanding performances. There are 8 medium indexes and 33 detailed indexes in teaching performance, 7 medium indexes and 54 detailed indexes in research with industrial cooperation, 9 medium indexes and 76 detailed indexes in service with counseling, 6 medium indexes and 25 detailed indexes in teacherês professional growth, totally 189 detailed indexes The network teacher evaluation system not only brings a big impact to our teachers, but also gives them the goal to work in the future.  Teachers usually check the evaluation items first and then find the items that are easy for them to achieve.  The 
school has put this teacher evaluation system in its academic policy.  Therefore, teachers all need to face this system with a positive attitude and work hard to succeed  Key word: Teacherês evaluation, The effort of studying strength, willingness, Research with industrial cooperation Service with counseling, Teacherês professional growth I  I NTRODUCTION  Because of the drop down of birth rate, in order to protect excellent teachersê work right, Taiwan MOE added college teacher evaluation in academic college policy.  Therefore, for school to pursue teaching excellence and improve teaching quality, the practice of teacher evaluation is a must do 
In order to uplift full time teachersê performance of teaching, research, service and counseling to improve overall teaching quality and teacherês professional image to receive social acknowledgement and respect, the teachers in our school not only need to teach in a excellent way, they are also required to do research, counseling, and services to localize three efforts\(the effort of studying, strength, and willingness\ and pursue vitality, quality, excellence and outstanding performances, moreover, to setup an important referential index of promotion, continuing contract, lay off discontinuing contract , reward and counseling for improvement of full time teachers, we established çCTU 
teacher evaluation methodsé according to academic college policy of item 21 Our teacher evaluation items include: teaching performance, research with industrial cooperation, service with counseling, teacherês professional growth.  We hope that by the practice of teaching evaluation we can help the teachers to improve themselves in all academic aspects and studentsê learning The main tasks of teacher is teaching, lecturing, and answering questions.  There are also the main items in teacher evaluationé topics A  Motivation and Research Goal In our schoolês teacher evaluation method, we established a lot of items to cover all teachersê all efforts for 
the school and student.   It is a very complicated and diversified system.  Such a diversified and complex evaluation system not only need school faculties to collect and verify the substantial evidence of certain items evaluated teacher also need to upload their own evidence data.  After summing all the tasks from all related ones, we will calculate each sectionês scores and give the result to higher management level for follow-up consequential counseling and later on policy making The goal of teacher evaluation: 1. to provide a proper system and portfolio for evaluator and the one being evaluated for improving teaching method and teaching innovation. 2. by using systemi 
zed portfolio to assist new teacher or teacher with teaching difficulties 3. Provide a standard for teacherês promotion, adjustment, and dismissal 4. Provide a fair base of classification and continuous studying of teachers.  5. Provide a knowledge base of teacherês on job education, seminar.  6. to provide a motivation for teacher to revise class planning, improving and career planning, on job training, reappointment and promotion in academic fields[1-2   B  The Aspects of Teacher Evaluation Foreign scholars like Dr. Rifkin believed the universities teacher evaluation should include classroom teaching student counseling, teaching services \(paper instruction 
publications, performance, public services and research[1  Dr. Peng figured out in a university teacher evaluation mechanism research of MOE the six main domains of university teacher evaluation : 1. academic contributions, 2 creative showcase, 3. teaching and counseling, 4. school services, 5. industrial cooperation, 6. teacherês profession moral, characters and team cooperation[2-3  C  The Importance of Constructing Teacher Evaluation Indexes  Teacher evaluation should include Qualitative and Quantitative.  The qualitative evaluation index means the

way the evaluators use words to describe the attainment of each index is very detailed but there is still the space of improvement for objectivity.  The quantitative evaluation index is to use numeric method to present the performance of evaluated teachers in a scientific and convenient way but not humanly and its objectivity is also a question for further study.  Therefore, a system with equal importance of Qualitative and Quantitative is a rather appropriate method 2    Th e m o st im po rt an t th i n g f o r th e c o n s tru c t i o n  of  a  teacher evaluation index is whether or not the content of indexes could actually reflect the evaluation result of evaluated teachers.  If the evaluated index content couldnêt be substantially described and defined, it could not really reflect the outcome of teacher evaluation D  The Method of Constructing Teacher Evaluation Indexes Teacher evaluation is always the pain inside every teacher.  No teacher will like to be evaluated. However, this policy was setup by Taiwan MOE and every school all need to execute this policy to respond to MOE.  Therefore, it is very important to construct a fair, objective system, coving the scope and depth of all aspects, preventing from subjective disturbance.  It need to cover all the contributions of every teacher substantially and abstractly to let teacher feel better about this evaluation system and will be more gladly to contribute more efforts and labors for school and students The main entity of teacher evaluation is teachers.  All the administrative units need to provide necessary resource and support to every evaluated teacher. The items and standards of teacher evaluation also should be flexible, having every collegeês uniqueness and whole schoolês overall development direction The construction of teacher evaluation indexes should substantially indicate and define every index [6 T h e  m o st  important thing for a teacher evaluation system is whether or not the content of evaluation indexes could actually reflect the expected outcome of teacher evaluation.  It usually needs to have professors from inside and outside of school to exam the effectiveness of evaluation indexes.  Later the school should hold public hearings and then submit to academic meetings for final decision and publishing.  Through such strict examine process to construct a proper teacher evaluation system   Our school first formed a professional discussion group consisted of professors from inside of school and outside of school.  After summarizing all opinions, we decided the percentage of more detailed items, the way of operation and finally formed 4 main indexes, 30 medium indexes and 189 detailed indexes in the year of 2008; and revised in the year of 2009 to 210 detailed indexes II  T HE D ATA P ROCESS OF T EACHER E VALUATION S YSTEM  The items of teacher evaluation include: teaching performance \(D 1 research with industrial cooperation \(D 2  service with counseling \(D 3 teacherês professional growth D 4 Totally there are 30 medium indexes: E 1 E 2 E 3 and E 4 E 30 189 detailed indexes : F 1 F 2 F 3 F 189 The structure is as below  Figure 1  Statistic flowchart The sum of total 189 detailed indexes of teacher evaluation is k=189, A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A i are the index weights of every detailed index, X 1 X 2z X 3 X 4 X i are the actual number of specific detailed index, I is the number of every teacherês detailed index, F 1 F 2 F 3 F 4 F k are every teacherês actual score of every detailed index 002       i i i i i X A X A X A X A X A F 1 3 3 2 2 1 1 1   1 The 30 medium indexes are E 1 E 2 E 3 E 30 Fj is the sum of every medium index, and every collegeês medium average divide by the people number of çné, the sum of every medium index is as below 002  j j i F E 1  i=1,2,3,É.,30\(medium index\        \(2 002  j j i DeptAvg F n E 1 _  1 for i=1 to 16   \(15 dept. and 1 general education center\         \(3  1 1 _ 002  j j i CollegeAvg F p E for i=1 to 5                   \(4 The 4 main indexes are D1, D2, D3, and D4, and the sum of every main index is as below, k=30, Ek is the sum of medium index of every main index.

The reasons there are so many indexes are for school to cover all the efforts teachers contributed before to get a better evaluation score.  We try to review and revise to make it become more complete and perfect A   The Analysis of Main Index of College  The purpose of teacher evaluation system is to present the performance data of teachers as references for improving teaching and future development. From figure 2 we can see the distribution chart of every college.  In the college of engineering, the department of Automation Engineering had the highest score. In the college of management, the department of Industrial Engineering and Management had the highest score.  In the college of design, the department of Space Design had the highest score; in the college of humanity and general education center, the department of Styling Cosmetology had the highest score.  After us analyzing the reason of why the department of Automation Engineering and the department of Civil Engineering had the highest average score, we found out that the teachers in these 2 departments had the most projects of cooperation with industries Table 1 show that every college had their focus points separately. We can see that the college of engineering, the college of management, and the college of design emphasized on research and cooperation with industries The college of humanity emphasized more on services and counseling. The general education center is focused on teaching only T ABLE I PERCENTAGE AND RANK OF EVERY COLLEGE IN 4 MAIN INDEXES   From figure 2 we can see the department of Automation Engineering had the highest average score of main index They had the best teaching performance and research with industrial cooperation.  For the index of service with counseling, the department of Styling Cosmetology had the highest score.  The teachers of the department of digital media design had the highest score of teacherês professional growth Because our school encourages the invention of patent and the cooperation with industries, the department of Automation Engineering and the department of Civil Engineering combined the cooperation with industries to transfer excellent patents and technologies to industries This really set up the best model of creative education.  In the year of 2008 the department of Automation Engineering had the most cases of research with industrial cooperation The department of Civil Engineering is only a little bit below the department of Automation Engineering. The department of Mechanical Engineering was ranked the third.  The teachers in the department of International Business Administration, the department of Applied Foreign Languages, the Office of Physical Education, and general education center had the lowest scores in cooperation with industries.  However, we only compare the scores of teachers in the same department.  The impact is not very serious B  Analysis of the Scores of Mmedium Index of Every Department From the figure 3 we can observe that the college of engineering had better performance in the medium item of 1.6 about government aided teaching related plans of Main Project Director, Sub-project leader, Sub-project collaboration Moderator, Subprojects of implementation, Program Moderator, Cooperative Program Host.  Every teacher had averagely 2.1 government aided teaching related plans; the college of management, 1.68; the  teaching performance research with industrial cooperation service with counseling teacherês professional growth the college of engineering 27.5%\(2\ 39.0%\(1 23.9%\(3 9.6%\(4 the college of management 28.7%\(2\ 32.1%\(1 28.3%\(3\ 10.9%\(4 the college of design 24.8%\(2\ 34.2%\(1 32.0%\(2\ 9.1%\(4 the college of humanity 34.2%\(2\ 15.4%\(3 38.0%\(1\ 12.4%\(4 the general education center 40.9%\(1\ 17.3%\(3 28.0%\(2\ 13.8%\(4

college of design, 1.05; the college of humanity, 3.13 General education center, 1.93 From figure 4 we can observe the college of design had the highest score in the index 2.1 of research plan.  Every teacher in the college of design had averagely 3.81 research cases; the college of engineering, 2.85; the college of management, 2.34; the college of humanity, 2.16; general education center, 1.14. We can observe the second highest score of cooperation with industries where the teachers of college of engineering had averagely 5 projects; the college of humanity, 3.53; the college of design, 3.39; the college of management, 2.27; general education center, 1.68 IV   S UMMARY  Under the impact of low birth rate, there are getting fewer students and government resources are available From the real data record of teacher evaluation system, those who got more budgets for research and cooperation with industries \(including project plan of NSC\ all had better evaluation scores.  Therefore, we conclude the following contributions of CTUês teacher evaluation system   Teachers need to have enthusiasm for their work; the ability to self-examine is crucial   Teachers generally understand more about the processes of teacher evaluation and by referring other teachersê last time evaluation performance to set up a future goal and direction for themselves   Those who are senior in school can provide assistance to younger teachers for mutual learning and growth   To improve teachersê ability to organize, manage and use their own teaching data to vitalize teaching A  Application of Evaluation Result We use the result of teacher evaluation as the reference for the directions of teachersê growth to improve teaching and uplift the effectiveness of studentsê learning   From our teachersê evaluation data to discover the problems of the teachers in school work   The completeness of evaluation indexes could evaluate the conditions of teachersê professional growth   With both qualities and quantities to provide rich result of teacher evaluation system B  Future Development and Suggestions   To generate timely feedbacks and assist the revised processes of evaluation system   School managers should create a harmonious, fair and reasonable environment by not focusing on using evaluation as a tool to exam teachers working here.  It is better for our school to create an environment to gather all teachersê attentions to work together so that the school can become a place for teachers to develop themselves and have their dreams come true R EFERENCES  1  National Teachers Council, çTeacher Notes Posts teacher evaluation methodé, 1995 2  J.

responsibilities of what Gartner 2 calls a BI Competency Centre \(BICC\ [12    A BICC is often defined as a cross-functional team with specific tasks, roles, responsibilities and processes for supporting and promoting the effectiveness of BI. The MIR essentially took up five roles [2, 12  First, it took care of all BI-related education and training. Promoting and rewarding the consistent use of these information products throughout the organisation was also an important objective Second, it performed enterprise project management tasks. This included overseeing the process for intake and prioritisation of BI projects, as well as enabling user-supported requirements analysis, prototyping and pilot testing. The MIR also took care of the development, roll-out and subsequent support of information products, often by bringing in externally sourced help Third, the MIR acted as a data steward. Important issues were the management of the meta-data and the quality of the data input Fourth, the MIR was also available to address very specific ad hoc information requests that required, for example, the application of advanced analytical techniques. The MIR s expert analysts would then prioritise and handle these information requests Fifth, the MIR maintained and further developed the enterprise data warehouse architecture, linking different sources into data marts, which in turn were connected to engines for analytics and reporting  4.3. Information Brokerage  A second organisational role was that of the Information Brokers, also known as business-IT hybrids t h e AA PD In f o r m at i o n Brok ers were sourced largely from within the police force to liaise, orchestrate and facilitate communication between different stakeholders. These officers had knowledge of both policing and information management Pawlowski and Robey ttribu t e In f o r m ation Brokers a facilitating role in the knowledge process flow concerning IT and business practices across the boundaries that separate work units within organisations. Here is the Information Broker s role in a nutshell 1  Information Brokers are mandated to cross the boundaries, share information and leverage resources   2  For more information on Gartner, please visit their website http://www.gartner.com  2  Through a wider view of the business activities, the Information Broker surfaces and challenges assumptions, stimulates reflection, and assesses the impact of suggested change on the organisation 3  Information Brokers are able to reframe explain and clarify information. Information Brokers also help bridge the gap between business groups \(e.g. police officers\ and the IT department \(e.g. MIR 4  End user involvement, sponsorship and commitment are essential to project success Here, the role of the Information Broker is to liaise between the various actors and pursue goal congruence  The AAPD had about 20 Information Brokers whose role was similar to that of a business analyst  in many organisations. They were supposed to stay close to the officers at the different levels through personal contacts and presence in management meetings First, Information Brokers helped superior officers translate strategy and communicate decisions to their subordinates. For example, performance against corps management s priorities were systematically updated and tracked in all reports This enabled quicker reactions to limit discrepancies between observed and anticipated crime trends In addition, Information Brokers helped consolidate the feedback from the lower level officers and send it back up the line. By being present at meetings and steering committees all over the AAPD Information Brokers could help lower levels to direct the attention of higher level police management towards emerging hot spots or deviations from the projections   Furthermore, Information Brokers were responsible for picking up the semi-structured and unstructured requests for potential information products and relay them to the MIR. They would assist in further fleshing out the requests, and, once the information products had been developed, they would help colleagues interpret, improve and work with the historical and anticipated crime facts that would be reported In this way, they played a central role in lubricating the channels of enterprise-wide knowledge sharing and development with respect to the use of the operationalised BI capabilities     Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 
 


 Figure 2. Components of the police management processes at the AAPD \(based on Eckerson, 2006   4.4. Two information products for capacity management: ILP in action  During our interviews, police officers across the organisation confirmed that capacity management was one of their most challenging, yet critical responsibilities within the law enforcement pillar of the AAPD Capacity management refers to determining which and how many police resources need to be made available in what parts of the AAPD region and when In the past, these decisions \(made at all three sublevels of the AAPD\ad been based on perceptions of past experiences and seasonal crime trends held by senior and less senior officers, in combination with local ambitions and sensitivities In line with the ILP goals, the AAPD developed a capability for integrated, reliable and actionable intelligence to support the capacity management decisions. This would integrate the different levels and support a rapid, flexible and focused deployment of the available policing capacity towards the areas and types of crime that needed them the most Two information products the Early Warning System and the Data Detective tool illustrate how the different components \(both the technical and the organisational components\ worked together to support ILP at the AAPD Figure 2 shows how these two key applications connect different aspects of police decision making as a performance management problem. The MIR and the Information Brokers are located on the knowledge-sharing arrows between the different performance management activities Technically, on top of the enterprise data warehouse, the MIR had installed an automated information processing cap ability, called the Early Warning System. The system collected data from different historical crime report repositories and kept a record of how current crime rates were running against the projected figures based on a\istorical data and b\he objectives set by the different decision-making levels. The outputs of the Early Warning System were indicators that highlighted significant deviations from the projected figures. As shown in Figure 2, the system s main function was monitoring, though it could also be used for deeper analyses by navigating through the data of the different levels The Data Detective tool had more detailed analysis and reporting capabilities \(see Figure 2 fact replaced the local manual work of the so-called dotters Dotters were police officers who would locate reported crimes on large printed maps by means of dots and thumbnails. The Data Detective tool would do the same, but: a\t was based on integrated data across the different levels, and b presented the information by means of visually enriched data navigation and deep analysis functionalities. It pinpointed the main crime hot spots on a map to inform resourcing decisions. For example, through this tool the officers could drill down in the data to identify travelling burglary gang activities Organisationally, the MIR and Information Brokers supported the knowledge flows between the different activities For example, the MIR took care of automating the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 
 


information flows, distributing scorecards and notifications via the intranet to the different decision makers in the organisation. As for the Data Detective tool with its advanced analytical functionalities, a number of expert analysts within the MIR made the necessary analyses. In addition to answering ad hoc information requests, a monthly report summarising the most frequent questions was made available via the intranet. Next to sharing the information, the MIR kept the tools relevant and attractive to users The Information Brokers would sit in on corps district, and neighbourhood capacity management meetings to: a\ick up on new informational needs b\elp with the interpretation of the designed reports and c\mmunicate common or contradicting capacity management trends between the levels  5  Summary and Discussion   By installing both BI technology and its organisational complements, the AAPD built, and stimulated the continuous improvement of, an operationalised BI environment in support of their ILP vision. The following four building blocks were crucial in their approach [based on 9, 10, 36  First of all, adequate attention was given to the data foundation. The value of, for example, standard naming conventions, a normalised data structure clear-cut meta-data, superior data quality and unambiguous data ownership across the chain of contacts cannot be overestimated. This responsibility was allotted to the MIR, who functions as a BICC, a centre of excellence for information management practices at the AAPD Second, it was insightful to promote a culture where data would be regarded as a corporate asset. At the AAPD, the new Chief of Police clearly subscribed to the ILP philosophy to complement intuition-led policing with facts and figures on crime Third, the role of the Information Brokers was essential in managing the knowledge flows at the AAPD and acting as the go-between linking the different levels in the organisation Finally, the success of the information products such as Early Warning and Data Detective, depended on constantly creating, evolving and recreating the fit between the technological capabilities, the organisational needs and the existing organisational capabilities. The MIR and the Information Brokers played a pivotal role in effectuating this dynamic state of business-IT alignment Still, apart from describing a working operationalised BI and ILP setting, we also wish to take a first step in filling a perceived gap in academic research into ILP and operationalised BI systems in practice. Generally speaking, the operationalised BI/ILP environment at the AAPD can be described by using established information science theory For example, Markus and Robey tin gu i s h three basic perspectives on the interaction between the organisation, individuals and technology: the technological imperative, the organisational imperative, and the emergent perspective. This case study clearly fits within the third perspective. The emergent perspective holds that the uses and consequences of IT emerge unpredictably from complex social interactions In this case, neither technology nor the organisation in itself provided the impetus to drive ILP within the AAPD Moreover, in accordance with Orlikowski the case also illustrates how the AAPD sustained the evolution of the system by supporting a redefinition and modification of the meaning, properties and applications of technology after initial development The maturity of the technology i.e. that of the data warehouse as well as that of the information products is then an ever-evolving state Still, we believe that two comments in connection with the particular nature of BI systems need to be made. That is, BI is a system whose goal is more of an informational nature, i.e. to deliver better information to constituents. This contrasts with systems that are more of a transactional nature, i.e designed to automate standard processes and series of actions We believe that, from an information science perspective, understanding such informational initiatives like ILP and, by extension, operationalised BI can benefit from framing them in: a\ enterprisewide view of the systems and systems goals, and b\ a knowledge-based perspective on business-IT alignment First, during our interviews, the MIR staff members and the Information Brokers regularly emphasised the difficulty of striking a delicate balance between the enterprise-wide need for integration and the immediate operational information needs of individual officers. Still, the AAPD seemed to be managing quite well with their enterprise-wide performance management vision, in this case ILP, supported by top management and cascaded by MIR and Information Broker functions There appears to be a risk for organisations that develop an operational BI environment incrementally While there are the so-called maturity models published in popular literature \(e.g. the information evolution model by Davis et al. [1  w ith t h e  exception of Watson ic  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 
 


attention has been given to the organisational evolution of such an environment. More specifically not much emphasis has been placed on the practices of realising the essential enterprise-wide intentions that are embedded in the technical capabilities of the BI system \(e.g. data integration, information sharing etc The AAPD showed how an enterprise performance management philosophy such as ILP could form a unifying theme under which operationalised BI capabilities were developed sustained and integrated through an enterprise-wide network of connected technical components and shared organisational processes and go-betweens Consequently, we contend that research into operationalising BI should not be blinded by enterprise goals, by remaining all too functionally oriented in its applications or by focusing on the masses rather than the enterprise. We therefore believe it necessary for current theories and definitions positioning operationalising BI to target better enterprise management as their aim Secondly, the informational nature of the system makes it especially well-suited for knowledge-based investigations into the combination of organisational and technical components that surround the enactment of the system For example, Nissen et al tin g u ish sharing from non-sharing knowledge management activities. The former implies organising, formalising and distributing knowledge \(e.g. by codifying project management best practices in a manual\he latter entails creating, applying and evolving knowledge e.g. setting up cross-functional working groups to tackle specific problems At the AAPD, the MIR \(as a BICC\ and the Information Brokers played important roles in both sharing and non-sharing knowledge management activities. For example, to enable correct interpretation of the data and to stimulate self-help the MIR held training and education sessions \(a sharing knowledge management activity\. But it was also the task of both the Information Brokers and the MIR to safeguard the fact that the information products were designed for user-friendly reporting such as displaying geographically referenced information \(rather a non-sharing activity\oting Bush information does not become knowledge until the receiver understands what it is they are receiving      6  Conclusion  This paper has offered a descriptive account of the set-up of the AAPD s operationalised BI environment for ILP as it presented itself in the spring of 2007. As illustrated through the capacity management example, they had built an environment where police officers at the different decision-making levels could use fact-based, integrated and aligned intelligence as a complement to their intuition Although this paper is essentially descriptive in nature, we believe that two suggestions can be made to guide future research into operationalised BI environments First of all, the AAPD s approach contrasts with merely pursuing locally optimised operationalised BI tooling efforts for lower-level employees. Secondly this paper also suggests a path for possible academic research by applying knowledge-based techniques to these specific informational contexts Therefore, we believe in the further application of knowledge-based perspectives to settings with operationalised BI ambitions. For example, while the BICC has been taken up as a concept by vendors consultants and the like \(e.g. Miller et al  academic research into the "what" and the "how of specific organisational mechanisms that can serve as catalysts for executing on the informational promises will prove instrumental This paper is only a small step along the way, as it is descriptive and based on a rich but single case study of a specific situation. Still, given the increasing popularity in the market for operational BI technologies, we foresee the relevancy of research on this topic growing only greater in future  Acknowledgements  This research was supported by Vlerick Leuven Gent Management School s Chartered Research Programme on Business Intelligence.

Although a real-world implementation is yet to be developed, the applicability issue of the proposed method has been taken into consideration z Data Availability Nowadays, more and more IEDs are being installed in the substations. Besides performing their designed functions, these IEDs often record data that can be used for other monitoring and control purposes. For instance an IED may be capable of recording event reports and analog and binary values similar to disturbance recorders and making it available in real-time z Time Response Issue Although the two-level alarm processing structure incurs delay in analysis due to the need of IED data retrieval and telecommunication, the length of delay is usually still acceptable. The initiation command of SAP and the data transmission of SAP results back to the control center are expected to take only a few seconds. While waiting for the results from SAPs, the EMS-level Alarm Processor \(EAP preliminary analysis results done at the EMS level on time-sensitive alarms. After the SAP results arrive they may replace the original simple alarms with a single one that gives the consolidated information on what happened The most important difference of the proposed alarm processor from the existing ones is its idea of looking into substation IED data to support additional 


into substation IED data to support additional reasoning. Most existing alarm processors use different approaches to suppress the number of alarms prompted to the dispatcher and analyze the sequence of events based on the information available in the alarm messages. Although many alarms are recorded in the control center during an event, they are usually received independently from different measuring devices and the correlation of different alarms to a specific event often imposes a hard task. This can be easily overcome by providing GPS synchronization at the source of data, which makes correlating the alarms to the originating event quite easy [26]. By creating a two-level analysis structure and using the substation IED data as a source of information, the analysis becomes much efficient, mainly because the additional amount of information available  5. Conclusions  This paper firstly reviews the existing research on Intelligent Alarm Processing, and points out the disadvantages on the conventional approaches. They mostly rely on direct representation of raw alarm points which becomes overwhelming to observe and interpret when operating the system under stressed conditions This requires implementing new alarm processor to help the operator deal with the tremendous amount alarms by effectively converting raw data to useful information. Two novel Intelligent Alarm     Processing options are proposed to illustrate the new possibilities coming from integrating operational and nonoperational data in real time The FRPN diagnosis model is analogous to an expert system whose rule-base is separated from its inference engine, which can be built in advance based on power system and protection system configurations and stored in files. In such a way, the FRPN models can be easily modified according to the changes of input data as well as power system and protection system configuration This solution uses primarily SCADA data and does not need detailed data from substation IEDs except trip and logic operand information from protective relays In the second proposed approach, two-level processing structure includes Energy Management EMS SAS solutions. The SAS-level alarm processor uses measurement data that are only available within the substation and is capable of recognizing the nature of disturbance in the substation. More detailed analysis functions can be finished in reasonable time by converting data into information at the data source.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
