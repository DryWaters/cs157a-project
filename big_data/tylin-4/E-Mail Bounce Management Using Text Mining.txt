collection of customer e-mail addresses to an asset of important business value in order to provide customers the right offer at the right point in time Besides the design and content of an e-mail campaign the e-mail-transportation process is of critical importance to really reach your potential customer. Possible errors in the transportation can be of either permanent Ö hardbounces Ö or temporary nature Ö softbounces With the trans portation error communication by internet-s ervice-providers lacking of compliance to existing standards, companies face the problem of having inaccurate information regarding 
deliverability. And quite often this results in the blocking of actually intact potential customer addresses Therefore a model processing bounce messages and predicting the possibility of deliverability using semantic information obtained through text mining and the embedded Singular Value Decomposition is presented. We discuss the application of text mining tools regarding error messages and apply a multistaged decision model that minimizes the falsenegative-rate to discard addresses with permanent non-deliverability from the database while identifying addresses that maintain business value although being bounced  1. Introduction  
Among direct marketers the online channel e-mail is gaining more and more importance for the purpose of customer information and communication. Convincing characteristics are the relatively opportune prices, a very high time-to-market velocity and the extensive possibilities of customer and target group individual personalization. Therefore there is no question that email marketing can be considered as the channel of most vigorous growth in direct marketing While the amount of e-mails sent is continuously increasing, the number of e-mails not reaching 
addressed recipients due to errors in the transportation process is also rising. This results in losses of turnover depending on addressability Addressing this issue the present paper chapter 2 at first provides an introduction to the e-mail campaign process before in chapter 3 the technical fundamentals of the e-mail transportation and error communication are elaborated, mentioning current inconsistency issues While having a critical look at the error communication in practice it becomes clear that an automated analysis on basis of supposed standards is not feasible, making a semantic analysis of error messages mandatory 
Therefore in chapter 4 we present the construction of a model predicting the possibility of deliverability POD\ e-mail address using decision trees targeting on improvement of addressability and mentioned turnovers. The semantic information is therefore extracted from the error messages using text mining to obtain structured, machine-analysable information out of the unstructured text. Within the state-of-the-art data mining process the embedded text mining uses the singular value decomposition \(SVD 
transform the semantic information, providing a very efficient way of representing the content of error messages and the input for the POD forecasting model In this process we discuss in detail the application of text mining tools and their configuration regarding error messages in the e-mail transportation process Following this approach an improvement of turnovers can be realized by decreasing false-negative classification while at the same time providing a faster process of classification  2. E-Mail campaign process 
 With the increasing importance of the e-mail channel a marketer s collection of customer e-mail addresses is evolving to an asset of highly relevant business value in customer communication in order to address the right offer at the right point in time to the right customer. The process of addressing a customer is outlined in the following, and illustrates the steps to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 
 


taken in order to obtain a customer reaction in form of reading, clicking within the e-mail or purchasing linked products and the basis for further analysis The company strategy implements a marketing strategy, using e-mail marketing and derived e-mail campaigns as one possible instrument to address customers d in tens i f y c o m m unication 2]. Opting on e-mail marketing the process loop of e-mail campaigns illustrated in figure 1 is entered, consisting of the main phases planning, execution and analysis   Within the planning phase at first the objectives of the campaign are formulated before target groups and corresponding treatments are defined. Then the campaign plan can be compiled and required e-mail addresses can be obtained. The planning phase results in the definition of the e-mail concept including tactical objectives regarding communication frequency and tonality The execution phase starts with the production of email content, such as commercial or informative texts and pictures or graphics in the case of HTML e-mails before both programming of the e-mail and the selection and export of target group data follow Programming the e-mail implies the formulation of the individual design of every e-mail regarding components like header, images, products etc. At the same time the data of customers within the addressed target groups is selected and exported into an operational database. Optionally the e-mail then runs through an internal test of programming and data consistency and/or a live pre-test checking the real response on selected components of the e-mail e.g products, header, layout allowing to adapt to current customer behaviour. After the successful completion of the testing rounds, the sending process begins where the programmed e-mails and the provided customer data are assembled, mostly using specialized hard- and software systems to meet requirements regarding overall volume of the campaign and assembly logics   After having sent the e-mail it is up to the customer to react. Certainly, the customer is only able to do so, if the e-mail finds its way into the mailbox we explain the e-mail transport in detail later on The customer reaction and the tracked cases of noreaction due to errors are the basis for the analysis phase. During analysis phase at first key performances indicators \(KPI\lated, allowing the identification of successful components and factors of the campaign. Directly afterwards the process, sales and interaction KPIs are used to withdraw Lessons Learned from the completed campaign to positively affect future campaign processes and to close the campaign loop  3. E-Mail transportation  Besides the content and design related implementation of e-mails taking advantage of the email channels benefits requires a detailed consideration of the e-mail transportation process The transportation process by standard follows the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol \(SMTP\ or the related and encrypted Secure SMTP T h e e-m a il s y s t e m  is  divided in two sub-systems t h e u s er a g e n t U A   allowing to write and read e-mails \(e.g. MS Outlook Thunderbird etc.\ and the message transfer agent MTA\sporting the mail from the author to the addressee. These processes are executed in the background of the computer system and emerge when receiving a note from a recipient system Mailer Daemon saying e.g unknown user For the transport of a mail created by the UA via the internet the sender MTA acts as the client and connects to Port 25 of the target system using the Transfer Communication Protocol \(TCP\The target system of course is able to interpret the incoming SMTP and then acts as the server Figure 1.

 3.1. Transportation according to RFC 2821  The e-mail transport process is documented in the internet standard RFC 2821 [7 con s is ts of pos iti v e  or negative server replies to the client commands which is due to the successful completion of the command. The positive or negative server reply is obligatory in the communication process, determining the next command on the part of the client. The usual e-mail transmission process presents itself as follows After establishing the connection to the server the client initiates the communication with the HELO or EHLO command, identifying him. Then the transport begins with the MAIL command, within which the server receives information about the sender using RCPT commands. The DATA command then starts the transfer of the message content, which can be aborted from client side using the RSET command. After the transfer has been completed, following the VRFY commend the server checks that the address is assigned to a user or an account. Sending a positive reply the client sends the commands NOOP and QUIT to close the connection and finalize the e-mail transmission. In the case of a negative reply the HELP command asks the server for more information about the existing accounts  3.2. Error reporting  Transporting the e-mail to the corresponding account of the server in the most cases is done by a Mail Delivery Agent \(MDA\which is part of the mail server just like the MTA The transportation of the e-mail can only happen, if the MTA of the server is online. To assure this further services like Post Office Protocol 3 \(POP3\ternet Message Protocol \(IMAP\ight be implemented at servers of international e-mail providers, acting as 24/7 online MTAs Errors occurring in the transportation process see figure 2 are submitted to the client either by the MTA or the MDA. Firstly the server MTA checks its responsibility by analysing the addressee domain and reports any error to the client MTA. If the connection to the server MTA fails from the beginning the client receives a SMTP reply indicating the refused status Other communication errors are labelled bounced by the server and reported via SMTP to the client. If an error occurs within the target system, it is reported by the MTA or the MDA, depending on the system configuration. In the following both refused and bounced are referred to as bounce For messages indicating bounces reporting standards do exist. These are the server replies proposed in the already mentioned RFC d in  RFC A ccordi n g  t o R F C 0821 [10 w h i c h i s  the antecessor of the current RFC 2821, replies on SMTP commands allow the synchronisation of requests and actions. Therefore an SMTP command or reply consists of a triple-digit followed by text, where the digits are intended to be used for automated processing of the reply and the text explains to the human operator the action taken. For automated processing of the error message, meanings are assigned to the different digits Regarding bounce messages the most important number is the first digit, with its values of 4XX or 5XX  5 indicates a permanent error and 4 a temporary error in the transportation process \(for details please refe R F C 2821 f u rth e r m ore provides 14 standard error messages, but at the same time mentions, that these might not be able to keep up with possible changes in the server communication Therefore in 2003 RFC w a s p u bl i s h e d  containing a proposal for the enhancement of the error communication formulated in RFC 2821.

new error codes within RFC 2821, while the problem of mostly system specific text content in the messages persists Referring to RFC 0821 RFC 1893 [1 ready  introduces so called Delivery Status Notifications DSN\dicating errors in the transportation process within the mail server system, which have been updated by RFC 3463 in 2003, expanding the possibilities for standardized e rror messaging: the first digit maintained the possible values of 2.yyy.zzz  4.yyy.zzz and 5.yyy.zzz  no error, temporary error, permanent error while the second and third digit evolved to triple digits each. These errors are referred to in practice as hardbounces when being of permanent character, while errors of temporary character are called softbounces. Just like RFC 2821 RFC 3463 provides 98 error standards for both errors of temporary and permanent character. The DNS is optionally added behind the triple-digit of the SMTP communication  3.3. Inconsistencies within error reporting  Regarding RFC 2821 and RFC 3463 it is noted, that these standards provide an idealistic framework for error communication in the e-mail transportation process. But since the unsolicited compliance to these frameworks, their implementation strongly depends on the mail server administrators. This fact is the reason for constructing a bounce classification model to deal with the problems deriving from the reporting inconsistency Bounces are always reported to the sending system which in case of a company practicing e-mail campaigns usually is a specialized e-mail application service provider \(ASP\here the bounce messages are classified as soft- or hardbounce according to the first digit of the SMTP reply. The classification has definitely become more sophisticated but it seems that there is still little effort to introduce a common obligatory standard on behalf of e-mail providers. This causes inconsistencies, when the marketer uses two or more ASPs to send their e-mail campaigns, due to different classification algorithms. Practice also showed that there is little knowledge about existing RFC standards and the proposed structure of communication errors These factors result in the observations shown in Table 1, representing a cross tabulation of ASP classification on basis of errors from the same pool of e-mail addresses. The values in the diagonal axis from the upper left to the lower right corner indicate a consistent classification by both ASPs, e.g. both classify 58% of the same bounces as hardbounces, and 5% as softbounces. The inconsistency in the classification can be observed in the lower left and upper right cells, where 19% of the bounces are indicated as softbounces by ASP 1 while being classified as hardbounces by ASP 2, respectively 2 are indicated as hardbounces by ASP 1 while being classified as softbounces by ASP 2  Table 1. ASP classification comparison ASP 1 ASP 2 hardbounce no bounce softbounce hard 58 0 2 no bounce 1 13 0 soft 19 2 5  It becomes obvious, that the classification of bounces differs considerably regarding soft- and hardbounces. Imagining the turnover loss through deleting wrongly classified e-mail addresses with only a temporary error from the campaign potential, an internal classification process becomes mandatory Doing so, the marketer is independent from the ASPs classifications and might regain some of the already wrongly deleted addresses As outlined before an automated processing of the SMTP codes is not feasible due do possible inconsistencies in the assigned meaning, it becomes obvious, that the complete error message and its semantic has to be used to derive a utilizable classification model  4. Bounce classification model  According to the standard data mining process the classification model development is structured into the phases of task definition, selection of relevant data data preparation in this particular case including text mining modelling and modelling of the decision model before further measures to be taken are mentioned  4.1. Task definition  The objective of the model is the prediction of the probability of a successful delivery to an e-mail address within the next campaign. Therefore both the semantic information of the error messages extracted by text mining techniques and the chronological sequence of the error messages are used. The POD is calculated using decision trees, to build a decision model classifying all e-mail addresses with bounces within maximum three tries. By that the hardbouncesoftbounce classification is to be improved, deriving a lower false-negative-rate that means less wrong Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 
 


classifications of actual softbounces as hardbounces  resulting in a higher turnover potential  4.2. Selection of relevant data  According to the task defin ition the requirements in terms of data are the following   Crude SMTP responses which are provided by campaign ASPs   Sequence of delivery of a predefined e-mail address pool that is analyzed; the e-mail addresses have been addressed consecutively to observe the sequence of deliverability \(see figure 3   4.3. Data preparation text mining  The main process of the data preparation is the text mining of the bounce messages where the SVD is used to obtain structured numeric data out of the unstructured text. In this project we used the SAS Text Miner 3.1 embedded in the SAS Enterprise Miner 9.1 data mining environment Commonly text mining software uses a vector space model for the representation of text or synonymously documents in this case the error messages. As illustrated in figure 4, the error messages are represented in a high-dimensional space where the terms chart the dimensions and texts are represented as dots within the space of contained terms  Using the vector space model the semantic information of the text cannot be saved, a fact that stands against a winning efficiency of representing text numerically. Therefore texts are represented by vectors of length n, where n is the number of unique terms within the text document. Doing this for m documents a n ◊ m term-document-frequency matrix A is obtained representing the text collection. Usually A is a sparse matrix, containing many zeros, because only few terms of the document collection are present in a single document The content of A is adjusted by weight functions taking into account the frequency of a term: Local and global weights can be applied [14 o cal w e i g h t s bear on the frequency of a term within the document, while global weight functions are related to the term frequency in the document collection The similarity of vectors, and therewith the represented documents can be compared calculating the scalar product of the vectors. Without considering weights, figure 5 illustrates an example where 2 is the similarity value between the first and the second error message, while the similarity value between the first and the third error message is 4 On basis of the terms contained in both of the analyzed vectors of the collection this is the so called co-occurrenc It  can be said, that the first and the third document are more similar than the first and the second since the scalar product of co-occurring terms is the same in case of message one and three The dimensions of the sparse matrix A are reduced to become more processible for hard- and software resources. Reducing the dimensions means a reduction of the terms n determining the matrix. Especially terms without informational content like conjugations are in the focus of this measure which is referred to as a Stop List Moreover, also a Start List can be introduced Figure 3.

containing predefined terms that are of relevance to the analysis, and by that limiting the vector space. Another option is a Roll Up of terms which have a weight above a certain threshold The factorization of the matrix by means of the SVD is a very elegant way to reduce dimensionality The SVD allows to concentrate on the informative terms and rewrite the original sparse matrix A as a dense matrix A k This is done as follows   The term-document-frequency matrix A is rewritten as t V U A  where U is a dense orthogonal r n  matrix is a diagonal r r   matrix containing the singular values. V is a dense orthogonal m r  matrix   Per definition the singular vales in are sorted with descending values from the upper left cells The singular values represent the characteristics of A    The matrix A is represented by a sum of first order matrices t i i r i i v u A   0     The approximation of A results from a choice of r k  leading to the matrix t k k k t i i k i i k V U v u A A     0  with reduced dimensionality Figure 6 illustrates the difference between the common term elimination reducing the term-documentfrequency matrix of term b and the optimized approximation using the SVD. The SVD minimizes the relevance of uninformative terms and termcombinations by computing new dimensions representing the similarity among terms and with that their importan The SVD is applied to the error messages of the email transportation process. The used text mining software is currently only able to process text in one language at the same time. Since the majority of error messages are written in English by Internet Service Providers \(ISP\, this language configuration has been chosen. Besides the SVD obviously uninformative terms can be eliminated from the term-document matrix, accelerating the SVD calculation. A very useful functionality to reduce dimensionality without losing informational content is the Stem Terms method. Terms are ascripted to their original stem, counting found  and find as the same term in the document collection Due to the fact that the error messages are quite short and the vocabulary limited, functionalities such as the emphasis of terms that appear in only one document become dispensable. Also the software solutions offer the configuration of recognition of numbers and punctuations Since the DNS will be integrated in the analysis later on number and punctuation recognition at this stage are disabled. The software also provides a detection of Different Parts of Speech able to differentiate among verbs, adjectives, nouns, numbers etc., and to Ignore Parts of Speech excluding selected word groups. Considering the orthography of the English language, the recognition of Noun Groups is very important to connect the single consecutive terms user and account to the intended term user account  Find Entities is another option to detect names, addresses or telephone numbers and can be used to identify domains in the context of bounce messages Although most of the error messages are in English there are many bilingual bounces, containing the same text in English and since the project was conducted in Germany German, or even only in German. With the configuration English chosen for Text Mining, these messages would falsely be interpreted as different and unknown although representing the same content, just in another language. A possibility to correctly integrate the German terms is the use of a Synonym List Here the German unknown terms are declared synonyms of their corresponding English terms: Accordingly, the term Benutzer is correctly counted as user It could be argued that the synonym list cannot contain the translation of all the terms existing in the document collection. Yet, as mentioned before, the vocabulary of the bounce messages is very limited, justifying this pragmatic approach Figure 6.

Additionally the synonym list is enhanced by the integration of all DNS defined in RFC 2821 and RFC 3463, so that number and punctuation recognition become redundant in terms of detecting reporting standards The precedent parse configurations are a first step towards dimension reduction while the structured numeric representation of text is obtained using the SVD, which is very versatile in its configurability. The dimensionality of the SVD can be predetermined. We use a high SVD Resolution due to the relatively low original dimensionality in the error messages compared to text mining through books or any other collection of larger documents Regarding the Max SVD Dimensions Albright suggests to ecreate 50 to 250 dimensions. In this modelling project best results regarding misclassification were obtained with 150 dimensions without using the option Scale SVD Dimensions which would have emphasized terms that are contained very often in very few documents The local Frequency Weights available are a logarithmic or binary weight besides no weight at all Having a close look at the error messages, it becomes clear, that the binary weight is the most appropriate in considering the fact of many bilingual messages. The same term in two languages is weighed as 1 using the binary weight, saying Yes, the term occurred in the message, but it does not matter if it was once or more often Using a logarithmic weight would distort the calculation in the wrong direction, taking into consideration the counted frequency of the term, not just the occurrence. Having a look at the misclassification rate, this thesis was confirmed and the binary weight was employed To not abet certain term frequencies over the document collection the global Term Weight chosen was the simple count of terms over the collection Text mining software provides a very useful tool to gain insight into the main characteristics of the text documents: text clustering. Choosing an automated clustering with or without a predetermined amount of clusters delivers an impression of coherences calculated on basis of the SVD dimensions. In our project we have defined the calculation of clusters with five Descriptive Terms to describe the cluster concisely as shown in table 2 The clusters illustrate the co-occurrence of terms very well. It can be assumed, that clusters 3, 5, and 6 contain e-mail addresses that are subjected to permanent errors due to clear ASP classification rates as hardbounces with the explanatory terms inactive  not valid and disable perfectly describing the nature of the error. The other clusters are indicating only temporary errors softbounces when looking at the softer descriptive terms like currently  deliver and volume Taking into consideration the classification of ASPs it becomes obvious, that the classification of hardbounces is quite successful with almost 100% in every cluster, the classification of softbounces on the other hand is not that distinct, e.g. in cluster 4. These are the messages that can make the difference in the following decision model towards an improved bounce management and a lower beta error in the classification process  Table 2. Bounce clusters  To consider the sequence of error messages of the analysed e-mail addresses the calculated SVD dimensions table is transformed accordingly, and a binary target variable is derived, marking a successful delivery with 0 and faulty tries of delivery with 1   4.4. Modeling  The POD of the e-mail addresses is calculated on the basis of three consecutive responses resulting from delivery tries using decision trees The data is subdivided into training, validating and test data to train the model, validate the model quality and test it on real data. The target variable for each try is the previously defined deliverability while the explaining variables are all available SVD dimensions before that try We applied decision trees because of their well known benefits of being easily interpretable and visu er decis ion trees are able to process both interval and nominal scaled data, making the model extensible with all types of new variables. In this paper however we are not going into detail regarding the chosen type of tree cluster descriptive terms  of bounces  ASP softbounce ASP hardbounce 1 currently, email subject, invalid recipient 5.15% 78.89 21.11 2 deliver, recipient mail, following subject 38.72% 72.18 27.82 3 user, inactive 10.11 0.04 99.96 4 local, exceed volume, limit allowed 12.24% 60.73 39.27 5 user account unknown, not valid 28.45% 0.10 99.90 6 delivery, delivery error, account user, disable 5.32% 0.38 99.62 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 
 


In this project, we used the following configurations provided that the misclassification rate is kept minimal As Split Criterion the Persons Chi-Square statistic was employed Missing Values were not refused because every successful delivery lacks of a calculated SVD dimension, constituting an attribute that carries actual information. To keep the tree clearly arranged without losing too much information through intervals, the branch maximum was set to five The quality of the implemented decision trees regarding misclassification error and Sum of Squared Errors is shown in table 3. It is obvious that with an increasing number of computable SVD dimensions  adding 150 SVD dimensions after every delivery try  the model improves itself. The PODs calculated by the trees are now the basis for the decision model  Table 3.

Decision Model  Objective of the decision model is a faster and better classification in comparison to the established model, which follows the common standard to analyse three bounces in a row, before deciding digitally upon the deliverability of an e-mail address. In order to get there, we built a stepwise decision model, which is able to classify an e-mail address in terms of its deliverability within not only after three consecutive delivery tries \(see figure 7\ter the first response \(R 1\which has to be a bounce, the e-mail address enters the classification process. On basis of the first response the POD for the next delivery try is calculated for all addresses not being classified right after this initial bounce. Then the second response \(R 2\ enhances the model, serving for a further classification of e-mails, while some still stay in the model, where the POD for the third try is calculated On basis of this final third response \(R 3\ses are classified Quality marks for the determination of the classification intervals on each decision level are the false-negative rate \(FNR\d the overall classification rate. The FNR is the most important mark since it is extremely important on behalf of the marketer to minimize the amount of e-mail addresses being classified as permanent un-addressable although being addressable or temporarily un-addressable  meaning a loss of e-mail address potential for further campaigns e th e FN R t h e a m o u n t of false-negative classified addresses can be decreased or the amount of all negative classified addresses can be increased, both possible in this decision model In order to prevent blacklisting a blocking of an IP address on behalf of the ISP due to trespassing a defined threshold of hardbounces the model should also provide a fast classification of bounced e-mail addresses. So another quality mark is the overall classification rate \(CR\ on each decision level In an iterative process the classification intervals have been determined in consideration of mentioned quality marks. The results of this process are provided in table 4  Table 4. Configuration and quality marks   Accordingly, more than 30% of the bounces are classified after the first response with a very low FNR of 0.18% by applying the classification intervals from 0% to 5% POD and 70% to 100% POD. After the second response 77% are classified by application of the classification intervals from 0% to 10% POD and 90% to 100% POD having a FNR of still low 2.15  R 1  R2 R 3  overall quality mark FNR 0.18% 2.15% 15.05% 2.91 CR 30.49% 77.34 100 100 classification intervals 0;x 0;0.05\ [0;0.1\ [0;0.25  y;1 0.7;1  0 9 1   0 2 5  1    Figure 7.

The last classification step has to decide upon the bounce status for all of the remaining addresses. By determining the threshold at 25% POD the  classification intervals assign the hardbounce or softbounce status for the remaining addresses obtaining a 100% classified addresses after the third response and a FNR of 15.05%. The overall FNR attained is 2.91%, which is an improvement of almost 1% regarding the established model not using text mining, while at the same time the classification speed could be raised by introducing classification intervals after the first and second response  4.6. Impacts of the text mining decision model  The direct impact of the decision model using text mining in comparison to a standard model is illustrated in figure 8. The standard model decides on behalf of three responses whether errors regarding an e-mail address are of permanent or temporary nature a procedure derived from ASPs requirements of generating at least three hardbounces per e-mail address. On the other hand the new model does not wait that long. Starting with the first response it is able to classify e-mail addresses resulting in less time to take the appropriate action. Furthermore the FNR which is of great importance to marketers since it represents potential e-mail address responders that are blocked by the model, is lower than before due to the use of semantic information that was not used before The False Positive Rate \(FPR\ is of less importance and not optimized, representing e-mail addresses with permanent errors that are classified as softbounces  4.7. Definition of consequential measures  The project could have been ended with the implementation of the decision model. Yet a very important aspect should not be forgotten: the further treatment of the classified e-mail addresses. Especially regarding the addresses labelled as permanently unaddressable a post-processing seems recommendable since the addressees have given their explicit admission to be contacted with commercial e-mail, but now remain locked in the database. Therefore we suggest an immediate contacting of the customer using another channel such as call centre, print or website in correspondence with respective costs of communication, to verify the e-mail address and the admission given. Without a reaction to this measure within a three week period it is suggested to delete the e-mail permanently from the database Besides the accomplished success of the presented model, the configurability of both the text mining and prediction processes provide many possibilities of further enhancement of the model, e.g. by adding new variables or enlargement of synonym lists Figure 8.

During the project it also became clear, that a professional e-mail address management can contribute in great terms to the prevention of hardbounces in the future  5. Conclusion  It has been shown that text mining offers new perspectives in e-mail bounce management, enabling the direct marketer to decide independent from ASPs whether an e-mail address has to be excluded from campaigns or not. This was considered necessary due to the inconsistent application of RFC standards in email transport error communication by ISPs which lead to an equivocal classification of e-mail addresses With the presented model using semantic we could develop a process to classify e-mails faster and more precise in terms of the FNR. The main advantage of the model is the consideration of unstructured semantic content through a numeric and structured representation obtained through the singular value decomposition embedded in the text mining process which improves the false-negative classification rate by almost 1% to less than 3%. Having 50,000 bounces in an example campaign of 1,000,000 addresses \(5 bounce rate\within the standard model 2,000 e-mail addresses \(4%\where blocked by mistake, while the new model improves this value by 25% to 1,500 addresses \(3%\ed by mistake. This effect multiplies with the amount of used addresses and campaigns meaning more available addresses for email campaigns. In a simplified example one could say that when holding 10,000,000 e-mail addresses, with 5% bounced and classified, the potential revenue of 5,000 addresses could be recovered At the same time the risk of being blacklisted is reduced due to the faster classification and identification of hardbounces. Moreover, the faster classification allows instant action regarding bad e-mail addresses, proactively trying to recuperate the inherent margins from customers who have given their admission for e-mail marketing campaigns Further research questions regarding this topic can be raised in terms of the interconnection of address management measures and proper prediction of deliverability, application of different prediction models as well as the development of an obligatory standard for error communication in e-mail transportation     References  1 T  D o ld, B  H o f f m a nn, a n d J  N e um a nn Marketingkampagnen effizient managen, Vieweg Wiesbaden, 2004  2 J  Br uns D i re k t m a rke ting  K i e h l, L udw ig s h a f e n 20 07    3 A g nita s, Die P r oz e s sk e tte i m  E-Ma il-Ma rk e ting   http://www.agnitas.de/news/newsletter/newsletter_06_06.htm 2007  4 M.

Basics of the Competing Risks Analysis \(CRA  In competing risks analysis \(CRA experiences multiple risks simultaneously, but it may fail from one of the risks only and fail only once. The risk that leads to the failure becomes the cause of the failure Therefore, risk is often used before the failure occurs and the cause is preserved for the afterwards \(Crowder 2001 failure is the defining characteristic of competing risks analysis. It also implies that the system is multivariate from the perspective of risks, but univariate from the perspective of the single failure time and single cause  There are two sets of formulations for CRA in the literature. The first is described with a pair of vectors of random variables the latent \(theoretical David and Moeschberger 1978 used below well as sub-survival functions \(Crowder 2001  There is one and only one cause in the set of k causes for each failure observed.  The elements of C are called risks before failures and causes afterwards. The risks compete for the cause. In reliability analysis, C might be faulty components in a series system and T is the breakdown time of the system; or C might be the failure modes, such as asymmetric vs. symmetric  The sub-distribution function is defined as   tTjCtjF equivalently, the sub-survivor function is defined as   tTjCtjS &gt Obviously jptjFtjS   where   jSjFjCp j represents the marginal distribution of C

Similarly Pr\(cause j | time t specific age group 9 The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multi-state modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multi-state models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and PHM. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one reference in the form of monograph, i.e., by Hougaard 2000 analysis in the context of reliability and PHM can be found in Ma &amp; Krings \(2008c 2008d frailty and multi-state modeling, respectively. Given the complexity involved with multivariate survival analysis, any description of actual model is quite involved and hard to fit in a comment box. Box 3.3 only contains a few concepts  The previous univariate survival analysis and, to a lesser extent, the competing risks analysis have several significant limitations. The first limitation is the implicit assumption of single failure or single time-to-event transition. In Figure 2 multiple states and multiple transitions are the norm, rather than the exception. This is a multivariate survival system and multi-state modeling is obviously more appropriate than the univariate or competing risks analysis. Competing risks analysis can only address the multiple risks, but not multiple failures, which further can be dependent with each other. In more general terms, multiple failures with common-events modes represent the typical failure mechanisms in a multivariate system, but both univariate survival analysis and competing risks analysis can help little in modeling the dependences This constitutes the second limitation.  A third limitation is that not all covariates are observable, and some of the unobservable or unobserved may have critical influences on the 'survival' \(or transitions between states nodes. These unobservable covariate factors may create common-risks dependences, and the shared frailty model can capture these kinds of unobservable common-risks While the capability to capture the effects of unobserved or unobservable common-risks is critical for reliability modeling, its criticality to survivability modeling cannot be overemphasized because the quantitative study of this issue does not exist in the existing survivability research Therefore, shared frailty modeling is a critical tool for studying the influences of UUUR events in the tactical level modeling of survivability  Of course, the above limitations discussed equally apply to the traditional reliability theory because traditional reliability theory is based on the binary-state logic \(either failed or operational especially of computer networks, is often characterized by 


especially of computer networks, is often characterized by the multi-state performance degradations before reaching the complete failure. This multi-state nature of reliability has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and the most significant advances have been in the field of multistate reliability modeling \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003                                                 4. STRATEGIC MODELING AND DYNAMIC   Box 3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis  Dependence Mechanisms  Dependence is often the central focus of multivariate survival analysis, and together with censoring, they complicate survival analysis most significantly. Hougaard \(2000 three mechanisms of dependence: \(i ii iii Common events are equivalent to common mode failures in reliability analysis, for example, failure events due to accidents or natural disasters. The common risks mechanism describes the scenario that the individuals are dependent due to some common unobserved risks such as common genes in siblings or a bug in the operating system that may affect all software running on 


operating system that may affect all software running on it. The third mechanism, event-related mechanism refers to the phenomena that the actual event itself changes the risk, such as virus infection of a computer node Shared Frailty Modeling  Shared frailty theory occupies the central focus of multivariate survival analysis. The dominance is not accidental because frailty captures crucial but often directly unobservable \(latent random variables, which are attributable for dependence and variations. To some extent, dependence, variation randomness, and frailty all address some facets of multivariate failure events. The frailty theory provides a unique set of approaches to address the theoretical and practical issues related to those four concepts.  Similar to the fact that censoring is the trademark feature of survival analysis \(both univariate and multivariate frailty theory is the trademark of multivariate survival analysis. These two trademark properties, censoringhandling and frailty modeling, have made multivariate survival analysis a unique and indispensable mathematical tool for biomedical and public health research Multi-State Modeling  Multi-state has been developed concurrently in several fields in the last decade, including survival analysis \(Hougaard 2000 reliability \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003 Commenges 1999 Huzurbazar 2006 multi-state modeling has been adopted to solve the domain specific problems, and the flow graph modeling offers a flexible and powerful approach to analyze multi-state models in general. Multi-State model is often formulated as Markov Process models. The transition probabilities in multi-states modeling are well defined by survivor functions \(Hougaard 2000 multi-state model is to estimate the state transition probabilities from hazards functions. multivariate system. According to Lisnianski and Levitin's \(2003 any systems that can have a finite number of performance rates are multi-state systems. Furthermore a system may consists of components which themselves could be multi-state subsystems 10 4. STRATEGIC LEVEL MODELING AND DYNAMIC HYBRID FAULT MODELS  Hybrid fault models are derived from agreement algorithms Lynch 1997 redundancy management in fault tolerance.  Therefore, the choice of hybrid fault models directly affects reliability analysis and fault tolerance. Despite the close ties between reliability and fault tolerance fields, Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e Ma 2008a with regard to the quantitative relationship between reliability analysis and hybrid fault models. To address the unrealistic assumption, they proposed a new concept  dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF mathematical tools \(survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling we first briefly describe the issues involved and summarize some of their key findings in Box 4.1  Agreement algorithms started out with the introduction of the Byzantine general problem by Pease et al. \(1980 Lamport \(1982 system are abstracted as generals of an army.  Loyal generals \(non-faulty components algorithm e.g., to attack or retreat while traitors \(or bad components others by sending conflicting messages. Because the focus of agreement algorithms is to reach agreement in the presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the 


presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models. The following is a summary for the potential benefits of introducing DHF models to reliability and PHM  i

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
