Giuria 1 10125 Torino Italy   Cosmic ray radiography has some advantages over the other radiographic techniques based for examples on X or  rays: no 
radiation sources are requested, this means no hazard for operators or vehicle occupants, moreover cosmic radiation is much more penetrating than X or  rays allowing to inspect big volumes, and finally it provides a three dimensional image of the object made of high Z material. On the contrary the low cosmic rate on the earth is the main disadvantage making the inspection time quit e long  The technique is based on the Multiple Coulomb scattering that the cosmic muons  undergo when passing through matter According to Moli\350re theory, the scattering angle distribution is approximately a Gaussian with zero mean value and a width given by the well known formulae   plane space  2  1

According to \(2\ large scattering angle are mainly due to materials with low radiation length which means hi gh atomic number Z. As an example Table I shows the space  for 3 
GeV muons going through 10 cm thickness of different materials  To measure the scattering angles of cosmic rays crossing the volume under study, the incoming and outgoing muon tracks are meas ured by 2 stations of localizing detectors  To inspect cargo or truck loads in ports or at frontier borders, large area detectors are required with adequate space resolution, in addition the detectors have to satisfy the requirements of robustness, low cos t and simple operation.

      requirements This technique has been investigated at the INFN Technological Laboratory in Torino performing a preliminary test with the RPCs designed for the  muon spectrometer trigger system of the ALICE experiment at LHC  6   and by means of a Monte Carlo simulation   II  D ETECTORS AND E XPERIMENTAL S ETUP  The detectors used for the test were single gap RPCs made of  2 mm thick bakelite electrodes separated by a 2 mm gas gap and equipped with 2 cm wide strips. The RPCs were operated in streamer mode with a humid gas mixture made of  50.5%Ar 41.3%C 2 H 2 F 4 7.2%C 4 H 10 1%SF 6   signals were read out by a front end electronics based on a dual threshold signal discrimination  developed for the ALICE muon spectrometer without any signal amplification  The RPCs detect muons with high efficiency \(> 95%\ and 2 ns time resolution, while the spatial resolution depends on the read out strip width being 5 mm for 2 cm wide strips   The test was performed on the same station where the efficiency of the ALICE RPCs were measured by means of cosmic rays before their installation in ALICE [7  T h e  experimental setup consists of a cosmic ray tracking telescope made of two identical stati ons composed by two RPCs covering an area  of 7 0 327 17 0 cm 2 horizontally placed at     a distance of 35  cm  one above the other. The two stations were located at a distanced of 1.8 m and blocks of different materials were positioned in between \(Fig 1  A t est  was  performed with 3 bricks made of iron, lead and alumin um wit h dimensions quoted in Table II and placed at a distance of 25 cm one from the other; 10 6  events were collected in about nine hours of data taking  A Monte Carlo simulation based on GEAN T3 package was developed taking into account momentum and angular distribution of cosmic ray. The experimental setup was described and the hits on the detectors digitized according to the RPC response   III  D ATA A NALYSIS AND R ESULTS  In the data analysis, for the cosmic ray tracking we required only one cluster per read out plane on the four RPCs to reject cosmic showers. Hits on RPCs were defined by the clusters centers of fired strips. Trajectories of incoming muons were obtained as straight lines going thr ough the hits on the upper RPCs \(RPC1 and RPC2 in Fig.1\, the same for the trajectories of the outgoing muons but through the hits on the lower RPCs RPC3 and RPC4 in Fig. 1   According  to this technique, the identification of an object made of high Z m aterials requires the measurement of the scattering angle of the cosmic muon and the evaluation of the volume where the Coulomb scattering produces large deflection angle because of the presence of high Z material this is obtained assuming that the muon t rack deflection is due to a single scattering event  For each event the angle between the incoming and the outgoing muon tracks was calculated and the scattering point was evaluated by the point of minimum approach of the  extrapolated trajectories. To rej ect wrong trajectory reconstructions, tracks which do not approach less than 5 cm or in which scattering angle is larger than 20 0  are  rejected   Fig.2 shows the measured scattering angle distributions for events with the reconstructed scattering point loca ted inside the blocks made of different materials. It is evident that cosmic rays are highly scattered when passing through the lead block as can be seen from the most important tail of the angle distribution due to lead with respect to the distributions d ue to the other  materials  A selection of tracks with scattering angle larger than 3 0  was performed to put in evidence the high Z object as can be seen in Fig. 3 where the scattering point distribution in the xy plane is shown  The projection along the x axis of the same distribution  after the background subtraction is presented in Fig. 4. The blocks are well identified by the three peaks, whose f.w.h.m. estimates their dimensions: 11.1 cm and 20 cm respectively in the x and   Fig. 1.

  y projections  for the lead block \(central\, lower precision was achieved along the vertical direction   As the number of cosmic rays crossing the three blocks was almost the same, the difference of counts in each peak is due to the different scattering power of the three materials that is to their atomic number Z. Fig. 3 and 4 show the capability of the system to provide a radiographic image of objects made of different Z materials  Besides that, to quickly detect high Z materials, an algorithm was developed based on the fact that  a high Z object produces many highly scattered muons with scattering points within a small volume. The algorithm search for large densities of highly scattered tracks dividing the inspected volume into cubic voxels \(2.5 2.5 2.5 cm 3 for each voxel the nu mber of highly scattered \(3 0  s  20 0 tracks N s  and the total number of tracks N tot  passing  through the same voxel are counted, then the scattering density is calculated as the ratio R i N s  N tot   Fig. 5 shows the scattering density distributions for  cosmic rays scattered by air \(black\, iron \(blue\ and lead \(red\: the three distributions are well separated according to the material atomic number. The high Z materials are detected requiring scattering densities higher than a threshold value. To detect  lead the cut value was set at 0.3, while for other materials it should be optimized by means of simulations and new experimental tests. The result of the algorithm is presented in Fig. 6 where the 3D distributions of scattering points before a\ and after  b\ the scattering density cut are shown  The whole study has been performed analyzing 10 6  events and with small voxels dimensions \(2.5 2.5 2.5 cm 3 the statistical error, due to the tracks number in each voxel, was 3  To use this technique for cargo  or vehicles inspection, it is mandatory to decrease the acquisition time till to few minutes A data analysis has  been performed with larger voxels \(5 5 5 cm 3 and 10 5 events, which corresponds to less than one hour of data acquisition, in order to have a  statistical error of 5  results are shown in Fig.7 where the lead block is still well detected   IV  C ONCLUSIONS  The radiography based on cosmic ray multiple scattering is a technique recently developed which can have a useful application in safeguards me asurements with many advantages with respect to the radiography based on X and  rays. An experimental test to detect blocks made of aluminum, iron and lead was performed using the RPCs designed for the muon spectrometer trigger system of the ALICE experiment. A data analysis algorithm for detecting high Z materials was developed and tested. Results show the capability of the system to detect a lead block in a simple configuration  The performed study shows that RPCs are simple, robust detectors which fulf ill all the requirements for the identification of high Z materials by means of cosmic ray multiple scattering. New tests are foreseen to check more complex experimental conditions and to optimize both detector parameters and data analysis algorithm   Iron Lead Aluminum X cm Y cm Iron Lead Aluminum Iron Lead Aluminum X cm Y cm  Fig. 3.

shown in figure 2 which is captured from EViews are shown in figure 3, it indicates that the AR and MA process weaken to 0 exponentially after the 7th-lag. Lag label 2, 5 and 7 seems relatively significance for both of the processes but the predicted model still needs to be probed  Figure 2. Unit-root test result of the original data   Figure 3. ACF and PACF after 1st difference and 7-days seasonal difference  459  Figure 4. Parameters results of ARMA model  In the end, we have got an ARMA model with seasonal factors consideration that just contributes by  with t equals t-1, t-5 and t-7 for both AR and MA processes, that is  6 The results of parameters are show in figure 4. So according to \(4 5 value on the next day's maximum electrical load is 7 Although the R-squared result has been 96.73%, but the estimated AR process is non-stationary and MA process is non-invertible It is mainly because the available electric series is a bit short when doing the seasonal difference with time space longer the result can be improved. Still the parameters regression shows that the rejection probability of  is larger than the others \(35.63 electric data, the Saturday and Sunday maximum power loads are lower than the working-day especially when the Olympics has began, so there may be still some internal cycle at the working-day which induces the high rejection probability of . We also have tried to make a predicted model only on the working-day series but no more better result to be found until now Also the electric power load shows a trend of gradual decrease, consider that at the end of summer Beijing turns to be rainy, so the temperature may also decrease which implies that there may be some contact between the power and the temp, this will be delivered in the next chapter  3. Enhanced model-with the temperature considered  Although the time series model can embed the unknown factors with the historical information, but still there are many unpredictable processes that are harmful for the model fitness and prediction. Follow this chapter, we introduce the factor-the highest temperature processes which we consider can not be expressed by the model above. We try to add it to the original model as a revise one In summer, the electric consumption is the highest in China, mainly because people always use air conditioner to control the indoor 


temperature, how the weather temperature plays a roll in the electric power load everyday is the main point we considered here. Definitely the highest temp is used here, that can be easily found on the official website of Beijing Meteorological Bureau. Figure 5 shows the highest temperature during the day in this period. Let  be the series of the highest temp 15 20 25 30 35 40 21 26 31 5 10 15 20 25  C Date \(from July to Augest  C  Figure 5.

The production is just like the power consumption, though it used the change of temp, we consider their will be the same form used to supplement the original electric power model. Similarly follow the steps detailed in 2.1, the revised model can be made as 8  8   Figure 6.

The R-squared is lower than the original model, but the AR process is stationary and MA also invertible compared with the model no temp part contained. D-W has been more close to 2, all mean that the new model enhances its generalization ability through the trade-off between the more accurate fitness with training sample and the more adaptive capacity with the future samples  4. Summary and future work  We have described the electric power load during the Olympic time period, given a final time-series illustration and further improvement of the model. The data starts on July 21 and ends on August 24, during which our work was to do the next day's predictions with the time-series analysis. Obviously the models are changed with the new data joining in at the beginning of this work, but become more stable with time flying and finally we have got the models above 


and finally we have got the models above Unit-root test with the identification of ACF and PACF is used to check the stationarity which gives a more secure combinational test. The prediction is relatively satisfied, with high forecast accuracy and low Durbin-Watson stat Then the highest temperature is taken into account for the electric power load as a complement enlightened by the Cobb-Douglas production function. More accuracy and less serial correlation are found. The future work we will be engaged in are the more generalized model to explain, and find out the abnormal in advance, which we think is highly make sense  References  1] Y.H. Jiang, Q.H. Gu, B.H.

IN THE DIFFERENT PERIODS Non-ice snow period Melts to freeze period Vehicle type Conversion factor Vehicle type Conversion factor E1 0.58 E1 0.54 E2?E3?E4 E7?E8?E15 1.00 E2?E3?E7 E15 1.00 E5?E9 2.10 E4?E8 1.29 E10?E12?E6 2.87 E5?E9?E10?E12?E16 1.87 E11 ? E13 ? E14 E16 ? E17 E18 3.98 E6 ? E11 ? E13 E14 ? E17 E18 2.69 From Tab.?, conclusions can be drawn 1216  Conversion factors of motorcycle in these two periods are almost the same. That means motorcycle affects other vehicles in the same way during these two periods  Standard vehicle types included in these two periods are different. There are two more standard vehicle types in non-ice snow period than that in the period of the melts to freeze. That is two small and medium-sized bus or truck \(medium-sized microbus and truck with carrying capacity from 2 to 4 tons the period of the melts to freeze, these two vehicle types has been sorted out as a single class, and the corresponding conversion factor is 1.29, similar to that of station wagon in URTPS  The classification of medium and large-sized vehicles is different in these two periods. In the nonice snow period, according to the conversion factor medium-sized bus and truck \(micro-bus and medium-sized truck with carrying capacity about 5 tons meanwhile in the period of the melts to freeze, these two vehicle types has been classified into the class of medium and large-sized vehicle \(medium-sized microbus with 3 rows, medium-sized truck with capacity about 5 tons, large-sized truck with capacity from 5 to 10 tons, cement blender truck, and medium-sized tank truck of the melts to freeze, the ratio of the driveway time occupancy of medium-sized vehicle is close to the ratio of large-sized vehicle. This also indicates that the speed decrease of medium-sized vehicle is more apparent than that of large-sized vehicle  The classification of oversize truck is basically alike Except large-sized bus, the classification of oversize truck in these two periods is alike. But the conversion factors are quite different, and this indicates that in the period of the melts to freeze oversize vehicles are affected much less than cars As to the speed margin between these two types of vehicles, speed margin in the period of the melts to freeze is smaller than that in the non-ice snow period  The gross value of conversion factors is different Conversion factors of the period of the melts to freeze are less than that of the non-ice snow period This also can be seen in the analysis on the ratio of the driveway time occupancy 


the driveway time occupancy VII. THE APPLICATION OF VEHICLE CONVERSION FACTORS IN DIFFERENT PERIODS IN TRAFFIC PLAN The influence of vehicle conversion factors in different periods to traffic plan is indicated by different PCE traffic flow allocution in the basic year and planning year. From Tab.?, the calculation result of PCE traffic flow, which is based on the vehicle conversion factor in non-ice snow period, is larger than that based on the vehicle conversion factor in the period of the melts to freeze. The value of PCE traffic flow determines the width, section shape, and lane numbers of road in urban traffic plan, therefore, focus should be laid on the proportion of freezing period and non-ice snow period of a year. Taking the method of weight-balancing to decide the yearly vehicle conversion factors of each vehicle type, the PCE traffic flow based on the yearly vehicle conversion factors should be a scientific database for urban traffic plan VIII. CONCLUSION In this paper, a new method of allocution on vehicle conversion factor, which is based on the fuzzy clustering on the ratio of the driveway time occupancy, has been put forward. And according to this new method, vehicles has been divided into different types and vehicle conversion factors calculation has been conducted in accordance with the melts to freeze and non-ice snow periods respectively Difference in the vehicle classification in these two periods has been noticed, and as to the vehicle conversion factors of the same type, the former one is apparently smaller than the latter one. In these two periods, vehicles influence traffic flow differently according to various vehicle classes, and vehicle conversion factors vary due to different vehicle classes. When the mixed traffic flow in these two periods is converted into PCE traffic flow, different vehicle conversion factors should be adopted, calculation should be conducted respectively. Thus, the PCE traffic flow can be used as reliable database during research processes on traffic flow theory REFERENCES 1] [1] Zhangqi-sheng, Zhangya-ping, Analysis on Road Traffic Capacity [M] Beijing: China Communications Press, 2002. 20~33 2] [2] Wang-jin, Tangzhong-hua, Luhua-pu.

Conclusions The SHOTPUT mission , its unique trajectory and potential encounter with six different small bodies will provide a novel view of the composition of the solar system. The science return from the mission will help answer questions on formation, composition and evolution of small bodies in our local neighborhood In addition, the team has proposed a mission that is within budget based on heritage instruments satisfying the decadal survey requirements. The opportunity for spectacular science return on this rare trajectory should not be missed The innovative SHOTPUT mission is truly one of a kind Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Anita Sohus, Amber Norton and JPL Team X for their contributions to this work.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
