Fuzzy is a kind of uncertainty which exists commonly in real world. Zadeh made lots of research on expression and treatment of fuzzy from set theory, his basic principle is: fuzzy concept can be expressed by fuzzy set, and fuzzy set can be expressed by its membership function. But in Pawlakís rough set theory, it expresses a conceptís approximate degree in a known knowledge structure by using up/low approximate operator. When applied successfully, the two theories have shown their some flaw. It may remedy defect to merge each other. So some scholars merged them forming fuzzy rough set. The paper tried to study  the object, too Cluster analysis is an important function in data mining, and clustering algorithm is the core of study. A good clustering algorithm should have expansibility and fast process high dimensions of data, and isnít sensitive to noise, and so on. Many clustering algorithms have been presented and they were divided into four types: divide-based clustering algorithm   density-based one  layer-based one  and grid-based one  The  method of grid-based measured the target space a limited number of units, in which data are regarded as a processed object. The processing time is independent of the number of data objects, and only relate to the number of units in each dimension of measure space. The algorithm in the paper extracts condensation points by the theory of fuzzy rough sets and softens the edge of the dense block by drawing condensation points in the borders, so the property of the algorithm was improved  2  The  fuzzy rough sets  2.1 Fuzzy set foundation and Pawlak rough set  In the universe U, Fuzzy set A can be expressed as A={\(x 002\035 A x\\x 001\031 U}, membership function 002\035 A x U 001  e a n s t h e deg r ee of  x su bordi n a t e t o A  If  A  is a finite set or countable set, then A can be expressed as A 002\010\002\035 A x i x i if A is a uncountable set, then A can be expressed as A 000ú\002\035 A x\x If R is equivalent relation on U, then [u R is equivalent type of object u 001\031 U lies, or object uís neighbor field of  relation R. set cluster U/R={[u R u 001\031 U} is all equivalent types of U 002 A 001\031 P\(U

The distribution of condensation points represents one of the clustering samples. In the Area that the original sample points distributed densely, the condensation points distributed densely. Otherwise, In the Area that the original sample points distributed thin, the condensation points distributed thin. So to extract cluster-centre from sample points set could be changed to extract cluster-centre from condensation points set. That was a sieve program, which discarded the thin units and the noise points, and raised efficiency of the algorithm    This process divide the data space into four part fuzzy grid layer by layer, and the process ends when the gridís density is less than the given value, and the counting in the grid is change to 0. \(to do the count by the count\(\ function\.

Therefore, in order to accurately diagnosis illness state, a variety of possible symptoms must be considered comprehensively and dialectically  Each clinical symptom \(including physical characteristics\ has a dialectical sense. Each of the symptoms for the diagnosis sense of the syndrome is not a simple one-to-one relationship, but a symptom has different diagnostic value to a variety of syndromes the diagnosis of each syndrome often requires a variety of clinical manifestations \(symptoms\ can make a diagnosis. Therefore, we should understand the dialectical meaning of various common symptoms Solve two problems 0017 What are the symptoms for some syndromesí performance  0018 Each symptom of the syndrome, how much is the contribution \(or confidence\umber? And give a quantitative description  Differentiation is mainly to identify the location of disease and pathogenesis at this stage, and its specific content is called as dialectic elements. The location of disease mainly includes heart, brain, lung, spleen, liver kidney, stomach, gall, small intestine, large intestine bladder, uterus, sperm room and so on. The pathogenesis mainly includes wind, cold, wet, dry, fire thermal p u t um breat h st ag n a t i o n  bl ood s t as i s   deficiency of vital energy, blood deficiency, Yin deficiency, Yang deficiency and body fluid deficiency and so on. The more common and more normative clinical disease name generally is composed of the different elements of diseaseí location and pathogenesis, add certain pathology and conjunctions  Questionnaire of tongue diagnosis clinical cases roots in the hospital outpatient data in the case including the age, nationality, marriage, occupation weight, height, lung, spleen, liver, kidney, head, gall intestine, stomach, bladder, cough, and many other fields, but some of the fields do not have great impact on the diagnosis, such as Name, Occupation, Weight Height, and so on, therefore, in clustering analysis get rid of them, and see other fields as the dimension of clustering analysis  When data processing, the parameters of the disease are: if it gets this disease, the item is one, no such disease, it is zero. If the patient gets headache faint\o stomach pain, the data of headache is one and that of stomach is 0   For the dimension of age use the original data in the standardization of minimum to maximum to do linear transformation. Referring to the existing data the min value is 0, the max value is 120, standardize all ages in the span ex a m ple  t h e ag e o f  m i n  is 0, the max value is 120, will be standardized 60 to     0  0  0 0  1  0 120 0 60       v 0.5  Actually using this formula can be directly used the age to divide 120, that is the data after conversion After finishing the patient record form as Table 1

Table 1  Results characterized the vector of symptoms  Considering the close distance and the location of point, also the shape and size of cluster data and other factors, each receives a new data, it is necessary to calculate it in the membership function mapping the value of membership, and in accordance with its 0010  attribution determine the clusterís ownership. If membership values exceeds a given threshold 0010 is that the data belongs to the corresponding cluster, at the same time to amend the statistical information of the cluster  When the point of all membership values has not achieved 0010 record it into the grid information table, as isolated existence. Timing scanning the grid information table, found a spot on the grid cluster concentration more than the minimum concentration requirements, we generate a new cluster, the cluster record in the table, registration relevant statistical information 000\003 According to the Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Group to provide the clinical cases, the paper "of the lung card category" of simulation experiments using VC  6.0 as a development platform, and to establish the network diagnosis model  Choose six of a total of 180 cases of card sample data for clinical samples. Each sample consisted of chest pain, chest tightness, cough, sputum less long have asthma or shortness of breath and other symptoms of information 33. Sample data permit classification as follows: 26 cases of lung cold beam, the cold drink in 30 cases, table 34 cases of cold, heat, heat Obstructing evil pulmonary 30 cases, 28 cases of lung phlegm, 32 cases of lung Yu  For six cards each for 10 cases of data as a training sample of 120 patients with final data for testing First, data on 180 cases were normalized, and the value of all were between 0 cas es of train i ng samples were divided into 28 groups, produce 28 cluster centers, including the threshold 002\025 0.3. It means that the hidden nodes desirable 28  Requirements for the experimental results were divided into six categories, set six output nodes. Output 0,0,0, 1,0,0 0,0,0,0,1,0\ \(0,0,0,0,0,1 were identified that section 1,2,3,4,5, Category 6, so  the construction of network structure is 33-28-6  Procedures use the follow rule for the output of the network: the output node with 6 dimensions chose its maximum value, and then set 1 to it, the other five output set value to 0. Error use 2 1 1  2 N k k E e   000 N is the number of samples. The program settings when error or the number of training was more than 10,000, ended  training, that was the end of the proceedings  Experimental operating results as table 2. When the training times reach to 3486, errors E = 0, procedural convergence, verified 100 samples, and the recognition rate was 99% and operating time for three seconds  The results showed that, after the clustering algorithm embed into the model, it can effectively search for the importation sample data.  The algorithm can quickly cluster data for the high-dimension and big data. Therefore, the algorithm has fast convergence and stronger ability to identify and stronger generalization ability and other characteristics.

The improvement algorithm of g rid clustering based on fuzzy rough set was used in the data processing of the tongue diagnosis of TCM. The algorithm through acceleration the process of clustering tolerated the noise data, so it overcame shortcomings of expensive time-consuming in the traditional fuzzy clustering algorithm, and made the process of enhancing the clustering accuracy and flexibility. In the case of the same number of training samples, its training times reduced, but its recognition rate increased, so that the reasoning of the learning process could quickly and accurately obtain useful information, timely search the database of experience diagnosis.

  6  Figure 1: Lunar Habitat Wi reless Testbed \(foreground at Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX  The core of the new node, referred to in the figure as the main board, manages the data acquisition and processing.  It contains a low-power microcontroller, off-chip expandable memory, and the node\222s power supply. The microcontroller on the main board schedules sampling of the board\222s sensors \(using its own A/D module\he sensed data prior to transmission The main board interfaces with a radio module.  Typically a commercial off-the-shelf \(COTS\ponent, the radio module consists of a second microcontroller, radio circuitry and antenna assembly.  The radio module fully implements the  networking stack for the protocol under investigation and interacts with the main board mainly through transmit and receive commands over a hardware interface \(e.g serial bus With an integrated main board and radio module, the core of a multi-purpose sensor node is complete.  We can then add an application-specific sensor card, containing all the sensors needed from the application under investigation as well as auxiliary hardware such as digital signal processing chips or more advanced A/D components when application requirements exceed the comput ation and signal processing capabilities of the main board\222s microcontroller.  In such a scenario, the microcontroller may be used primarily to schedule the distributed sensing tasks, leaving the bulk of data acquisition and analysis to these more powerful secondary modules The goal of this modular design is twofold.  First, it allows us to build a WSN \223developmen t kit\224 that can quickly be customized to meet new distributed sensing needs for applications research.  Second, it allows us to interchange radio modules implementing different WSN protocol stacks while running the same front-end sensing applications to meaningfully compare the capabilities of different protocols and standard implementations We plan to interface this design with radio modules implementing both the WirelessHART and ISA100.11a stacks, for which COTS components are now coming to market.  Using this platform, we intend to pursue the following lines of investigation 200  RF issues How reliable is the data delivery of these advanced industrial WSN protocols in practice?  How resistant are transmissions to multipath and other RF interference? What are achievable throughput rates? How well does this system co-exist with other 2.4 GHz devices such as wireless LAN 200  Power issues How power-hungry are these protocols in practice? Do they achieve operational lifetimes on the order of years as advertised?  How does the sensing task affect battery lifetimes?  How do scheduled and event-driven sensing differ in their power requirements  200  Application issues How feasible is it to accurately sense high-frequency transient events Can timing information derived from the CDMA MAC be used to accurately synchronize timestamping of measurements across nodes  200  Protocol issues How will future protocols improve upon WirelessHART and ISA100.11a e.g., next-generation ZigBee\  When the market matures, which standard or standards will be best suited to spaceflight applications?  Will modifications of standards be necessary 5  C ONCLUSIONS  Standards-based WSN protoc ols developed for demanding industrial environments hold much promise for aerospace applications.  They have been designed to cope with extremely difficult RF environments to provide highly reliable data delivery and operational liftimes on the order of years using only onboard batteries.  Preliminary research verifies the shortcomings of protocols relying solely on the CSMA-CA MAC of 802.15.4, such as ZigBee, and encourages further investigation into newer protocols with TDMA MAC options, such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a.  Using a modular platform dividing the processing load of sensing and networking between a pair of processors, we intend to fully investigate these protocols from both network and applications research angles

in both sectors Proposition #17: The more information shared the stronger grows the relationship among partners Content Management Even more than in commerce, website content management was found to pose a major challenge in government. Quite a few participants pointed out that government agencies were lacking a sound STRATEGY for the management of content. The experts referred to the growing complexity of public web content along with government?s obligation to make public information publicly and reliably available. Government agencies obviously try to strike a balance between citizens? need for information and the extent of government services to provide that information electronically. Document Life Management, the management of document flows, as well as the proper ARCHIVING of electronic records and removed web content along with previous versions of websites were mentioned repeatedly as major challenges in e-Government content management. Frequently mentioned was also the lack of web content in languages other than English. While web content management in eCommerce was also reported to be a major challenge, it seemingly had a lower degree of complexity and urgency in part because the legal requirements in this area were far less demanding. In e-Commerce, customer profiles and transactions in progress were enabled to trigger the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 presentation of select content, and content was found to lead into certain types of transactions with certain groups of potential customers. On basis of mining transactional data and maintaining very detailed customer profiles eCommerce organizations it was found had developed a HIGH SOPHISTICATION in fine-grained market and customer targeting. Structured transactional data and nonstructured content was reported to be increasingly joined in ways that sophisticated searches had become possible yielding a plethora of relevant information to identify new marketing opportunities. Also, customer relationship management \(CRM customers to keep their profiles updated such that more targeted approaches with pinpoint accuracy could be performed Proposition #18: Content management is more challenging in government than in the private sector due to volume of information and complexity of linked content 4.3 Stakeholders Relations Additional thematic analysis did not yield additional major concepts than previously reached in pilot. This demonstrates that the cluster is reaching a maturity stage in terms of developing a theory. Three areas needing attention appeared in e-Government: i collaboration and iii to E-Commerce, which mainly emphasized DIVERSITY OF STAKEHOLDERS only Governance in E-Government Relations The governance narrative reflected an ongoing concern in the e-Government side regarding management and CONTROL OF GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. This appeared particularly important due to a clear border between elected officials and nominated professional staff. While POLITICAL SWINGS may help projects keep going, they may also require more explanations from the professional levels about the rationale of EGIS projects and the ways to measure their effectiveness [32] The importance of governance was also reflected through emphasizing POWER STRUGGLEs among different stakeholders to achieve their particular interests and the fear of stakeholders from losing control Proposition #19: Stakeholders governance structure 


Proposition #19: Stakeholders governance structure influences ECIS and EGIS design and deliverables Proposition #20: The process of convincing topleadership to support an EGIS project is harder than in private sector Diversity of Stakeholders This ties up nicely to the next narrative, diversity of stakeholders. To achieve a stable and balanced governance structure one needs to balance relationships among different types of stakeholders, elected and nominated officials, political and professional staff, and federal and local stakeholders. This objective becomes even harder when the boundaries of the system are rigidly fixed for a long period, most of the professional staff retains, the needs are vast and the interests are quite different from each other, pulling into different directions 12, 24]. For example, participants reported the fear to partner with ?a too big city?, and to create dependency on their resources and governance structure. Diversity appeared as a critical issue also for the e-Commerce sector due to shaky, temporary and unstable partnership structures. TRANSACTION-DRIVEN PARTNERSHIPS is the main reason for these weak partnership structures. When value of transaction determines the partnership, ad-hoc coalitions appear with different sizes, resources and political power. While partnerships of these sorts help to cover weaknesses of partners, they also make it harder to find a common denominator in shared set of goals Consequently, this increases the fear of partners, that the partnership can be unbundled at any given moment Proposition #21: The structure of alliances in eCommerce is weaker than the structure of alliances in eGovernment Collaboration as a Critical Component of EGovernment Finally COLLABORATION and INVOLVEMENT of stakeholders in the process were regarded as of highest importance in the e-Government sector. Collaboration was a necessity of many governmental entities, due to diversity of stakeholders and the need of scaling resources to better serve citizens. For example, while small cities benefited from array of information systems offered to them by bigger cities, bigger cities benefited from such collaborations by providing a better service to citizens reducing the cost of EGIS and provide a more standardize structure and control of process Proposition #22:  Government stakeholders tend to collaborate on mid-to-long terms while stakeholders in the private sector tend to collaborate on short-to-mid terms 4.4 Citizen/Customer Focus Citizen/Customer Needs CITIZEN/CUSTOMER NEEDS define much of the way processes and deliverables of technologies are designed both in e-Governement and e-Commerce. Nevertheless there is a big difference in the way these needs are being regarded and the reason for understanding them. The pilot highlighted the robust process B2C implements to deliver a product or a service: understand CUSTOMER NEEDS through mechanisms of surveys and TRACKING behavior gathering this information makes it possible for companies to focus on HIGH VALUE CUSTOMERS and to TARGET SEGMENTS OF CUSTOMERS according to personal characteristics; creating TAILORED BRANDS and services to these particular segments of population; finally, since needs are DYNAMIC, companies have to repeat this process. The main goal of the above illustrated process is to target customers according to their needs and lock them in with the service/product these companies suggest Needs serve in B2C as an instrumental good since is they Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


6 are valued because they lead to something else, a bottomline result, while for G2C needs of citizens serve as an intrinsic good, that is they are valued for their own sake In G2C needs evolved around the desire and obligation to serve these, for example through providing MORE SERVICE ON THE WEB, and a ONE STOP SHOP, one locus addressing and serving citizens needs. The technology in this case serves as the instrumental value to reach a better level of service to more people and to enhance consistency of content toward a CITIZEN-CENTRIC APPROACH. A concern raised in this context was that citizens are unaware that eGovernment services exist or consider them not to be on a high-level standard like the ones belong to the private sector Proposition #23: In both the private and public sectors designing information systems is highly influenced by customer needs, or citizens? needs respectively Proposition #24: Targeting customers via identifying individuals or groups is more sophisticated and frequent in e-Commerce than targeting citizens in e-Government Creating a Strong Customer Experience The other side of the coin of revealing the customer needs in B2C is creating these needs through shaping the CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. While traditionally marketing were the one mainly interested in the customer experience perspective, recently other departments including R&amp;D joined in shaping and creating this experience. Companies understand that the experience determines much of the transaction or future activities of customers. Experience is a complex concept and companies try to reduce uncertain part from their point of view, the part that they cannot influence in the customer experience. Some aspects might be controllable by the companies, e.g. creating a SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, enhancing an EASY and CUSTOMIZED online experience, and partially learning how to work with customer EMOTIONS effectively through the technology. There are some aspects that can be analyzed but less transformative, for example the CORE VALUES a customer assigns to an experience. An important note is that this issue was not found and raised in the eGovernment focus groups discussions Proposition #25: Creating and understanding a customer experience is more likely to be found in eCommerce than creating and understanding a citizen experience in e-Government Proposition #26: The higher the enhancement of the social environment of the customer, the more likely it is that the experience will be stronger Citizen Participation Understanding needs and evolving experience is a different matter than involving the customers in the process of developing a product or a service. Involving customers is reported to be prevalent in Web 2.0 applications [7, 37] but according to our findings, which involved other B2C interactions, it was totally ignored On the other hand e-Government assigns citizen participation in the process a high weight and importance Nevertheless, they make sure that the border between participation and control is not blurred. In other words G2C encourages PARTICIPATION in the decision making but not shifting the decision to the citizens Proposition #27:  Participation of citizens in G2C processes and in the design of EGIS is higher than participation of customers in B2C and ECIS, respectively 4.5 Digital Divide/s Similarly to first pilot conducted, we found that the cluster of digital divide was very minor to non-existent in terms of weight it was given by e-Commerce focus group while it served a big portion of the attention in their counterparts from the e-Government sector. The public 


sector is well aware to this issue and defines it through levels, first and second levels digital divide/s [3]. The first level of digital divide/s focuses on lack of infrastructure private and public and more generally it deals with ACCESS from a technological point of view. The secondlevel of digital divide/s refers mainly to the usage level From the users/citizen point of view it includes the lack of SKILLS or AWARENESS as to how to use information communications technologies effectively and efficiently From the government point of view it focuses on how to make content ACCESSIBLE \(e.g., content that would be accessible by people with disabilities challenge of accessibility from a LANGUAGE perspective that is not yet implemented. The pilot manifested that eGovernment is more focused on the second-level of digital divide/s, that is more on the content, than the traditional one E-Commerce marginalizes and neglects the concept of digital divide/s. It is of less importance to this sector since the drivers are transactions. For example localization of content will occur if a market exists and there is a demand from consumers. The concept itself implies a certain criterion of social responsibility, which contemporarily many companies like to brag about. This pilot demonstrates that words are nice but they are not applied necessarily in the interactions of companies and consumers. It emphasized differences in justifications to the existence of e-commerce vs. e-Government entities business and economic sustainability vs. service and executing policy. Digital divide/s is a ?nice to have concept to e-Commerce and is a top-priority challenge to e-Government Proposition #28: Addressing the challenges of the digital divide/s is more likely to be found in eGovernment than in e-Commerce Proposition #29: Addressing second-level digital divide/s takes more attention in EGIS projects than firstlevel digital divide/s 4.6 Discussion and Summary We set out to investigate, identify, and characterize the similarities and differences between e-Commerce and Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 e-Government since we believed that the findings from such a study would benefit academic knowledge and eCommerce and e-Government practice alike. In the following we discuss and summarize our observations and insights Similarities between e-Commerce and e-Government research question #1 According to our findings both ECIS and EGIS benefit their respective organizations significantly more when the underlying workflows and processes are not only electronic re-embodiments of their paper-based antecedents but rather streamlined, simplified, or completely discarded and replaced by different workflows and processes, which take full advantage of the technology. This seems to be increasingly understood in both commerce and government. We also found completely new workflows in both sectors, which would not have been possible without ECIS and EGIS A great incentive for streamlining and redesigning workflows and processes we found in the increased degree of collaboration within and between the sectors which has become possible in an instantaneous fashion through ECIS and EGIS We further found that collaboration between partners within and across sectors works better when it unfolds on the basis of formal agreements. In government, it was noted that imposed collaboration works poorly as opposed to collaborative engagements based on freedom of choice Interestingly, cross-sector collaboration based on 


Interestingly, cross-sector collaboration based on ECIS/EGIS reduces cost and speeds up the process on both ends even if the private-sector partner provides systems, infrastructure, and maintenance Along with transactional collaboration and integration we found increasing collaboration within and across sectors also in the area of information sharing. If collaboration thrives, we saw even the partial alignment of strategic objectives as a result. Information quality played a critical role in this context. A positive feedback between perceived IQ, information sharing, and the strength of the relationship seemed to exist We found in both sectors that similar governance structures of organizations influenced how collaborative ECIS and EGIS were designed. Remarkably, in both sectors the perceived needs of citizens \(and customers respectively sytems. In e-Commerce, organizations were interested in providing a social environment, which was conducive to a positive experience as a customer These findings suggest that ECIS/EGIS-related phenomena have important characteristics in common which go beyond the mere technical resemblance of systems and methods. Process redesign practices might be a worthwhile subject of further study. Likewise, practices and principles of organizational and technical collaboration appear to provide valuable experiences to be shared Differences between e-Commerce and e-Government research question #2 However, we also found formidable differences in practices, principles, and drivers between e-Commerce and e-Government Transaction processing was found more sophisticated and of far higher volume in commerce than in government. On the other hand, information processing and management, including the archiving of electronic records we found much more developed in the public sector than with private firms. The drivers of innovation were stronger in e-Commerce than in a e-Government however, the overall sophistication of EGIS did not appear to lag behind ECIS by orders of magnitude. Yet private sector firms were found to make far more elaborate use of historical data and data in processing in order to optimize desired organizational outcomes than government agencies. Lower information quality was also found to lead to more immediate and economically more negative effects in e-Commerce than in e-Government Still, governments struggled more than commercial organizations to maintain acceptable levels of information quality leading to far greater challenges, for example, in content management Interestingly, leadership in government appeared to be more supportive of \(in particular, collaborative projects than their commercial counterparts. It also appeared that collaborative structures in the public sector were markedly stronger than those in the private sector Although many EGIS initiatives seemingly greatly cared about citizens? involvement and participation, we found that private firms had an edge in creating a customer experience.? Almost in contradiction to this finding, we noticed that citizens were far more influential in the design of EGIS than customers were in the design of ECIS. At this point, we refrain from speculative explanations for the lack of a sufficiently large base of data Overall, what we found different between eCommerce and e-Government suggests that the two phenomena follow different trajectories despite many similarities and technical commonalities. One obvious explanation lies in the sector-specific differences, which produce different drivers also in this area. It will be 


produce different drivers also in this area. It will be interesting to analyze to what extent Enterprise  Resource Planning \(ERP introduced in government, may help align the trajectories between e-Commerce and e-Government to a higher degree than we found in this study Surprise Findings The process of involving diverse participants and the rich data that evolved from the focus groups illuminated few important phenomena, which need to be discussed One strident finding is the absence of discussion or reference to the issue of ethics both in the e-Government and e-Commerce focus groups. A whole array of clusters Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 emerging from the discussions \(e.g., information management and digital divide not raise any challenges or concerns related to normative decisions of right and wrong. The prevalence of information technologies and usage involves many questions of ethics. Managers gathering and analyzing personal and sensitive information on customers government officials deciding to implement information systems according to political constraints, and accuracy and level of information quality provided to customers and citizens are few examples of the inter-linkage between ethics and e-Government and e-Commerce Striping decisions and strategy from a system of values and norms may be more easy and beneficial in the short horizon, but in the long run may cause inherent difficulties in managing e-government or e-commerce initiatives Another problematic phenomenon we found is the disregard of issues of digital divide/s by the private sector The public sector makes many efforts to understand and address needs of diverse groups in society. EGIS hels the public sector to reach growing portions of the population more efficiently and effectively, through for example providing information in different languages or making information more accessible to populations with disabilities. The private sector, on the other hand, may address indirectly issues of digital divide/s, including issues of access and usage, but only if economic profitability is attached to these needs. Digital divide/s was not raised in the private sector as a concept, because it is not addressed directly, but as a by-product of other initiatives Limitations and future research In our samples of participants from the two sectors we found after the focus groups were conducted that eGovernment experts on average were from higher levels in the organizational hierarchy than e-Commerce practitioners who were more technically oriented and versed. Our results, hence, may be skewed that they represent more strategic perspectives in e-Government and more operational/tactical perspectives in eCommerce We also recognize that what we present here is the result of an exploratory study based on a limited number of participants. Our study attempts to lay theoretical foundations for more quantitatively oriented research on the subject, which will lead us to more generalizable results. We plan to use the twenty-nine propositions developed here in a successive study aimed at closing that gap 5.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
