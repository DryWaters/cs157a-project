Anomaly Detection In Cellular Network Data Using Big Data Analytics Ilyas Alper Karatepe Engin Zeydan Abstract  Anomaly detection is a key component in which perturbations from a normal behavior suggests a misconìgured/mismatched data in related systems In this paper we present a call detail record based anomaly detection method CADM that analyzes the usersês calling activities and detects the abnormal behavior of user movements in a real cellular network CADM is capable of detecting the location of the site that an anomaly has occurred We evaluate the proposed CADM by performing experiments over the call-detail records of AVEA a mobile service provider in Turkey Index Terms  anomaly detection big data cellular networks network management Hadoop I I NTRODUCTION Mobile Service Providers MSPs are forced to process huge amounts of user generated call records sms voice data etc on a daily basis Analyzing this big data can help in solving some of the most common problems in MSPs In addition mobile operator services are diverse and have been offered with a multiple number of functionalities but the current service structure faces several challenges rst of all the possibility of failure/error prone manual conìgurations and management to deliver new networking services e.g wide area network-intensive applications such as video pictures etc presents a constant challenge for mobile operators as well as service providers particularly in areas where correctness of the supplied information is critical e.g billing and charging policy and regulation requirements etc Every new roll-out and deployments in a mobile operator infrastructure introduces new modiìcations on every system and each related entity both operational and planning departments  should adapt into that These frequent changes in a cellular network environment sometimes lead to transient states caused by the network having to manage all changes from multiple components in IT departments resulting in misconìguration and instability Second the deployment life-cycle of new changes in an enterprise network can be long During long lifecycle operations an excessive time is wasted in order to settle for an undisrupted service delivery after addition of each new functionalities into their services Moreover the problem does not necessarily decrease with each additional collection of devices This requires MSPs to either redesign their enterprise architecture for each changes that occur or to limit their services to a lower level Third the forecasting and planning of additional services can be imperfect hence the location timing and severity of I A Karatepe and E Zeydan are with AveaLabs at AVEA  Iletis im Hizmetleri A.S   Istanbul Turkey e-mail alper.karatepe@avea.com.tr engin.zeydan@avea.com.tr aws are sometimes very difìcult to predict Several times MSPs are faced with the challenges of not being able to diagnose the solution to a problem that may occur Answering simple questions such as What are the misconìgured attributes or What is the frequency of anomalous activities in a mobile operator network is particulary difìcult today and remains a very challenging issue Forth major problem that many network/IT system administrators face is the problem of detecting a defect in user activity from a pool with many users with millions of transactions In large datasets there occurs small percentage of anomalies which may be common and difìcult to observe This anomaly may indicate a bad data a random variation or of utmost interest for operation In all cases additional actions should be required One solution to these network/IT management problems is to apply knowledge based anomaly detection methods and set rule policies depending on network behavior In this paper we present one variant of knowledge based technique a rule-based technique for detecting network anomalies for users traveling from one city to another The method is robust and exible for detecting anomalies which may also be adjusted based on the needs of the operations The contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows  A novel approach for anomaly detection by analyzing call-detail records attributes in combination with recent big data analytical tools Hadoop HDFS Map-Reduce Hive etc This approach reduces the cost of data processing compared to traditional data warehouse approaches since big data analytics provides computational ease which is provided by cloud services Moreover keeping and processing the data in conventional enterprise systems may be expensive depending on the licence agreements between the operator and database providers  The method is based on knowledge or rule based approach rather than signatures and patterns that need training data sets to detect any type of anomaly that falls out of normal activity  Reduced IT service lifecycle for error/misconìguration detection The proposed approach can easily discover anomalies especially that occur during roll-out or change periods in a reasonably short period of time compared to traditional long IT service lifecycle A Related Work Anomaly or outlier detection is the method of searching for data items that do not match in an expected behavior or a pattern in a given data set They often provide critical and European Wireless 2014 81 ISBN 978-3-8007-3621-8 VDE VERLAG GMBH,

actionable information There are many extensive surveys of anomaly detection techniques developed in several domains of machine learning and statistics e.g see 2 and reference therein Network anomaly detection methods in the literature can be classiìed into ve categories i Statistical-based ii Classiìcation-based iii Clustering and Outlier-based iv Soft computing-based v Knowledge-based Statistical methods based anomaly detection methods are used with applying statistical models for anomaly detection which can be categorized based on parametric and nonparametric techniques This is the approach that has been followed by 4 Statistical approaches ha v e the adv antage of requiring no previous knowledge and reporting abrupt changes after a long monitoring time However they have some drawbacks such as long training period for statistical inferences and difìcult task of adjusting or tuning different parameters There are several classiìcation-based methods such as knearest neighbor support vector machines and decision trees that have been applied to network anomaly detection problem 6 7 Classiìcation-based techniques are based on categorization of new observations into different classes depending on the relevant model that was constructed based on the training data set Although classiìcation-based techniques are popular due to their considerable exibility and high detection rates they require relevant training information and is highly dependent on assumptions of the classiìers Another anomaly detection technique is to use both clustering and outlier detection techniques Clustering techniques such as kmeans hierarchical clustering and single-link clustering are also frequently used in anomaly detection 9 Although clustering has some advantages such as reducing computational complexity for large data sets stable performance compared to statistical methods it also has some drawbacks such as time consuming dynamic updates and inappropriate proximity measures that may lead into lower detection rates In contrast outlier based detection methods are useful for detecting bursty and isolated events but they also suffer from high parameter dependencies Soft computing-based anomaly detection methods and systems such as genetic algorithms artiìcial neural network approaches and fuzzy set approaches 11 12 ha v e the advantage of learning without any feedback from the environment and adaptability On the other hand scalability and over-ìtting may be some of the disadvantages of these methods Knowledge-based anomaly detection methods such as rule-based ontology-based and logic-based are checking against the predeìned rules or patterns in order to detect anomalies Rule-based and expert system approaches are the most widely used knowledge-based methods Based on the knowledge base matching rules against the current state of the system ensures anomaly detection in the system Some of the approaches are processing rules on packet level signatures e.g Adaboost and Snort 14 an e xpert system that makes a decision that is reasonable to a common human sense Another technique called prudence ensures that when a new value that is outside the range of recorded list is monitored by the system the expert system raises a warning Although all the network anomaly-detection techniques mentioned above have their own strengths and weaknesses due to the nature of our problem we are using a rulebased approach in this paper One of the advantages of using this approach is that the knowledge-based techniques are robust and exible which may be adjusted based on the needs of the operations Moreover the detection rate is high compared to other methodologies such as statistical or unsupervised learning based methods e.g clustering based methods where expanding the anomaly detection methods with may give different results than expected The problem that we are investigating in this paper is related to traveling of a user from one location to another in a physically impossible time duration There may be two reasons for this anomaly misconìguration of location information from the network side or the incorrect mappings of related location attributes in IT systems especially in mediation section This paper is organized as follows Section II provides system model for Call Detail Record a.k.a Call Data Record CDR

for cost effective computation to detect network anomalies by using the proposed CDR based anomaly detection method CADM Among the available big data platforms Hadoop which allows the distributed processing of big amount of data sets across clusters of computers stands out as the most notable one as it is an open source solution Its main components include MapReduce HDFS Hadoop Distributed

a call LAC ID represents the location area code information CITY ID represents userês city-ID information CALL DATE represents userês call date as year month and day CALL TIME represents userês call time and CDR TY PE represents call detail record type e.g sms voice and data These attributes are call-activity related measures that are used to construct the anomaly detection method Basically the

e.g voice sms or data in a given location the system records the t i the time when the i th call happened i.e CALL DATE and CALL TIME pairs and L i the location where the i th call happened i.e LAC ID and CELL ID pairs In Fig 1 the mediation rst collects the CDR data via ftp from network nodes such as GGSN SGSN PCEF etc Then it distributes the collected CDR data via ftp into relevant departments such as datawarehouse billing and charging departments etc for a wide range of purposes During this process mediation obtains CITY ID of the location from LAC ID for each i by an internal query and adds CITY ID as an additional attribute to each i before distribution of CDR to relevant departments We also deìne l i as the location where the i th call happened i.e CITY ID and CELL ID pairs The above measures can be deìned as attributes to anomaly detection method Note also that during CDR generation process managing the same conìguration during the service lifecycle can be complex and error-prone due to involvement of multiple heterogeneous components and different mappings with different systems In Fig 1 CADM collects the processed data from one of the relevant department such as datawarehouse in this example and runs the proposed method on this data Then the detected anomaly output of CADM is feedbacked into mediation department for taking necessary actions The proposed architecture paves the way for a exible and robust way of anomaly detection for mobile operators by better coordinating their conìgurations throughout the service lifecycle to meet their policy level needs Moreover the anomaly detections are implemented by big data analytics and rule based approaches in CADM which will be detailed in next section III CDR BASED A NOMALY D ETECTION M ETHOD CADM In this section we present our anomaly detection scheme based on userês call-detail record CDR activities that is collected in a big data platform The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to detect suspicious CITY ID and CELL ID pairs which are anomalies by monitoring the userês call detail activities The categorization is either normal or anomalous A user j s city-arrival time  a j t k  and city-departure time  d j t k  for a given city k can be identiìed from the collected data The advantage of using city-arrival and city-departure times is that they can easily be obtained with the help of existing CDR attributes t i and l i  This approach can be used to characterize the calling activities of each user Based on the above considerations we deìne R j   P 1 P 2 P 3   P N  as the sequence of traveled cities by a user j  Hence any route of a user can be represented as a sequence of N elements that depends on the number of traveled distinct cities In R j  we determine a quintuple deìnition to represent the travel activities of a mobile user j for a speciìc city k  P k  ID j  l k  a j t k   l k  d j t k   a j t k  d j t k  where ID j is the MSISDN of user j  l k  a j t k  and l k  d j t k  deìne the  CITY ID  CELL ID  pairs for arrival and departure location time information respectively For instance for a four hops route i.e N 4  the route R j can be represented as R j   P 1 P 2 P 3 P 4        012 015\015\015\012 012 015 015  012\015    012 015 012\015  015\015    012    015         Fig 1 CDR generation in a cellular network architecture and the proposed anomaly detection method Deìnition of these attributes simpliìes the tracking of users inter-city traveling activities  Let TD represents the inter-city travel duration that a user has taken between P k and P k 1 in his traveling route R j  The k th TD is deìned as TD k  a j t k 1  d j t k    Let CD k represents the average distance between cities of l k and l k 1   Let TV represents the inter-city travel velocity that a user has taken between P k and P k 1 in his traveling route R j  TV is deìned as TV k  CD k T D k  Let MPTV k represents maximum possible travel velocity between two consecutive cities l k and l k 1 in a given route R j Algorithm 1 is the pseudo code of the proposed CDR based Anomaly Detection Method CADM originated from a rulebased approach which is used to detect anomalous CITY ID  CELL ID pairs through the TV measurements The rst step in CADM is to extract the relevant attributes that can be used Note that relevant attributes should be selected that can reîect the exact activities of a user In CADM attributes such as MSISDN  CITY ID  LAC ID  CELL ID  CALL DATE  CALL TIME  CDR TY PE are extracted to form the CDR AN ALY SIS T ABLE that reîects userês CDR activities We eliminated the non-traveling users i.e users where R j  P 1  during the analysis duration and obtained a total of M traveling users This helps in decreasing the analysis space hence the computational overhead of the system Note also that during this step we exploit distributed European Wireless 2014 83 ISBN 978-3-8007-3621-8 VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany 


processing framework provided by map-reduce which has advantage on computational overhead compared to non-Hadoop solutions Then we formulate the problem as a knowledge based anomaly detection problem In step 2 of the algorithm 1 a rule-based technique is proposed to ag anomalous activities of users traveling between two different cities by calculating the travel velocities and comparing this velocity with MPTV k  We use the following example to show how rule based approach is applied in the proposed CADM Anomalies resulting from misconìgurations may cause deviations in userês tracks By the usage of MPTV one can ascertain how reasonable the calculated TV is for a given route R j  Suppose v 1  500 km/h and v 2  1500 km/h are TVs between two given locations  P 1  P 2 and P 2  P 3 n R j   P 1 P 2 P 3  respectively and 1000 km/h is selected as MPTV for both of travels We could then decide whether there exists any anomaly by just comparing these two velocities with MPTV which implies the existence of an anomaly for v 2 for the given  P 2  P 3  travel Hence for each route of j th user if a TV exceeds a reasonable travel velocity MPTV we can use this jump information to extract the anomalous  P k  P k 1  whereby the CITY ID s labeling of one of them is misconìgured in the system Then this table is stored in a relational database such as MySQL Note that at this step one of the stored  P m  where m  k k 1 is anomalous for each  P k  P k 1  pair Based on this another SQL query is run at the last step of Algorithm 1 in order to obtain the most probable anomalous  CITY ID  CELL ID  pairs Finally CADM results can be sent into the relevant departments for taking necessary actions IV E XPERIMENTAL VALIDATION The CDR records were gathered for an AN ALY SIS  DURAT ION 10 days during a holiday season in October 2013 where the amount of travels in Turkey are at its peak levels during the year Moreover during this period there was routine new roll-outs and deployments in IT/Network systems The cumulative data is taken from the datawarehouse in the form of CDRs with total of 3800 million of rows each row representing a certain call transaction voice and sms of a certain user In our analysis we have ignored CDR TY PE  GP RS related CDRs and foreign MSISDNs We selected MPTV  1000 km/h for all travels which is faster than any transportation vehicle nowadays In our analysis we excluded all anomalous jumps between neighboring cities due to usage of average distance deìnition CD  Our Hadoop cluster used in this experiment consists of 5 nodes with four slaves and one master In our analysis 162  506 of 19  717  327 city changes which corresponds to  0.824 are detected as anomalous travel Table I shows the top anomalous  CITY ID  CELL ID  pairs with their corresponding percentages among all anomaly occurrences in the collected data over the course of the observed day interval According to results in Table I necessary conìguration checks and required xes are done by network and mediation system operator Algorithm 1 CDR based Anomaly Detection Method CADM Inputs AN ALY SIS DURAT ION  The duration of the observed time interval for analysis CDR  Call Detail Record  All calling activities of all users stored in operatorês database for a certain time duration Outputs List of anomalous CELL ID and CITY ID pair records Method 1 Obtain the relevant attributes from call detail records stored in HDFS The attributes are MSISDN  CELL ID  CITY ID  CALL DATE  CALL TIME  CDR TY PE  Include users only who have done call record activities in at least two distinct CITY IDs during AN ALY SIS DURAT ION  Group the records by MSISDN and sort them by CALL DATE  CALL TIME  then store the result in CDR AN ALY SIS TABLE  2 for all j 1,....,M do Obtain the route R j for each user j in CDR AN ALY SIS TABLE where R j   P 1 P 2 P 3   P N  and P k   ID j l k  a j t k  l k  d j t k  a j t k d j t k  by traversing over each row record of CDR AN ALY SIS TABLE  Note that the condition for adding a new P k into R j is the change of CITY ID between two sequential records for all k 2,....,N do If TV k  1  MPTV k  1  then ag the l k  1 and l k pair of P k  1 and P k as anomaly and store the output in CDR AN OM ALY TABLE in a relational database such as MySQL end for 3 end for 4 Execute a query on CDR ANOMALY TABLE that nds and outputs the number of anomalous CITY ID and CELL ID pairs CITY ID CELL ID percentage 101 773 4.5721 126 1932 3.7216 115 19074 3.1195 104 59287 3.0691 106 105 2.9841 101 13521 2.5643 116 12381 2.4350 115 28116 2.3799 143 42632 2.0567 116 12386 2.0159    TABLE I T OP ANOMALY CITY ID AND CELL ID PAIRS WITH THEIR CORRESPONDING PERCENTAGES AMONG ALL ANOMALY OCCURRENCES European Wireless 2014 84 ISBN 978-3-8007-3621-8 VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany

 Fig. 9.  Dynamic Fair Division of Resources  Using the Shapley values, for example, the demand vector for the blue \(Desertification\ mission is 0.34. Since blue also has the largest Shapley value, blue gets first priority tasking allocations. The next playerís turn is determined by the Shapley value and so forth. In our example, Flood mission receives sensor assets since it has the next highest value of 0.21. The cycle continues as missions are complete and assets are freed. The procedure allows for envy freeness. An agent can demand a sensor from another agent as long as it is not allocated or tasked yet Since the Hurricane mission has a higher Nash value for an optical sensor than Flood \(0.04\t takes priority in order to allow for a feedback loop for real world events. Therefore Flood relinquishes its priority for the optical sensor although it had a higher overall average Shapley value. Figure 9 shows the updated water fill queuing diagram. The incorporation of joint Shapley values with Nash values comes into play when the agent requests multiple sensor modalities as requirements When this occurs and there is a possible envy situation, the joint Shapley and Nash values are needed VI  N-P ERSON P RISONER  S D ILEMMA G AME  Cooperation is less likely to emerge in a large group than a small group [16  T h e va l u e o f o n e se ve nt h d ue t o ha vi ng  seven missions in our example\hown in Fig 9 for Landsat 15 are only true if all of the resources on disk are shared. Since our example has seven missions, each mission can ideally have access to all data provided that the images needed to accomplish the mission are available in an existing database Otherwise the information may not be available and needs to be collected. This may result in some other important area of interest not being collected The iterated Prisonerís Dilemma \(PD\ame has been used extensively in the study of cooperative behaviors in social and biological systems. The N player PD game is realistic for modeling the cooperation strategies Each player has two choices between group cooperation or non-sharing defection. Cooperation may also be thought of as free trade versus protectionism It is important to recognize inconsistencies between individual rationality and group rationality. Game theory explains such inconsistencies clearly and simply, which is why it is widely used in various fields of social sciences. The ìprisonerís dilemmaî model represents inconsistencies simply. Hierarchy or multi-level games interact with each other so that each game affects a player at higher or lower levels. Each level of interaction is a strategic game [10 A t each le v e l o n e o p tio n is to ru n th e N a sh  equilibria to determine optimal strategy However, in the real world, individual rational actions are not always taken. In our example, responsible organizations are given incentives to cooperate so that their action can take a better action in the international game so that the blue player can best comp  Unfortunately, it has been shown both theoretically and in the real world that certain strategies that work well for individuals in the PD model fail in large groups. The nonsharing option is dominant for each player, even though it is preferable to choose to cooperate [1 H i s i m port a n t  because it predicts the effect of group size which is not predicted by the Nash equilibrium Results of an open competition are well explained  by CH In many games it boils down to predicting how deeply  other agents in the game will be reasoning. An agent  that does not reason enough risks being exploited by its  opponents, while an agent that reasons too much may  not be able to interact productively with its opponents  In our example, it is more beneficial for all responsible organizations associated with Landsat to share data. We can model the situation as a measure of cooperation \(MOC   a = [1 + [N c  2n 3 ax\(1 + [N c  2n 3  7   In this equation, N c is the number of cooperative decisions made out of N possible decisions. The total number of players is n. This equation generates reward values. In our example we can convert this to a percentage of cooperation and relate it to the amount of Landsat data that can be used for change detection purposes, for example. A lower cooperation level will result in the Landsat 8 sensor needing more tasking or simply failure to accomplish the mission since a historic database is necessary for many applications If one of the playerís representing a responsible organization receives cooperation from another responsible organization, this results in a higher overall value for the blue player and allows for better international competitiveness This level of cooperation in the hierarchy of responsible organizations is very important and can be modeled using equation \(7\his value affects the blue playerís effectiveness as well as lower level hierarchies such as repeating missions and using assets at the expense of other tasking. Yao et al showed that for a four player prisonerís dilemma with a history of two decisions, a 95 percent cooperation level occurs 80 percent of the time Over a long period of time with many players, each with different strategies, greedy strategies tend to do very poorly in the long run while more cooperating strategies do better, as  2014 IEEE International Inter-Disciplinary Conference on Cognitive Methods in Situation Awareness and Decision Support \(CogSIMA  255 


judged purely by self-interest. When the opponent defects, on the next decision, the player sometimes cooperates anyway The successful strategy must not be a blind optimist. It must sometimes retaliate. Though players will retaliate, they will once again fall back to cooperating if the opponent does not continue to defect. This stops long runs of revenge and counter-revenge. The last quality is being non-envious, that is not striving to score more than opponent  We can model our CH example using a powerful tool called analytic hierarchy process \(AHP\HP can be used to make decisions in situations involving multiple objectives. The AHP method uses a weight with each attribute. A higher weight indicates a more important objectiv A n e x tens ion o f t h e Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility can be used to make decision under uncertainty where more than one attribute affects blueís preference and attitude toward risk. In order for blue to check on the consistency of the CH model, we show our example with a consistency check. We present an example using multiattribute utility function in order to show the repeatability of hierarchy level function to create consistent products most useful for the blue player where each attribute is not mutually independent but rather depends on the other We compute the consistency index \(CI\ follows  CI      n n1  8   where A T is a matrix based on the blue playerís levels of hierarchy as discussed in this paper. The values in the A matrix and the weights in the w vector are based on bands missions, assets, and organizations using Shapley, Nash, DFD and the MOC respectively. CI can be used to monitor which three band combinations are used for a given mission such that the consistency of mapping products are monitored For a perfectly consistent decision maker, CI will be equal to zero. If CI is sufficiently small, the decision makerís comparisons are probably consistent enough to give useful estimates of the weights. In our example, if the value of CI is too large, then the blue player can make some adjustments amongst the responsible organizations in order to improve competitiveness on an international level. The goal of the blue player is to manage bandwidth at the lowest level, create the most consistent products using the most efficient missions while ensuring the lower level responsible organizations are cooperating effectively VII  C ONCLUSION  Our approach is to add computational intelligence to provide the analyst with a decision making capability to reduce time to collect and process data while retaining the information needed to complete the mission analysis Since asset tasking has dynamic, discrete, strong opposition and hierarchical traits, decision making becomes more and more complex. It is difficult to analyze and resolve. In the presence of game theory and hierarchical theory, and on the basis of dynamic state attrition-models, our strategy can solve this kind of problem favorably We discussed a method for modeling asset management with limited resources for multiple sensor modality requirements. One solution is to run the Shapley and Nash algorithms for each successive tasking request and then run a dynamic fair division algorithm to ensure that each request is fair with respect to limited available assets. The motivation for fairness is used to ensure that not all sensor assets are dominated by one agent or player \(region of interest\his is needed in order to avoid missing sensing of important events that are occurring around the world. We realize that the solution presented is only a guide and is not intended to replace the human brain in decision making. We offer a user assisted means of prioritization to make agent and resources more effective We used the NPD to model group behavior and cooperation. We provided a real world application to present a framework for bandwidth management of remotely sensed data. This may be useful for generating semi-autonomous decision making tools to the analyst in order to increase the effectiveness of limited resources R EFERENCES  1  A x el r o d, R. a n d H a m i l t o n  W  D T h e e v o l utio n o f co o p e r at io n.

one is more secure than the other. Regardless of the size of the footprint or th e type of architecture, wellwritten and tested kernel code will provide better security. At best, it could be said that they meet different, competing objectives. Microkernel designs have minimal kernels and offer highly customizable management planes. They allow for tailored solutions and simplify the development process Monolithic architectures are preconfigured with necessary drivers and software in the trusted zone They require less domain knowledge to set up and provide fewer options for tampering This analysis will pr ove valuable to both IT professionals and softwa re engineers. Enterprise architects and information security professionals are often forced to make acquisition decisions will less than complete information. This research identified a number of factors to consider before implementing new technologies. However, the present study should not be considered comprehensive. Other design factors should be elicited in future research. This study should also be of interest to software engineers. Often security is considered late in the software development cycle. By analyzing security implications at the architectural level, this research attempts to incorporate security concerns earlier in the design process. Future studies should focus on approaches to compensating for security weaknesses in each type of architecture

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
