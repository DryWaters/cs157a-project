Joint Channel Allocation and User Association for Heterogeneous Wireless Cellular Networks Dariush Fooladivanda Ashraf Al Daoud and Catherine Rosenberg Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Waterloo Canada Email f dfooladi aaldaoud cath g ecemail.uwaterloo.ca Abstract 227We study the engineering of heterogeneous cellular networks composed of a macrocell and some picocells by investigating the interplay of different network processes and parameters such as channel allocation user association and reuse pattern 050to control inter-cell interference between picocells\051 We formulate a joint association channel allocation and inter 
cell interference management problem that relies on very few assumptions This problem turns out to be an Integer Non-Linear program that is NP-hard However its structure is such that we can solve it exactly for relatively large size systems We use optimal solutions as benchmarks to understand how different simple association schemes perform Our results show the critical impact of the association rules on system performance and shows the interplay of the different processes and parameters We believe that these insights will help design online association schemes in the future I I NTRODUCTION Current cellular wireless technologies are mainly based on 
homogeneous networks In such networks base stations follow a carefully planned layout and are largely identical in terms of power levels antenna con\002gurations backhaul capacities etc Base stations are carefully con\002gured to optimize coverage minimize interference with other base stations and ensure a roughly equivalent number of users in each cell While cell splitting can be used to accommodate growing traf\002c demands this can be problematic in dense urban environments Furthermore a typical modern base station in isolation employing advanced signal processing modulation and coding techniques is now near the Shannon limit of theoretical performance in terms of spectral ef\002ciency Hence to be 
able to support the anticipated high volumes of traf\002c in the future cellular operators will have to deploy a mix of network technologies The L TE-Adv anced standard for e xample proposes improvement to network-wide spectral ef\002ciency by employing a mix of macro pico femto and relay basestations 3 The context of this study is heterogeneous networks 050Hetnets\051 and their engineering and planning  Its purpose is twofold First it is to show the interplay between the many options that a cellular operator has to choose from when engineering a Hetnet in a given region and second to show the importance of understanding some of the tradeoffs at hand 
As our study is designed for the engineering phase of Hetnets 050as a step preceding the operational phase\051 it can be seen as a 002rst order study of the importance of some deployment decisions More precisely at the time of deployment the operator needs to take many decisions that are functions of the predicted pro\002le of the user population in the region under consideration 050e.g user distribution etc.\051 and the level of service to offer under nominal conditions Decisions to be taken should include the following four processes 1\051 Placement of the network components to be deployed 050types and quantities\051  Examples include but are not limited to the deployment of femto/pico access points 
distributed antennas and wired relays Each of these technologies has its own operational characteristics 050e.g transmitting power rates etc.\051 The operator will revisit this decision from time to time to add new components based on demands and measured performances 2\051 Interference management and resource allocation scheme  In homogeneous cellular networks a licensed frequency band is shared among the different cells using some frequency planning algorithm Inherent to the deployment of Hetnets is the challenge of intercell interference management and resource allocation Multiple options exist for managing interference and allocating resources in a Hetnet 5 and selecting the right 
option is a very hard problem 3\051 User association rule  An association policy de\002nes a set of rules for assigning users to the different available base stations in the Hetnet This includes decisions for users who are covered by more than one base station A decision to associate a user with a certain base station will affect the throughput seen by that user 4\051 User scheduling policy  User throughput is a function of the number of users associated with the same base station as well as the user scheduling policy implemented by the base station and the allocated resource Hence the choice of a scheduling policy will impact the system 
performance There is clearly a complex interplay between the different decisions an operator needs to take into account during the deployment phase It is thus important to perform studies that consider all these four processes namely placement interference management and resource allocation scheme association and scheduling In this paper we de\002ne precisely the Hetnet that we study in terms of these processes and we formulate a 223one-shot\224 joint association resource allocation

and inter-cell interference management problem that relies on very few assumptions We call the problem 223one-shot\224 because we assume that given some input variables 050de\002ned later\051 we compute at the same time all the parameters of our optimal con\002guration This problem turns out to be an Integer Non-Linear program that is NP-hard However its structure is such that we can solve it exactly for relatively large size systems We use these results as a benchmark to understand how different simple association schemes perform Our results show the critical impact of the association rules and the interplay of the different processes and parameters We believe that these insights will help design online schemes in the future that take the dynamics of the system into account In order to present our contributions in more details we need to describe precisely our system We consider a dense urban region covered by one macrocell and partially covered by X identical short range picocells We assume that the cellular network operator has an estimate of the users distribution in the region at peak hour time We assume that the macrocell and the picocells belong to the same operator and they are operated in the same licensed frequency band using an OFDM system Namely the Hetnet as a whole is allocated a frequency band that is divided into M subchannels 050we will use the term channels and subchannels interchangeably in the following\051 We adopt a 002xed channel allocation strategy between the macrocell and the picocells so that K channels are dedicated to the picocells 050and M 000 K channels to the macrocell\051 hence there is no interference between the macrocell and the set of picocells The K channels are equally divided among the picocells based on a given reuse factor u  By using a reuse factor we effectively do frequency planning for the picocells within the macrocell and by choosing u carefully the operator can keep the inter-pico cell interference manageable Clearly by taking u large we can avoid interference altogether but we allow much less channel reuse hence the choice of u will impact performance In our study both u and K are parameters that we want to con\002gure As mentioned earlier we are going to formulate a 223one-shot\224 optimization problem where we will con\002gure at once the values of K  u and the optimal association for each user  We assume that a user can only associate with one base-station at a given time We focus on the downlink and assume that the macrocell and all the picocells within it use the same scheduling policy based on maximizing the minimum user throughput Note that during the operating phase of the system the different parameters are con\002gured at different time scales Whenever X changes or N the number of users varies signi\002cantly K and u will be recomputed while the association is a dynamic process that is called whenever a user comes and goes Our study can be used to provide an upper bound on the performance that can be achieved since we are optimizing everything at once The closest work to ours is in which the authors consider the effect of user association on the network's throughput for a given 002xed partitioning of resources between the macrocell and some picocells 050there is no optimization made on the resource allocation\051 A simple association rule called 223Range Extension\224 is proposed and the authors show by simulation that it can improve the network's throughput as compared to another association rule based on SINR 050Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio\051 In 223Range Extension\224 users associate with the base station with the minimum path loss rather than the conventional rule in which users associate with the base station with the maximum downlink SINR In the performa nces of 223Range Extension\224 and the conventional association rule are compared under a speci\002c channel allocation in which the resources are equally divided between the macrocell and the picocells The authors show via simulation that the number of users served by picocells is already large enough with the conventional user association rule and 223Range Extension\224 does not improve users throughput signi\002cantly In T ongwei et al propose a new user association rule called 223Based on Queue 050BQ\051\224 that associates more users with the picocells and they compare its performance under two different resource allocation schemes called 223Overlap ICIC\224 and 223Non-overlap ICIC\224 In 223Overlap ICIC\224 macrocell nodes use half of the available frequency while picocells can use the entire frequency band In 223Nonoverlap ICIC\224 the available bandwidth is equally divided between macrocells and the picocells Finally it is shown via simulation that the new scheme works better than 223Range Extension\224 and the conventional user association rule Our contributions are 1\051 We formulate a one-shot joint user association channel allocation and reuse pattern optimization problem for a heterogenous network that consists of one macrocell and many picocells under a 002xed channel allocation strategy We make no restricting assumptions on the channel gains the rate functions and the overlapping of the picocells In spite of the fact that this problem is an Integer Non Linear problem we are able to solve it exactly numerically for relatively large systems 2\051 We use the numerical results as a benchmark to quantify how well 3 simple association rules perform including the one proposed in Another contrib ution is to sho w that u  1 is almost always the best solution 3\051 We study the impact of K  the number of channels allocated to the pool of picocells and show how different association rules perform when K is not computed optimally but given Altogether our study emphasizes the importance of looking at the engineering problem in its globality as opposed to looking at each process independently The paper is organized as follows The problem setup and formulation of the performance optimization problem is introduced in Section II In Section III the 3 simple association rules that we will study are introduced Numerical results are provided in Section IV The conclusions are given in Section V II P ROBLEM S ETUP AND F ORMULATION Consider an OFDM system composed of a macrocell

that there are M subchannels available on the downlink to serve N users in the system where each subchannel is of bandwidth b  Assume also that each base station assigns equal power to all of its subchannels where P 0 denotes the transmission power of the macrocell base station and P denotes the transmission power of each picocell base station Let 015 j i denote the SINR at the location of user i from base station j and r j i  f 050 015 j i 051 denote the rate in bps/Hz assigned to the user Here f 050 001 051 is a rate function that maps the SINR to the corresponding rate The deployed Modulation and Coding Scheme 050MCS\051 de\002nes f 050 001 051  This function is typically a given discrete step function 050 13 and 14]\051 We adopt a 002xed channel allocation strategy between the macrocell and the picocells so that out of the M channels available K channels are allocated to the picocells and M 000 K channels are left to the macrocell The K channels are equally divided among the picocells based on a given reuse factor u where 1 024 u 024 X  We choose u so that if a channel is reserved for the exclusive use of the picocells it cannot be used at the same time by more than d X  u e picocells Given a reuse factor u  there are in general multiple possible reuse patterns Let P 050 u 051 be the set of such reuse patterns By using a reuse factor and a reuse pattern we effectively do frequency planning for the picocells within the macrocell In our system there is no co-channel interference for macrocell users 050i.e 015 0 i is effectively an SNR\051 while picocell users may suffer from co-channel interference and 015 j i is a function of both u and the reuse pattern We assume that each user can be associated with only one cell In this respect let x ij  1 if user i is associated with cell j and 0 otherwise Thus P j 2B x ij  1 for all i where B denotes the set of base stations We assume that the macrocell and the picocells use the same user scheduling policy to maximize the minimum throughput of users associated with any cell Thus for a given cell j  all users associated with the cell will receive the same rate Let 025 j denote such rate To compute 025 j  let B j denote the bandwidth allocated to cell j 050i.e B j  n j b where n j is the number of channels allocated to j and b is the width in Hz of a channel\051 and let A j be the set of users associated with cell j  For each user i 2 A j  025 j satis\002es 013 i B j f 050 015 j i 051  025 j  8 i 2 A j  0501\051 X i 2A j 013 i  1 0502\051 where 013 i is the proportion of time that user i is scheduled on the downlink Hence 025 j is given by 025 j  B j  P i 2A j 1  f 050 015 j i 051  0503\051 In this study K  u  and f x ij g are the parameters we aim to con\002gure Our problem can be

implicit in 015 j i since the SINR depends on the reuse pattern implemented Such dependence is not indicated explicitly in the problem to reduce notational burden on the reader Problem P 0 is a non-linear integer program which is hard to solve However if K and 050 u P 050 u 051\051 are 002xed a linear integer program in f x i;j g can be formulated Namely given a value of K  K 0 2 f 0  1  001

can be obtained by solving P 1 050 K 0  u 0  P 050 u 0 051\051 for all possible values of K 0 and 050 u 0  P 050 u 0 051\051 and then selecting the largest solution In particular de\002ne the solution for P 1 for a given K  u  and P 050 u 051 as 025  1 050 K u P 050 u 051\051  Hence the solution for P 0 can be obtained by solving max f K;u P 050 u 051 g f 025  1 050 K u P 050 u 051\051 g  0506\051 Still this approach can lead to an exhaustive set of problems to solve Namely assume that each user can hear at least two

base stations then P 1 will have 2 002 N variables and it needs to be solved M 002 jPj times where P denotes the set of reuse patterns However we were able to solve P 0 in this manner for a system of 16 picocells placed on a grid with 350 users We consider the cases u  1  2  3  4 with one reuse pattern for each reuse factor Those results helped us obtain some engineering insights of the performance of a set of existing and proposed association rules as will be shown in the sequel In the next section we describe those rules and provide comparisons with the optimal association as obtained by solving P 0  III S IMPLE U SER A SSOCIATION R ULES The following user association rules are considered in our study 1\051 SINR-based  A user i associates with base station j   arg max j 0  1  001\001\001 X f 015 j i g  This is the association rule used today in homogeneous networks This rule is known not to perform well in a heterogeneous setting because a macrocell base station usually transmits at a higher power level than picocell base stations Hence with this association rule most of the users will have a better SINR from the macrocell than any of the picocells and will associate with the macrocell This rule is thus not favorable from a channel reuse standpoint 2\051 Picocell First  A user i associates with the picocell base station j   arg max j 1  001\001\001 X f 015 j i g as long as 015 j  i  014 where 014 is a parameter to tune The motivation behind this rule is the premise of heterogeneous networks that try to bring base stations closer to the users to improve their rates In this respect the rule tends to favor association with the picocells 3\051 Range Extension  A user i associates with the base station j   arg min j 0  1  001\001\001 X f 016 j i g where 016 j i is the path loss from base station of cell j to user i  This is another rule to favor association with picocells Simplicity of these rules comes at the expense of load balancing among base stations The optimal association takes load balancing into account by associating users with base stations such that the minimum throughput is maximized For each of 3 rules we can compute beforehand what will be the values of x ij for all users i if we 002x a reuse factor u 0 and a reuse pattern P 050 u 0 051  In that case the problem P 0 reduces to the following problem that computes the value of K given f x ij g and the reuse factor and reuse pattern 050 u 0  P 050 u 0 051\051  P 2  max f K g 025 0507a\051 Kb  u 0 P N i 1 x ij  r j i 025 025 8 j 2 f 1  001 001 001  X g 0507b\051 050 M 000 K 051 b  P

as 025  2 050 u P 050 u 051\051  Hence the solution for P 2 is given by max f u P 050 u 051 g f 025  2 050 u P 050 u 051\051 g  0508\051 We are now ready to obtain results on the joint optimal association resource allocation and reuse factor/pattern and to compare them with the cases where the association rule is given Note that while P 0 jointly optimizes the association the reuse pattern/factor and the resource allocation parameter K  and P 2 jointly optimizes the reuse pattern/factor and the resource allocation parameter K for a given association we can also easily use a version of P 0 to optimize the association given a reuse pattern/factor and the resource allocation parameter K  In that case the optimal association will perform load balancing and mitigate interference and resource availability at best as possible IV N UMERICAL R ESULTS We consider a system composed of a macrocell 050cell 0\051 and X picocells 050cells j  1  001 001 001  X 051 It is assumed that the macrocell covers a square area of length L  1000 m  We consider two different con\002gurations In con\002guration 1 there are X  16 picocells located inside the square on a grid of size p  X 002 p  X  and in con\002guration 2 there are X  7 picocells located in the square as shown in Fig 1 The number of subchannels allocated to the system is taken to be 100  each of bandwidth b  180 kHz  In this study we consider only reuse patterns of the type 050 u h  u v 051 where u h and u v de\002ne respectively the horizontal and vertical distance 050 u h L  p  X  u v L  p  X 051 of the closest picocell base station that can use the same channel subset Thus each picocell is granted a number of channels K  u  where u  u h 002 u v  For con\002guration 1 the set of reuse factors is U  f 1  2  3  4 g  and the set of reuse patterns is P  f 1 002 1  1 002 2  1 002 3  2 002 2 g  For con\002guration 2 the set of reuse factors is U  f 1  2  3  4 g  and the reuse patterns that we considered are shown in Table I In both con\002gurations some users could 223hear\224 050i.e get an SINR greater than the SINR threshold for the minimum rate in the deployed Modulation and Coding Scheme 050MCS\051\051 more than one picocell base station beside the macrocell base station We use a SINR model that accounts for path loss and slow fading P ath losses are computed based on a typical LTE system and slo w f ading is modeled by log-normal shadowing with mean zero and standard deviation 8 dB The

05010\051 respectively We assume that the system uses adaptive modulation with discrete rates Table III taken from 12 13 and 14 gives us the mapping between the SINR and the ef\002ciency e for the modulation and coding scheme for LTE In this table there are 15 levels let  be such a level Hence the bit rate seen by a user that has a SINR between level  and level   1 is r  022e   SC ofdm SY ofdm

subcarriers per subchannel bandwidth SY ofdm is the number of OFDM symbols per subframe and T subframe is the frame duration in time units For example in the v alues of SC ofdm  SY ofdm  T subframe  and sub-channel bandwidth are 12 11 1ms and 180KHz respectively In this study we normalize the rates to 022 for simplicity since this normalization does not affect the results Since we are using a discrete rate model 050adaptive modulation\051 we need to consider a minimum SINR threshold for the 223Range Extension\224 association rule otherwise a user could associate with a base station while its SINR is less than the minimum SINR threshold of the corresponding MCS and hence it will not get any rate In the following numerical results we are considering the same value 050in dB\051 for the SINR threshold of 223Range Extension\224 and 014 for 223Picocell First\224 To compare the performance of the three association rules with the optimal solution two con\002gurations are considered as shown in Fig 1 and based on these con\002gurations we have de\002ned 2 scenarios 050in each of them all base stations use the MCS given in Table III\051 Scenario 1 In this scenario we use Con\002guration 1 There are N  350 uniformly distributed users Scenario 2 In this scenario we use Con\002guration 2 There are 150 uniformly distributed users In addition to those 150 users there are 200 users distributed uniformly in two hotspots shown in Figure 1 Hence in this scenario N  350  For each scenario and each reuse factor u  we computed the max-min rate for each scheme for at least 10 realizations For each realization N users are placed at random in the region based on the distribution described for the scenario at hand and then the users rates are computed We use AMPL 050the commercial software 223A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming\224\051 and CPLEX to compute e xact results for P 0 and P 2 050i.e when an association rule is 002xed\051 We show in the following 002gures a typical realization The max-min rate of the system is shown in Figure 2 050without shadowing\051 and Figure 3 050with shadowing\051 as a function of the reuse factor u for scenario 1 and in Figures 4 050without shadowing\051 and 5 050with shadowing\051 for scenario 2 In these scenarios we are comparing the performance of the joint optimization of the association and the channel allocation with the performance of the simple association rules when K is computed optimally for the simple rules For each scenario we selected the value of 014 that gave the highest possible max-min rate 050for the optimal association\051 over the range of u that we consider i.e 014  000 2  6 dB for scenario 1 and 014  11  8 dB for scenario 2 For each association rule the curve shows the highest max-min rate over all values of K for a given u  The results show that 223Picocell First\224 and 223Range Extension\224 are performing relatively well 050but not very well in the case with

Fig. 3 illustrates two cases of the data ratio in the clusters. For example, cluster 1 in case 1 contains 43% of the 305 patterns so we set both minimum support and confidence to 57  Fig. 3. Cluster results for case 1 and case 2 The result of this case is compared with the case that only uses DHP to mine all 305 patterns without using Fuzzy ART2. Table II compares the results. Note that, min_sup and min_conf for mining all 305 patterns will be set lower than Acontainingtuples BandAbothcontainingtuplesBAconfidence ___ ______     that of each cluster because each cluster after clustering has the similar properties From Table II, we can see that the results of association rules of combining 3 clusters \(after mining separately clusters without fuzzy ATR2 time to process The purpose of the other experiment is to find out the effect of the number of membership functions on the association rules. The number of membership functions for the patient age attribute and the number of positive auxiliary nodes attribute will be respectively changed to 5 membership functions as shown in Fig. 4 \(case 2, the vigilance value is set to 3.4 case 1  Fig. 4. Linguistic terms of attribute 1 and attribute 3 for case 2 The results are presented in Table III and Table IV. In this case, the dataset is clustered into 5 clusters \(larger than that of case 1 57, 85 and 19. And the same as the case 1, the association rules are similar with or without using fuzzy ART2 Two cases take full advantage of fuzzy ART2 in finding association rules. It separates the dataset into some smaller groups to reduce the computational cost V. CONCLUSIONS 


This study proposes a novel approach for finding association rules from medical data. The combination of fuzzy model and ART2 neural network is developed to cluster the fuzzified dataset into several groups with similar properties. The groups are then particularly exploited for finding the association rules. The approach shows that the more computationally efficiency can be obtained by reducing processing time. An application considered is to group the patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer into groups that have the similar properties to use group association rules. The experimental results show that the discovered association rules are exactly the same with the conventional approach. The merit of this research is that the computational time is significantly reduced and the approach can be applied to a variety of domains REFERENCES 1] M. H. Margahny and A. A.

to be a well-suited performance measure for MC tasks where the number of negative instances significantly exceeds the number of positive instances [6]. Another advantage of AUPRC is its global nature and independence of a certain threshold value. The closer the AUPRC value is to 1, the better the performance Since these measures are based on the comparison of multi-labels, they depend on a transformation from rankings to classes. As a contrast we also used four wellknown ranking-based performance measures: One-Error OE RL C cision \(AP  for all ranking-based performance measures except AP. OneError evaluates how many times the top-ranked label is not in the set of proper labels of the instance. Ranking Loss is defined as the average fraction of pairs of labels that are ordered incorrectly. Coverage evaluates how far we need, on average, to go down the list of labels in order to cover all the proper labels of the instance. Average Precision evaluates the average fraction of labels ranked above a particular label i ? mt which actually are in mt And finally, the special hierarchical loss function H-loss 2] were utilized. Following [3], normalized costs were calculated: ci := 1/|c\(p\(i i ? L i of all direct children of i. Hierarchical loss \(H-loss consider mistakes made in subtrees of incorrectly predicted labels and penalizes only the first mistake along the path from the root to a node. The smaller the H-loss value, the better the performance B. 20 Newsgroups Dataset We modified the popular single-label dataset 20 Newsgroups [18], [19] by considering eight additional labels corresponding to the intermediate levels of the hierarchy faith, recreation, recreation/sport, recreation/vehicles, politics, computer, computer/hardware, science. This dataset is a collection of almost 20,000 postings from 20 newsgroups sorted by date into training \(60 40 data were preprocessed by discarding all words appearing only in the test documents and all words found in the stop word list [20]. Afterwards, all but the 2%-most-frequent words were eliminated to reduce the dimensionality. Documents were represented using the well-known TF-IDF \(Term 


Frequency  Inverse Document Frequency scheme [19]. The TF-IDF weights were then normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Conversion to TF-IDF and normalization were performed separately for training and test data. This resulted in the 1,070-dimensional dataset with 11,256 training instances, 7,493 test ones and 28 labels To test the performance of two HE algorithms, we first extracted hierarchies from the True Test Multi-Labels \(TTML and calculated the corresponding proximity measures. Both algorithms successfully extracted the original hierarchy We studied the performance of the multi-label classifiers and their ability to infer the class hierarchies in the presence of only partly available hierarchical information. We performed a series of HE experiments with multi-labels having a decreasing number of inserted non-leaf labels describing the levels in the hierarchy. We randomly removed such labels from 20%, 30%, and 40% of the training instances leaving them single-labeled. The results for predicted test multilabels are shown in Table I where the bold face marks the best classifier, and the first column \(left result of HE by Voting and the second \(right Thresholding \(referred as GT Comparing classification performance, one can see that the ART-based networks are superior to both the other classifiers in terms of most performance measures and that ML-FAM slightly outperforms ML-ARAM. Taken together they win on at least 6 and at most 8 out of 9 evaluation measures. BoosTexter has the second best performance, but its predictive power degrades more quickly with the increase in the number of single-label instances. The poorest MC results were shown by ML-kNN, its performance decreased very fast with any reduction in the number of multi-labels For example, F1 decreased by 15% while removing 40% of labels instead of 30%. It is also interesting to note that when trained on the dataset with 40% removed labels, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM significantly outperformed ML-kNN trained on the original dataset with all labels The hierarchy proximity measures confirm the good quality of predictions produced by the ART-based networks: The hierarchies were correct extracted by both HE algorithms of Section II-B even with 40% removed labels. The predictions of ML-kNN were the worst: The Voting variant of the HE 


algorithm could not extract the correct hierarchy with 30 assigning five labels incorrectly to the root label. None of the HE algorithms could extract the correct hierarchy in the absence of 40% multi-labels. With 40% and Voting, the number of labels falsely assigned to the root was 13, while with GT it was only three. For BoosTexter, Voting assigned two labels wrongly to the root label in the experiment with TABLE I 20 NEWSGROUPS ALL, -20%, -30% AND -40% RESULTS Measure all 20% 30% 40%ARAM FAM kNN BoosT.

GT resulted in zero distances in the both cases. Assigning more labels to the root creates more shallow and wider hierarchies \(trivial case as stated before The good hierarchy extraction with ART networks demonstrates the system robustness  even with strongly damaged data the system can rebuild the original hierarchy C. RCV1-v2 Dataset The next experiment was based on the tokenized version of 


the RCV1-v2 dataset introduced in [21]. Only the topics label set consisting of 103 labels arranged in a hierarchy of depth four is examined here. Documents of the original training set of 23,149 were converted to TF-IDF weights and normalized Afterwards the set was splitted in 15,000 randomly selected documents as training and the remaining as test samples In this case, the Voting variant of HE applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values 0.12, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively. The corresponding values of the GT variant are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.05. The poor performance of the Voting method is due to the fact that for the TTML only very high threshold values succeed in removing enough noise The Voting results are thus dominated by bad hierarchies extracted for all but the highest thresholds The classification and HE results for this dataset are shown in Table II. ML-ARAM has better performance results on this data set in all points than ML-FAM except for RL being the best of all classifiers in terms of the multi-label performance measures. BoosTexter is the best in terms of all ranking measures For both HE algorithms the distances of BoosTexter are the best, those of ML-FAM second, followed ML-ARAM and ML-kNN. All three distance measures correlate. Interesting is also that for ML-kNN the distance values obtained by both HE methods are almost the same The hierarchy extracted by GT from the TTML has much lower distances values as compared with the hierarchies extracted by both methods from predicted multi-labels. This reflects a specific problem of HE, since only a small fraction of the incorrectly classified multi-labels can prevent building of a proper hierarchy. For example, 16.5% of misassigned labels in the extracted hierarchy are responsible for about 80% of LCAPD calculated from the predictions of MLARAM. This large part of the HE error is caused by only 4% of the test data. Under these circumstances the other distances behave analogically. Most labels were not assigned making them trivial edges, but six labels were assigned to a false branch. This can happen when labels have a strong correlation and in the step Hierarchy Construction of the basic algorithm the parent is not unique in the confidence matrix. BoosTexters results suffer less from this problem because it generally sets more labels for each test sample 


Both HE algorithms behaved similarly on the predictions of the ART networks. They constructed a deeper hierarchy than the original one and wrongly assigned the same 11 labels to the root node. The higher distances come from Voting assigning more labels to the wrong branch. For MLkNN both algorithms again create very similar hierarchy trees, both misassigned 28 labels to the root label. For BoosTexter it was seven with Voting and eight with GT Voting produced a deeper hierarchy here D. WIPO-alpha Dataset The WIPO-alpha dataset1 comprises patent documents collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO ments. Preprocessing was performed as follows: From each document, the title, abstract and claims texts were extracted stop words were removed using the list from [20] and words were stemmed using the Snowball stemmer [22]. All but the 1%-most-frequent stems were removed, the remaining stems were converted to TF-IDF weights and these were normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Again, TF-IDF conversion and normalization were done independently for the training and the test set. The original hierarchy consists, from top to bottom, of 8 sections, 120 classes, 630 subclasses and about 69,000 groups. In our experiment, only records from the sections A \(5802 training and 5169 test samples H \(5703 training and 5926 test samples 1http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ITsupport/Categorization dataset/wipo-alpha-readme.html August 2009 TABLE II RCV1-V2 RESULTS Measure ARAM FAM kNN BoosT A 0.748 0.731 0.651 0.695 F1 0.795 0.777 0.735 0.769 F 0.805 0.787 0.719 0.771 OE 0.077 0.089 0.104 0.063 RL 0.087 0.086 0.026 0.015 C 11.598 11.692 8.563 5.977 AP 0.868 0.860 0.839 0.873 AUPRC 0.830 0.794 0.807 0.838 H-loss 0.068 0.077 0.097 0.081 Wins 4 0 0 5 LCAPD 0.29 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.34 0.34 0.21 0.18

Both main and secondary codes were used in the experiment, although codes pointing to groups outside of sections A and H were ignored. We also removed groups that did not contain at least 30 training and 30 test records \(and any documents that only belonged to such small groups 7,364 test records with 924 attributes each and a label set of size 131 In this case, the Voting variant of the HE algorithm applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values of 0.13, 0.12 and 0, respectively. GT showed the same values. Remarkable are the TO* distances, which are equal to 0. This is due to the fact that the WIPO-alpha hierarchy contains 16 single-child labels that are not partitioned by the true multi-labels: whenever a single-child label j is contained in a multi-label, so is its child, and vice versa. It is therefore theoretically impossible to deduce from the multilabels which of them is the parent of the other. As a result the HE algorithms often choose the wrong parent, resulting in higher LCAPD and CTED values. TO*, as described above is invariant under such choices The results obtained on the WIPO-alpha dataset are shown in Table III. The classification performance of the ART-based networks on this dataset is slightly worse than that of BoosTexter. Mostly in the terms of OE, RL, C, AP, AUPRC, and H-loss measures BoosTexter is better because its rankings are better and it assigned more labels to each sample. But the ART networks have better HE results because their predicted labels are more consistent with the original hierarchy. MLkNN has the worst classification results and distance values again. The reason for the high relative difference between LCAPD as well as CTED and TO* obtained for the ART networks or BoosTexter as compared to the results of the other datasets is because most of the labels were assigned in the right branch but not exactly where they belong Both HE algorithms extracted the same hierarchy from the predictions of ML-ARAM and a very similar hierarchy for ML-FAM. About 5% labels were assigned wrongly to the 


root label in the hierarchies of the ART networks.

Here, GT extracted a much worse hierarchy as shown by CTED being 0.15 higher for GT than for Voting For BoosTexter both HE methods built the same hierarchy and no label was wrongly assigned to the root. All extracted hierarchies were one level deeper than the original one Although Voting produced worse hierarchies than GT on two previous datasets, this time its distance values were comparable or even better. In comparison to Voting, GT has higher values for all distances on the multi-labels of MLkNN. Voting has the advantage of being a much simpler method and of being more dataset independent. Still the tree distances have the same ranking order for all classifiers for both HE methods VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC tive was to derive hierarchical relationships between output classes from predicted multi-labels automatically. We have developed a data-mining-system based on two recently proposed multi-label extensions of the FAM and ARAM neural networks: ML-FAM and ML-ARAM as well as on a Hierarchy Extraction \(HE algorithm builds association rules from label co-occurrences 


and has two modifications. The presented approach is general enough to be used with any other multi-label classifier or HE algorithm. We have also developed a new tree distance measure for quantitative comparison of hierarchies In extensive experiments made on three text-mining realworld datasets, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM were compared against two state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers: ML-kNN and BoosTexter. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is suitable for extracting middle and large-scale class hierarchies from predicted multi-labels.

The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
