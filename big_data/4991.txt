approaches of association rule mining many of which are redundant so that they are difficult for users to understand and make use of Agrawal et al pointed out the bottleneck of transaction number increase association rules according to the index increase To solve this problem a new method was represented which is based on restricted conditional probability distribution to get a condensed rules set by removing redundant rnles Our set of rules is more meaningful more concise and users are interested in than others Especially the number of rules in rules-set has been reduced greatly We find that it is an effective method of association rules mining from examples finally poses future research Klrywords-Data Mining Association Rules Restricted Conditional Probability Distribution 1 INTRODUCTION Data mmmg is the process of abstracting unaware potential and useful information and knowledge from plentiful incomplete noisy fuzzy and stochastic data  It is a multidisciplinary fields including database technology  artificial intelligence machine learning neural networks statistics pattern recognition knowledge-based systems knowledge acquisition information retrieval high performance computing and data visualization Data mining functionalities are used to speciiY the kind of patterns to be found in data mining tasks In general data mining tasks can be classified into two categories descriptive and predictive Descriptive mining tasks characterize the general properties of the data in the database Predictive mining tasks perform inference on the current data in order to make predictions Early data mining applications focused mainly on helping businesses gain a competitive edge As data mining becomes more popular it is increasingly used for the exploration of applications in other areas such as biomedicine  financial analysis DNA analysis financial analysis the retail industry and telecommunications In addition the exploration of data mining for businesses continues to expand as e-commerce and e-marketing become mainstream elements of the retail industry In this paper We describe an algorithm for mining association rules with restricted conditional probability distribution which reduces the redundancy rules greatly we find that it is an effective method of association rules mining from examples some future research are provided as well

mining finds interesting association or correlation relationships among a large set of data items With massive amounts of data continuously being collected and stored many industries are becoming interested in mining association rules from their databases The discovery of interesting association relationships amounts of business transaction records can help in many business decision making processes such as catalog design cross-marketing and loss-leader analysis  A typical example of association rules mining is market basket analysis The original definition of association rule mining 4  by Agrawal Imielinski Swami is defined as Let I  i 1  i 2    in be a set of n binary attributes called items Let D  t l  t 2    t m  be a set of transactions called the database Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I A rule is defined as an implication of the form X  Y where X Y  I and X n Y  l  The sets of items X and Yare called antecedent and consequent right-hand-side of the rule respectively The rules X Y holds in the transaction set D with support s where s is the percentage of transactions in D that contain X u Y This is taken to be the probability p\(X u Y The rules X Y has confidence c in the transaction set D if c is the percentage of transactions in D containing X that also contain Y This is taken to be the conditional probability p\(YIX That is sup port\(X  Y  p\(X u Y 1 conjidence\(X  Y  p\(YIX 2 Rule support and confidence are two measures of rule interestingness They respectively reflect the usefulness and certainty of discovered rules Typically association rules are considered interesting if they satisfy both a minimum support threshold and a minimum confidence threshold Such thresholds can be set by users or domain experts  Many algorithms for generating association rules were presented over time Such as Apriori Eclat and FP-Growth but they only do half the job since they are algorithms for mining frequent itemsets each of these itemsets will occur at I EEE 000 000c\000o\000m\000p\000u\000t\000e\000r\000 SOCiety 


least as frequently as a pre-determined minimwn support COllllt Another step needs to be done after to generate rules from frequent itemsets fOlllld in a database these rules must satisfy mmnnwn support and minimwn confidence Additional interestingness measures can be applied if desired The second step is the easiest of the two The overall performance of mining association rules is determined by the first step Apriori  is the best kno"\\iVll algorithm to mine association rules It uses a breadth first search strategy to COllllting the support of itemsets and uses a candidate generation fllllction which exploits the dO"\\iVllward closure property of support Apriori  is an influential algorithm for mining frequent itemsets for Boolean association rules The name of the algorithm is based on the fact that the algorithm uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties as we shall see below Apriori employs an iterative approach known as a level-wise search where k-itemsets are used to explore\(k+l Figure 1 shows preudocode for the Apriori algorithm and its related procedures Step 1 of Apriori finds the frequent l-itemsets 4 In steps 2-10 L k _ 1 is used to generate candidates C k in order to find L k  The apriori Een procedure generates the candidates and then uses the Apriori property to eliminate those having a subset that is not frequent\(step 3 Once all the candidates have been generated the database is scanned\(step 4 For each transaction a subset fimction is used to find all subsets of the transaction that are candidates\(step 5 and the COllllt for each of these candidates is accumulated\(step 6 and 7 Fimlly all those candidates satisfying minimwn support form the set of frequent itemsets L  A procedure can then be called to enerate association rules from the frequent itemsets Algorithm Apriori Find frequent itemsets usmg an iterative level-wise approach based on candidate generation Input Database D of transactions;minimwn support tbreshold,min _sup Output L frequent itemsets in D Method I L 000~\000f\000i\000n\000d\000J\000r\000e\000q\000u\000e\000n\000t\000_\000l\000-\000i\000t\000e\000m\000s\000e\000t\000s\000\(\000D\000 2 for k=2 L k _ 1  I  k 3 Ck=apriori_gen\(L k _ 1  min_sup 4 for each transaction tED  5 Ct=subset\(C k  t 6 for each candidate c E C t 7 c cOllllt 8 Lk  c E Ckl c count min_sup 9 return L  ukL k  Figure I The Apriori Algorithm 518 III ALGORITIlM DETAILS In the process of mining association rules with the transaction to increase the nwnber of association rules set to increase exponentially particularly support and confidence thresholds when small To avoid this situation we can add some constraints into the algorithms for mining association rules Based on the above point this paper details the means of restricted conditional probability distribution to constrain the mining association rules algorithm  A Some Basic Concepts Restricted conditional probability distribution abbreviated as RCPD  Let X and Y are two disjoint sets of variables a conditional probability distribution P r IX  a restricted conditional probability distribution p fiX is a subset of the P y IX  by specifYing Domoin\(X c Domoin\(X and Domoin Y c Domoin Y The following with P Y IX instead of p Y IX  Minimal conditional subset abbreviated as MCS  Let X and Y are two disjoint sets of variables if x is a subset of X and the following three conditions are met then we say x is the minimal conditional subset of X on Y 1 PcyIX 000~\000 PcyIX 2 VZ c X X PcyIX  PcyIX',Z 3 Does not exist X c X satisfy the above conditions Minimal conditional probability distribution abbreviated as MCPD  Let X and Y are two disjoint sets of variables and x is the minimal conditional subset of X on Y The restricted conditional probability distribution p fiX  is the minimal conditional distribution of p fiX on Y If X is the minimwn on Y then p\(fIX is the minimal conditional probability of its own  B Detoiled Process of the Algorithm We designed the algorithm mainly include the following steps 1 Choose a constraint attribute item i 2 According to the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules generate the frequent item sets which include item i and stored in L I  3 Use the algorithm GenAR for generating association rules GenAR is the use of restricted conditional probability distribution to find association rules 4 Remove redlllldant association rules If a frequent itemset is another frequent itemsets subset then it generates the association rules is redlllldant and should be deleted Figure 2 shows pseudocode for the GenAR algorithm and its related procedures
