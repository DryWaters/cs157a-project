How to make use of the rich knowledge in the Wiki is a big challenge. In this paper we propose a method to construct domain ontology from the Chinese Wiki automatically  The main idea in this paper is based on the entry segmenting and Feature Text \(FT\ extracting, where we segment the name of entries and establish the concept hierarchy firstly. Secondly, we extract the FTs from the descriptions of entries to eliminate the redundant information. Finally we calculate the similarity between pairs of FTs to revise the concept hierarchy and gain non-taxonomy relations between concepts. The primary experiment indicates that our method is useful for Chinese domain ontology construction   1. Introduction  Wikipedia \(Wiki\ is an environment where web users are able to share their knowledge about a certain topic [1   The Wiki includes many entries. Each entry has a corresponding web page-- description  Obviously, the knowledge offered by Wiki is loose arrangement, which lacks of well concept hierarchy structure and the logical inference mechanism. Therefore it makes computer systems difficult to deal with the content of Wiki in a semantic way. A potential solution is to use ontologies which are established based on Wiki There has been much research on the construction ontology from free text. The major automated methods are the pattern-based method [1 t h e s t a t i s t i c ba s e d  m e t h od  7   the dictionary based method [8  t h e c o r r e la tio n  r u le s b a s e d  method [9  a n d t h e  kn ow l e d g e  ba s e m e t h od 1 0    Constructing ontology from Wiki is different from constructing ontology from the free text. First, the entries in Wiki can be considered as concepts directly. Secondly, the contents of entries of Wiki are shorter with few words. It is difficult to extract the relations without other accessorial corpora. Thirdly, Wiki allows users to freely create and edit description content using any Web browser. Therefore there exists redundant data in Wiki’s content, which will disturb the forming of the hierarchy In this paper we propose a method to construct the Chinese domain ontologies from Wiki based on the entry segmenting and feature text \(FT\ extracting automatically The method does not need accessorial corpora. It extracts the FTs from the descriptions of entries to eliminate the redundant information The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes the architecture for the .ontology construction Section 3 introduces the processing of automated ontology construction and the relative technology. Section 4 explains the experimental results on the wine ontology construction from baidu Wiki [4 F i n a l l y  s e c t i o n 5 dr a w s t h e  conclusion  2  The architecture of system  Figure 1 displays the architecture of our system to automated construct the Chinese domain ontology from Wiki according the feature of the Wiki  Ontology uses classes to represent concepts. It also supports taxonomy and non-taxonomy relations between classes. So, a common ontology learning system comprises three basic stages: the domain terminology extraction concept hierarchy arrangement, and the non-taxonomy relations discovering [5  Th e co n cep t  h i e r ar c h y

  arrangement is according the taxonomy relations    Figue1 the architecture of system to automated construct the Chinese domain ontology from Wiki  There are five steps to accomplish three basic stages in our system. They are Web page pre-processing, entry segmenting and concept clustering, feature text \(FT extracting, FTs similarity calculating, and property finding which are described below 1\Web page preprocessing Wiki offer some entries about the same topic. Each entry has a corresponding web page. These web pages have a similar structure, which has an entry and a description This step partitions Wiki web pages into entries and descriptions according the html tags and web page pattern The entries can be treated as the concepts directly 2\ Entry segmenting and concept clustering This step forms the concepts hierarchy using entries Chinese entry consists of terms 021 There is semantic information in the combinatorial sequence of these terms The system uses a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm: ES \(Entry Segment\ algorithm to segment and cluster the entries \(concepts\ at the same time. The ES algorithm maps entries to concepts in a hierarchy according the name compounding. The hierarchy is rough. Some entries are located in an error place 3\eature text \(FT\ extracting This step deals with descriptions which are generated by step1. In the description, several of information is mixed together. Only the Feature Text \(FT\, which embodies its dissimilarity with other entries, is needed. To eliminate the disturbed information, we extract the feature text from the description at first. The hierarchy generated by step2 is an assistant data in this step 4\ FTs similarity calculating The FT is a definition of an entry. It contains several sentences. Each sentence contains terms. The system uses the proportion of cooccurrence terms to calculate the similarity between FTs. If the similarity is 1, there is a sameas” relation between entries. If the similarity between FTs is larger than a threshold, they are sibling. The system locates the entry according its sibling’s location. This step revises the concept hierarchy   5\ Property finding  In the ontology, the sibling concepts are differentiated by the properties of concepts. Same property name and different property value form the classified rule. From a contrasting point of view, the system uses the hierarchy and FTs to find the property of concepts  3  Automated ontology construction  3.1 002  Entry segmenting and concept clustering  Chinese entry’s name consists of terms. There is semantic information in the combinatorial sequence of these terms. Most Chinese entry includes a subject term and several decoration terms. The subject term usually locate in the last portion of the entry. For example, an entry drywhiterwine 024F,Q:59ØG has a subject term alcohol G and three decoration terms : “dry 024F  white Q and “grape 59 It has a meaning: alcohol which has a dry taste, white color and brewed by grape There is no space between terms of Chinese entry name. So, the entry name must be segment at first. There are many tools for Chinese term segment. They are not fit for the specific domain. So, we design a name segment method, which is a byproduct of concepts clustering Because all the entries are talk about the same topic the subject term will appear time after time. So, we use a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm: ES \(Entry Segment\ algorithm to segment and cluster the entries concepts\ at the same time  ES algorithm Input All entries E=\(e 1 e 2 e n  Output classification tree F 1   for\( i=1; i<=n; i   c i e i f i e i add c i  as a leaf node in the tree F 2 for\( n=max\( len\(f i n>1;n 2 1: using formula \(4\to calculate the threshold t  2 2: for any cluster c i 2.2.1 for any cluster c j  using formula \(1\ calculate the similarity sim c i  c j  if  sim\(ci,cj\>t  c k  c i 001 c j  c j NULL;  f j NULL  2.2.2  c i NULL;  f i NULL f k is the n-1 right side sub string of f i add c k  as a node in the tree F 3: End 1\ Web pages preprocessing  2 002 entry segmenting and concepts clustering Descriptions 3 002 feature text \(FT extracting  FTs 5 002 property finding  Concepts hierarchy feedback 4 002 FTs similarity calculating  Non-taxonomy relations concepts entries Ontology Wiki web pages

  ES algorithm is an improved hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. At first, each entry is treated as a cluster f i which is a string, is the feature of the cluster c i Because the algorithm deals with the entries concepts\ name, the level of the hierarchy is less than the maximum length of entry name. The similarity between clusters is the measure of distance between clusters. Using formula \(1\ to calculate the similarity between the cluster c i  and the cluster  c j  000       min 1         j i e e k j i k j i f f W k c c sim 002  1 f i is the feature of the cluster c i  f j is the feature of the cluster c j  They are strings also. The string consists of terms In the formula k is the position of the term from the right side. The parameter   k 002 embodies the effect of the position k of term. It ensures that the term located in the right side is more important than the left. The function    j i k f f W is used to compare the terms at the same position k  k k   1 2   002  002 2 002   jk ik jk ik j i k f f f f f f W  003   1 1     002 3 002  We use formula \(4\ to calculate the similarity threshold t      1 1 n k t n k 002 002   000    002 4 002  The ES algorithm maps entries to concepts in a hierarchy according the name compounding. For example drywhitewine 024F,Q:59ØG is a subclass of “whitewine  Q:59ØG and “whitewine Q:59ØG is a subclass of wine 59ØG and “wine 59ØG is subclass of alcohol G Most taxonomy relations between concepts are finding  But, the hierarchy is rough. The named rule is not fit for every entry. So, some entries are put on a wrong position. For example, “red_ alcohol 4vG is a sibling concept of “wine 59ØG in the hierarchy. In the fact red_ alcohol 4vG is a shortened form of “redwine 4v 59ØG It is a child concept of “wine 59ØG Another entry name is rooted in pronounce of its foreign name. for example “PinotNoir T¥\012•A It is a type of grape. There is not information about the grape in the entry name  3.2. Feature text \(FT\ extract  In the description, several of information is mixed together. Only the feature text, which embodies its dissimilarity with other entries, is needed. To eliminate the disturbed information, we extract the feature text from the description at first Where the FT of an entry appears In description of an entry, it contains its FT and other information, which maybe talk about the subclass entries To distinguish these subclass entries, the definitions of subclass entries are a good choice  For example, the description of “wine 59ØG  consists of the definition, the classification \(definition of redwine 4v:59ØG definition of “whitewine Q:59ØG  and so on\ the history, the taste, and the culture about the wine”. The definition is the FT of the “wine 59ØG the description of “redwine 4v:59ØG consists of the definition, the classification \(definition of “CabernetFranc  012•\004\021 definition of “CabernetSauvignon R?·4 nd so on\. The definition of “redwine 4v:59ØG which co occurrence in two description, is the FT of the redwine 4v:59ØG  To extract the FT of an object entry, we select correlative sentences in its ancestry entries at first.  The description of the ancestry entry consists of many paragraphs. If only the object entries name exists in a paragraph, all the sentences in the paragraph will be selected. If both the object entry name and other entries name exist in the same paragraph, the selected sentences range from the sentence that contains the object entry name to the sentence that contains other entry name Obviously, the similar sentence exists in both its description and its ancestry’s description is the FT of it. At the same time, the sentence is excluded from FT of its ancestry entry  We use formula \(5\ to calculate the similarity between sentences         max         2 1 2 1 2 1 s t t s t t s t s t t s s sim i i i i i i 004 004 004 005 004   002 5 002  The formula \(5\ calculates the proportion of the terms which cooccurrence in both S1 and S2   3.3. FTs similarity calculating  To eliminate the influence of the named rule of entries 002 the entry is deleted from the FT. Then, the system uses the vector model to calculate the similarity         006 006 006 006    j i j i j i FT FT FT FT FT FT sim  002 6 002  If the similarity is 1, there is a “sameas” relation between entries. For example, the “red_rose_wine 4v\*D 59ØG is same as the “rose_red_wine 59ØG

  The “dry_white_wine 024F,Q:59ØG is same as the dry_white 024F,Q But, the entries maybe locate in different place of the hierarchy. For example, the rose_red_wine 4v:59ØG is a subclass of the red_wine 4v:59ØG the “red_rose_wine 4v\:59 G is a subclass of the “wine 59ØG So, taxonomy relations must be corrected. If the similarity between FTs is larger than a threshold, they are sibling. The system locates the entry according its sibling’s location  4  Experiments The system select “wine 59ØG topic in Chinese baidu encyclopedia Wiki   t h e r e  a r e 221 e n t r i e s a b o u t  the topic. All the entries are correlated to the “wine”. There are 19 classifications in the topic. The table 1 shows the proportion of entries name that can be segment   Table 1: the proportion of entries name that can be segment 000F\000O\000D\000V\000V\000L\000I\000L\000F\000D\000W\000L\000R\000Q 000Q\000D\000P\000H\000\003\000F\000D\000Q\000\003\000E\000H 000V\000H\000J\000P\000H\000Q\000W 000W\000K\000H\000\003\000Q\000X\000P\000E\000H\000U\000\003\000R\000I 000H\000Q\000W\000U\000L\000H\000V G&\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000\014 000\026\000\023 000\026\000\031 000\033\000\026\000\021\000\026\000\026 59Ø\000\013\000J\000U\000D\000S\000H\000\014 000\033 000\025\000\024 000\026\000\033\000\021\000\024\000\023 59Ø\014Á\000\013\000J\000U\000D\000S\000H\000U\000\\\000\014 000\024\000\032 000\025\000\024 000\033\000\023\000\021\000\034\000\030 59ØG&\024X 000\025 000\025 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 007p\015\016\000\013\000I\000D\000U\000P\000\014 000\025 000\025 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 G&\014Á\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000\003 000J 000D\000U\000G\000H 000Q 000\025 000\025 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 G&KÕ\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000\003\000F\000D\000E\000L\000Q\000H 000\030 000\030 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 G&\015¢\000\003\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000\003\000W\000R\000Z\000Q\000\014 000\025 000\025 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 G&\011V\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000U\000\\\000\014 000\031 000\024\000\024 000\030\000\027\000\021\000\030\000\030 G&\035C\000\013\000Z\000L\000Q\000H\000\003\000F\000X\000S\000\014 000\025 000\025 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 007@\011Ì\000\013\000F\000R\000U\000S\000\014 000\025\000\024 000\027\000\025 000\030\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 015\004\011\016\000\013\000D\000U\000H\000D\000\014 000\025 000\026 000\031\000\031\000\021\000\031\000\032 024X\014Á\000\003\000P\000D\000Q\000R\000U 000\031\000\026 000\031\000\026 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 004{\011\016 000\027 000\027 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 000R\000W\000K\000H\000U 000\030 000\030 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023 000W\000R\000W\000D\000O 000\024\000\032\000\024 000\025\000\025\000\024 000\032\000\032\000\021\000\026\000\033   After executing the ES algorithm, we form a hierarchy The root node of the hierarchy is a virtual node-- “thing All of 19 classifications are its child nodes. We will compare this hierarchy with an expert-defined ontology that is downloaded from [11  P r eci s i o n  an d  r eca ll ar e th e n  u s ed  to evaluate the hierarchy. We defined two kinds of precision evaluation methods, as follows. classification precision demonstrates the precision of the classification which the entries belong to; location precision shows the precision of the location in the hierarchy.

Table 3 listed the relationships between expert ontology and the hierarchy corrected by calculating the FTs similarity. Based on the foregoing, the classification precision C-Precision is up to 95 LPrecision\(C_L is up to 90%, and the Recall is up to 95 The figure 3 shows a part of the wine ontology generated by system. The gray concept 012•G locate in a error location. The main reason of the error is that too fewer information can be used. None other entry is similar to the concept. So, the error generated by ES algorithm can not revise

Figure 6 and Figure 7 highlight the dead neuron areas \(oval shape line\ced by ViSOM mapping   Figure 6: ViSOM’s visualization for the 3D synthetic data set, dead neurons=68.4 MSE=0.048    Figure 7:  Weight vectors’ positioning by ViSOM for the 3D synthetic data set   AC-ViSOM network with map size 15x15 is used to perform the mapping. The normalization constant  out was set to 15 and  in value was computed over the data set. The remaining parameter settings were kept the same as the previous AC-ViSOM network applied on 2D Gaussian data set.

Figure 9 again demonstrated that, AC-ViSOM was able to nicely embed the weight vectors in the data region, resulting minimized number of dead neurons produced in the map, and lower MSE value than that of ViSOM The following section conducts a similar experiment to demonstrate AC-ViSOM in highdimensional data set  5.3.

The normalization constant  out was set to 20 and  in value was computed over the data set The remaining parameter settings were kept the same as the previous AC-ViSOM network applied on 2D Gaussian data set. AC-ViSOM’s visualization for this WBC data set was presented in Figure 11   Figure 11: AC-ViSOM’s visualization for WBC data set, dead neuron=34.5%, MSE=0.193   Figure 11 demonstrated that, AC-ViSOM was able to produce data structure preserved visualization with more active neurons in the map than that of ViSOM projected in Figure 10 for this high dimensional data set. Figure 11 also demonstrated that, AC-ViSOM was able to produce a better data representation justified by low MSE obtained compared against that of ViSOM The above experiments have shown that ACViSOM is able to produced less dead neurons for better network utilization, optimised data representation with lower MSE value, and appealing data structure preserved visualization as compared with ViSOM  6. Conclusion and future works In this paper, an extension of ViSOM was proposed by hybridising modified Adaptive Coordinate \(AC\ approach and ViSOM network as AC-ViSOM. Empirical studies have shown that, ACViSOM is able to eliminate the trial and error process of selecting suitable resolution control parameter of ViSOM. Besides, it is able to minimize the number of dead neurons in the map as well as optimise the data representation as compared with that of ViSOM. This better network utilization ability of AC-ViSOM has a potential to minimize the map size requirements to produce effective data visualization For the future works, the research will look forward to define a way of increasing AC-ViSOM inter-neuron distance preservation ability. The method on how to define a suitable initialisation process for the weight vectors to represent the data density information will also be investigated  Acknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Fundamental Research Grant Scheme 27\d Universiti Malaysia Sarawak for funding this work  7.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
