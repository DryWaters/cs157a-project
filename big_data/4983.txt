An Improved Algorithm with Key Attributes Constraints for Mining Interesting Association Rules in Network Log  Jin Kezhong  College of Physics and Electronic Information Engineering Wenzhou University Wenzhou, China jsj_jkz@wzu.edu.cn Wu chengwen College of Physics and Electronic Information Engineering Wenzhou University Wenzhou, China jsj_wcw@wzu.edu.cn   Abstract Computer logs are generated by application activities network accesses and system audit, which are important data 
sources for user pattern mining computer forensic analysis, intrusion detection analysis and outlier detection. Algorithms for mining association rule are useful methods to find interesting rules implied in large computer log data. But existing algorithms which based on confidence and support are unfit for mining computer log data, many uninteresting rules will be generated and useful rules will be shadowed. To solve this problem, the concept of key attributes of network log data is introduced, and an algorithm with key attributes constraints for mining interesting association rules in network log data is designed. Experimental result shows that the number of uninteresting rules can be reduced effectively and the validity of rules which mined are improved Keywords key attribute 
 association rule network log data mining I   I NTRODUCTION  With the rapidly development of computer technologies and widely applying of network t echnologies, tremendous amount of data is accumulated in computer applications, such as scientific data, marketing data, financial data and network log. How to efficiently analyze these data and extract patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored in data source becomes more and more important. Although simple statistical techniques and 
machine learning for data analysis were developed long ago advance techniques for intelligent data analysis are not yet mature. Data mining is a new generation of information processing technology, which is the process of extracting previously unknown and useful information from a large data source. It has been extensively applied to a wide variety of applications like sales analysis, healthcare, manufacturing, financial analysis etc. A number of studies have been made on efficient data mining methods and the relevant applications Computer log, which includes records related to whatever activities occurring on an information system. It is a greatly important data source for finding intrusion activities, computer forensic, reporting usage statuses of system resources 1 
But computer log usually is tremendous and hard to analyze by traditional methods to find useful information implied. The methods of data mining can extract interesting \(nontrivial, implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful knowledge from huge amount of data. So the methods of data mining are fit for analyzing log data to extract implicit information automatically Association rules mining can be used to find correlativity of different log records, and sequence pattern analyzing can be used to find time sequence relationship between different log records. Outlier analyzing can be used to find outlier which different from normal patterns II  P ROBLEM S 
TATEMENTS  A  Association Rule Mining Among the data mining methods, association rules discovery might be the most studied one. It was introduced by R Agrawal and his partners 2-4 Given a set of transactions, where each transaction is a set of items, an association rule is expressed as XY   where X and Y are sets of items. The intuitive meaning of such a rule is that transactions of the data source which contain X  
tend to contain Y An example of an association rule is: ç25 of transactions that contain beer also contain diapers; 5% of all transactions contain both itemsé. Here, 25% is called the confidence of the rule, and 5% is the support of the rule The procedure of mining association rules can be decomposed into two sub steps First, find all combination of items whose support is greater than minimum_support Call these combination frequent item sets Second, use the frequent item sets to generate the desired rules. The general idea is that, if ABCD and AB 
are frequent item sets, then we can determine whether the rule  A BCD   holds by computing the ratio   r support ABCD support AB  1 The rule holds only if ___________________________________ 978-161284 109-0 11 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE  


_ r minimum confidence  2 Most existing works focus on finding the association rules among all items in the database that satisfy user-specified minimum_confidence and support To reduce the number of frequent item sets and times of database scanning, some algorithms 5-8 are also proposed, such as AIS, SETM, PARTITION FUP, Max-Miner, FUFIA, etc. But to the first sub step, Apriori 2 is still used to generate candidate item sets B  Drawback of Apriori in Network Log Mining In practice, people are often interested in finding association rules include only some specified items rather than all items in a query. Meanwhile, based on the search results in former queries, we need to change the minimum confidence  and support to obtain suitable number of rules. So we tend to make several consecutive queries with different interested items, minimum confidence and support for potential rules After the rules set is generated, pe ople have to identify the interesting rules from the large rules include many uninteresting rules In network log mining, because records of log may has many different items and the or iginal data source is very large using the existing association rule mining algorithms will have the following drawbacks First, many irrelevant or uninteresting rules will be generated. For example, we choice network log data as the data source to mining association rules. In a log record, some fields such as protocol, source destination, src_port, dest_port src_bytes, dest_bytes, state and flag are included, shown as in Table I. When using Aproiri to mine association rules, we find some rules such as _ 200 s rc bytes flag SF   in the results. But as we know, the number of bytes of a host send to the destination is irrelevant to network connection flag, so it is an uninteresting rule. In this scenario, we get a lot of association rules for all item sets in only partial of which we are really interested. These uninteresting rules will puzzle log analyzers Second, for generating the candidate frequent item sets, the whole log database and all items of log records need to be scanned several times. Itês very inefficient in considering the big overhead of reading the large database even though only partial items are interesting. In practice, the weight of different fields of log record is different, itês not necessary to scan all fields several times  TABLE I N ETWORK L OG R ECORD  field value protocol ftp-data source 18 destination 129.7.1.9 src_port 22 dest_port 45213 src_bytes 212 dest_bytes 0 state SF flag L Considering these drawbacks described above, we present an improved association rule mining algorithm that can efficiently discover the more interesting association rules involving specified fields of record III  T HE D EFINITION OF K EY A TTRIBUTE  Records of log usually are composed with some different fields. These fields, such as time stamp, source and destination IP address, port number and other information, express the different information about computer system status or network connection. The weight of different field in record is different Some fields are key attributes of log records, and other fields are auxiliary. In the network log, every record represents a network connection, which includes some fields shown as in Table I. But as we know, not all the fields are important to describe a network connection activity. In fact, we can describe a network connection by five-tuples, denote as   destPort srcPort destIP srcIP timestamp      We call these fields included in five-tuples as key attributes 9  Definition 1 let     2 1 n u u u U  be a set of attributes which included in a log record F is the set of functional dependency between different fields. For any subset U K  if U  is completely functional dependent on K we call K is the set of key attribute, for any K k   k is a key attribute So, we can use the key attribute to estimate whether an association rule is interestin g or not. The estimation expressed as A    Ir fIrsrcr  3 In this expression s\(r is the minimum support of association rule r  c\(r is the minimum confidence 1 if  rule includes key attributes 0 otherwise A r I    012 4 When a generated rule satisfies s\(r  c\(r and I A r itês I A  1, we regard it as an interesting rule. Otherwise it will be discarded IV  A LGORITHM WITH K EY A TTRIBUTES C ONSTRAINTS  According to the definition of key attribute, an Improved Algorithm with Key attribute Constraints \(IAKC\signed for mining interesting rules in log data. This algorithm tends to mine association rules no t only constrained with minimum_confidence and support but also constrained with the set of key attributes. It means when a new rule is generated, it will contain at least one key attribute, those rules without any key attribute, which usually is an uninteresting rule, will be excluded from the result Algorithm: IAKC Input: log database D the set of key attribute K  minimum_confidence  c  minimum_support s  Output: the set of rules include key attribute

The data source  is log data that activities of network connections between Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and Internet during thirty days are recorded We choice protocol, local host , remote host, src_port and dest_port as the set of key attribute, then running two algorithms with minimum confidence as 95% and minimum support as 1%, 5% and10%. The result is shown as Figure 1 Under the fixed minimum_confidence, with the decline of minimum_support, the number of rules generated by Aproiri is increased fast, but the number of rules generated by the improved algorithm with key attribute constraints is increased smoothly. In log mining, the source data is so large and every log record is in same format, many rules will be generated in association rule mining. But in the work of log analysis, interesting key information is what we needed, not a large rules set      Figure 1.  Performance Evaluation of Rule Number  On the contrary, more rules will submerge the useful information. When mining association rules with key attribute constraints, every rule generated by IAKC will include at least one key attribute, it will help worker analyze log more efficiently Analyzing the rule set, we find that many rules are generated by Apriori, but there are many uninteresting rule with the items of state, flag, and bytes send, such as 12 s tate SF source flag L   These rules are helpless to log an alyzing. In rule set generated by IAKC, the total number of rule is less than Apriori But we find every rule incl udes key attribute, it indicates the relevance between the different attribute. For example, an interesting rule is shown as below protocol=telnet,destination=192.35.222.222 source=12  It shows that between host 12 and remote host, which IP address is 192.35.222.222, telnet service occurs frequently. In the original data, we find there are many log records about the telnet service between these two hosts The result of performance evaluation shows that the improved algorithm with key attribute constraints can find more interesting association rules in log data and can help researcher analyze log more efficiently Because with the key attributes constraints, the number of frequent item sets are reduced, and times to scan database also decreased. The result of performance evaluation is shown as Figure 2. The time consumption of algorithm with key attributes constraints is less than Aproiri. This is very important when the algorithm applied to network log analysis, because the data source is very large VI  C ONCLUSION  The purpose of network log mining is to find interesting information implied in the tremendous number of log data. The validity of rule and time consumption are two important factor to algorithm when it is applied in network log analysis. In this paper, we analyze methods of association rule mining in log data, define key attributes set of network log, then we present an improved algorithm with key attribute constraints to mine more interesting rules. The result of performance evaluation shows the efficiency of this algorithm, not only the number of rules is reduced and the validity of rules is improved, but also time consumption is decreased            Figure 2.

If we only want capture IPv6 packet, we can be set to "ip6 The Libpcap capture packet based on BPF filters, and its designed in order to user-level programs enable to high efficient access the original untreated network data packets Libpcap only supports BPF interface kernel filter, without the support of BPF, all data packets will be read into the user space B. Association Rule Mining Association rule discovery, the area being studied most actively technique to investigate the possibility of simultaneous occurrence of the data. Let I={i1,i2,,im} be a set of literals, called items. Let D be a set of transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that T?I. An association rule is an implication of the form X?Y, where X I,Y ? I,X ? Y=?. Support and confidence are used to describe the interestingness or goodnessof a rule as follows support\(X?Y X?Y confidence\(X?Y X|Y Original network data Data Analysis Pretreatment Pattern mining library Pattern comparison Current network data Output Data Analysis Pretreatment 385 or confidence\(X?Y X?Y X The support of the rule X ? Y is proportion of transactions in D that contain X?Y. The confidence of the association rule X ? Y is the proportion of transactions including both X and Y to all the transactions that association that may happen only among the data that satisfy the minimum support and minimum confidence set by the users. All item sets that have support greater than or equal to the user specified minimum support are generated C. Construction of the candidate feature attribute There is a variety of attribute values in captured network data packets, The basic property is {DIP, DPort Flag, Protocol, Service, State} by extract from the original 


network data. A variety of attacks against the network, its target usually is a host or a service. Thus, the system will serve type and destination host IP as the primary attribute other attributes as a reference attribute. At the same time account the correlation between network attack and time, the system uses the statistical properties of time window. Early experimental result shows \(Lee 1998 detection port or denial of service attacks, etc., usually the time window in 30s completed. At this time the network state almost stabilized. Therefore, in order to increase the main attributes impact to the pattern mining, to improve the accuracy of intrusion detection. The system constructs timerelated primary attribute, its time window is 30s. Table 1 Property Name Meaning Host_count In a time window within the target host with the current connection records number of same connect Same_srv_rate At the same destination host its same connect to service destination port rate Diff_srv_rate At the same destination host its different connect to service destination port rate Same_srv_count At the same destination host its same connect to Service Destination Port with currently connected number Srv_diff_host_rate At the same service?its different connect to destination host rate TABLE I.  CANDIDATE TIME RELEVANT ATTRIBUTES In this way, the system have 11 properties by captured data packets and extract the properties D. Data Preprocessing In association rule mining based on rough set theory the rough set theory mainly used in the pretreatment to conditions attribute data, Data padded and numerical attributes discrete. The experimental data of missing values is very few, so we used it by direct deletion. Discretization of numerical attributes we use Semi Native Scaler algorithm for discrete. The specific algorithm as follows 


To each attribute value a?A, make breakpoint set Ca do the following 1 makes the adjacent objects xi?xi+1 follow vai?vai+1, vai vai+1?Va 2 number frequency to a collection of decision-making value in the corresponding decision-making be calculated Di?Di+1 Di={v?Vd| v=arg maxv|{x?[xi] a|d\(x Di+1={v?Vd| v=arg maxv|{x?[xj] a|d\(x 3 Di?Di+1 Di+1?Di then Ca= Ca?{\(vai+ vai+1 VI. IMPROVE ALGORITHM We can solve the associate rule mining problem in two steps 1 database D 2 frequent itemsets The first step is the most difficult in the mining process After discovering all the frequent itemsets, it is easy to computer the relative association rules. Algorithm Apriori is the most effective among these mining algorithms. The algorithm be shown as follows Step0. Scan the database D to find out L1 Step1. Ck, k>1, is generated by joining the itemsets in Lk1. The itemsets in Ck which have some\(k-1 in Lk-1 are deleted Step2. The support of itemsets in Ck is calculated through database scan to decide Lk Step3. Go to step 1 until Lk The algorithms implement a method that extracts frequent items through scanning the transactional database repeatedly. However, the spending for scanning the database is so lavish that the efficiency of the algorithm databases Therefore, we take the interestingness into account and improve on the basic algorithm In the practical application of association rules sometimes excavated in the rules contains some do not want to get attributes. For example, this rule is derived: "IP address ? MAC address" or the "Service \(HTTP 


80 386 complexity of derivation; Increase the size of the pattern library; affecting the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection. In order to improve efficiency of the algorithm association rules to restrict the premise and conclusion in appear properties \(set allowed appearing decision-making attributes and their corresponding values, other attributes only allowed appearing in the premise of rules. As this way, association rule is to be effective rules VII. PATTERN COMPARISON In the pattern comparison, after the pre-recorded the network connection records as the user's current mode. These connection records in rule library are called as historical pattern. Intrusion detection process is the process of model comparison. In the pattern comparison, we introduce the concept of similarity level characterized the degree of accord different behavior patterns. Similarity values range from [0 1], the higher the value explain the greater the similarity, that is, own the greater possibility of abnormal Using Similarity comparison algorithm, in the first we assume X and Y represent the connection records as you want to compare, X\(i records \(0?i+k?Length\(Y i?k is results of the comparison for X\(i i+k is described as follows F=Max[F\(k Y Which, F\(k i,k X Y The greater the results of comparison, the greater link records similarity. In this system, if set F is greater than 0.7 we would considered as abnormal behavior VIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS A. Experimental Design For experimenting purposes at the Institute of Computer Network, a small IPv6 network has been established. The network consists of five computer. All computers have been configured as dual-boot configurations driven by MS Windows XP \(with SP2 included systems. Also, all computers in the experimental network have been configured as dual-stack devices supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols 


In the described experimental network some IPv6 intrusion detection tests have been done. Different types of DoS attacks have been performed. Through continuous monitor network streams data in 18 hours, we get the intrusion behavior and some normal connections. Much real streams data are also been performed upon this model Experimental results and some possibilities for their successful detection will be analyzed in next subsection B. Testing Result Tests in Table 2 are done with testing data set. In order to find the relationship between detection accuracy and minimum supports with the same attributes, experiments are done with data of different minimum supports.

An improved association rule discovering system under IPv6 network has been studied in this paper. We improved the base Apriori algorithm, this makes association rule mining techniques applicable to IPv6 network, and achieved good experimental results After analysis of experimental results found, although data mining-based intrusion detection model has advantages in the detection performance and universal, however, the systems still exist the following difficulties 1 detection method than the traditional detect has higher false detection rate 2 training data, and more complexity than traditional systems ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This paper is part of the project supported by Stadholder Foundation of Guizhou Province \(Grant No.2007\(14 Graduate Innovation Fund of Guozhou University: Research key technologies of network management in IPv6 network environment \(Grant No.2010006 express his appreciation to the supporter REFERENCES 1] RFC 2375: IPv6 Multicast Address Assignments 2] RFC 2460: Internet Protocol, Version 6 \(IPv6 3] RFC 2463: Internet Control Message Protocol \(ICMPv6 Specification 4] Bishop, M., Cheung, S., Wee, C., Frank, J., Hoagland, J., Samorodin S.: The Threat from the Net.

The model with lesser nr but generates good acc is better than model that use more rule to generate same result [12]. Table VI shows the rule classification of the best model.

The rule sample of the excellent and weak group From the analysis on the generated rules, it shows that student with programming experience before enter the university has benefit to score the programming subject However, some rules indicate that the programming background is not guarantee the student can score programming well. The result was similar to [7, 10, 11].  In line with many literatures, gender plays important role when male is performed better than female. Furthermore, rough set analysis found that student can score programming well with only the average grade in Mathematic and English during SPM at least at grade C subject might face difficulties in learning programming Additionally, another finding which is contradict with previous study is the majority of excel group student has good grade in Malay Language \(at least B grade program that needs student to enroll programming subject, all programs have similar chances to score the subject The relationship between personality factors towards programming grades was also investigated.  Out of 3003 rules of excellent group, there are 2184 rules which describe the personality test result.  We further investigated all rules and from the analysis, many students with investigative type and average cognitive ability have ability to excel programming The findings were similar to [7, 11]. Interestingly, rough set also identified that the social type student also can do programming well. From the literature, a social type is an emphatic, warm, kind, patient and helpful person as well as prefers to teach and help others. Figure 6 summarizes the rule analysis of personality test of the excellent group. The figure shows that the highest score of the investigative type student C11-C20 and C21-C32 social type student. Based on Holland the theory, it is not suggested the personality of student must fall into one the six categories, but rather are composed of one each of the six 


personality orientation. Generally, the Investigative, Artistic and Social are expected to associate together and less of the characteristic associated with Realistic, Enterprising, or conventional personality type [18  Figure 6.

CONCLUSION In this paper, a dataset of undergraduate student from Faculty of IT, UUM was mined using rough set technique Formerly, there were several researches had mined the data using statistic, clustering, and association rule. This study was aimed to identify another unique characteristic that influence student programming grade using other data analysis method The study indicates that student prior experience in programming before university can contributes to a good grade but it is not guarantee that they can easily score the subject The study also reveals that average grades in Mathematic English, and Malay language during SPM also can influence the final grade. Moreover, male student performance is looked better than female.  In term of personality factor, the investigative and social type plus average cognitive person are found as important factors that influence programming.  This finding can be a guideline for the faculty to plan teaching and learning program for new registered student  REFERENCES  1] Z.H.Khan.
