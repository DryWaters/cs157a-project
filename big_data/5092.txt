Patient can communicate with doctor and can be real-timely monitored at home through some simple medical terminals with several vital sensors located at home, those terminals connect with hospital monitoring center via internet, and data will be real-timely acquired and compressed, continuously transmitted to a hospital monitoring center 1 Many problems are solved with it, such as it is expensive and inconvenient for patients to seeing a doctor 2 and hospital can not afford the service to patients in time as there are too many patients 3 etc Long-term and continuous monitoring should be offered in order to provide exact cure to patients in time. However there must be a large number of data in the server as a result of the long-term and continuous monitoring 4 and it is inconvenient for physician and specialists to diagnose because of those data. Thus, it is urgent to extract the implicit, the unknown, the potential, the deeper and the valuable information from those large data to support specialists to make decision For the purpose, the technology of data mining  was applied in this article to analyze and deal with a large number of data, so that healthcare experts can provide more accurate information for patients from a newer, higher and more comprehensive perspective. And the home health telemonitoring system based on data mining was put forward, realizing specialist consultation of care through computer at home using the technology of data mining which can extract the connotative and valuable information automatically. The system was set up in java, and client/server model  was adopted. The monitoring center and the terminals were connected with javasocket, and the server can answer many requests of client terminals and realtimely receive monitoring data. The client terminals can deal with the data received from the sensors and have the capabilities of real-time display, print, save and review. Data and alarm signals were transmitted to a hospital monitoring center from clients via internet, simultaneously, all received data in the hospital are instantly displayed on the central monitor screen and recorded into the knowledge 7 generated through the data mining techniques, and responses to the alarm and gives the care advice to the patient II  D ATA MINING  As the monitoring system faced the confusion of “marine data 8 how to handle a large amount of data and use them effectively, namely extracting the knowledge hidden in the data through analyzing the relationship between the data has becoming the focus research for people who are undertaking the information technology. Data mining technologies have emerged under the circumstance. Data mining is the process of extracting the implicit, unknown previously, and valuable knowledge and rules from vast, incomplete, noise ambiguous and the practical application of random data These rules imply the specific relations between the objects in the database, find a number of useful information, thus it overcame the bottleneck of acquiring knowledge. Specialists and physicians can identify those valuable rules and knowledge hidden in amount of data through data mining By analyzing the rules and knowledge, they will have a better understanding of their illness, and provide more accurate knowledge of care. There are many algorithms of data mining, for instance, rough set theory, artificial neural networks, decision trees, genetic algorithms and association rules, etc A  Process of Data Mining Implicit and valuable information can be found from vast data using data mining techniques. First establishing characteristic database of monitoring by pretreating and extracting the monitoring data according to the monitoring data drew from the cases of elder people suffering from different diseases with different sensors and the relevant 2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application 978-0-7695-3600-2/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.199 431 2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application 978-0-7695-3600-2/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.199 431 2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application 978-0-7695-3600-2/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.199 431 2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application 978-0-7695-3600-2/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.199 431 2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application 978-0-7695-3600-2/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.199 431 2009 International Forum on Information Technology and Application 978-0-7695-3600-2/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/IFITA.2009.199 431

medical explanations provided by hospital. Data mining is an optimizing process of the target and data. Figure 1 shows the process of data mining      Figure 1  The process of data mining The steps of data mining are as follows 1\ Data extracting: Extracting the relevant data according to the raw data character 2\  Data pretreatment: Data pretreatment is the process of operating the data further more. After disposed, the data has the standard format and it can be provided for the later mining. The main tasks of pretreatment are data cleaning and data options etc. The data in the database are not all correct The dirty data we called are half-baked, variance, imprecise and repeated, and they all need to be cleaned before they are loaded to the data warehouse. The first step is the noise data should be cleaned, the next step is rules and method of selecting data should be decided according to the mode, thus we can select the data which meet the request of the mode And the format of the data will be transformed if necessary 3\ Data mining and knowledge base: Data mining is the process of extracting data and forming knowledge among the normative target data congregate according to the specific model and algorithms. To achieving the knowledge mode which can meet the command of users’ at last, it should have the support of knowledge base to communicate with users using the gained data again and again. The gained knowledge through mining is to be stored in knowledge base. That knowledge has different abstract arrangement and it can be applied to analyze data and make decision at different decision-making phase III  SYSTEM COMPONENTS  A  System Framework The system has formed the monitoring network based on network, and it can monitor many physiological parameters including pulse, electrocardiogram, blood pressure temperature etc. It also has the functions of monitoring curing in time, analyzing the state of illness and so on meanwhile it also can execute the consultation on line between patient and doctor. Figure 2 shows the total structure of the telemonitoring system This system is mainly composed of two separate parts, a healthcare server and the client terminals. The main tasks of the client terminals are collecting the data of the pulse temperature etc, and then amplifying them, A/D transforming, compressing and packing them and so on While the server’s main tasks are analyzing the data and managing them. The server which is at the monitoring center of a hospital or specialists’ area of home healthcare can realtimely receive and display the characteristic information coming from the terminals, and it will also analyze the signals and return the result to patient. The client that is at the terminal will take charge of measuring the data of users collecting, and dealing with the data for the first time, and it can communicate with the server via internet, it was made of portable computer and a care bed  which can collect all kinds of physiological parameters The principle of the system is as follows: collecting information of patients through the function modules of blood pressure, pulse, temperature etc. The received data will be disposed by the monitoring equipments and displayed at terminal and also transmitted to the server via internet. After receiving the data, the server will real-timely display the data and store them in the database, then the mining system will clean, transform and eliminate the “noise data” and constitute data warehouse through the data mining technologies, at the same time, it will produce rules and knowledge and establish knowledge base by distilling the useful information. Thus doctor will answer the alarm signals and feed back the doctor’s advice to the patient by obtaining the connotative and valuable knowledge from the knowledge base    Figure 2  Total structure of monitoring system based on data mining B  the Detail Module of the System The server will real-timely analyze and display the ECG temperature and pulse waveform after receiving the data from the client terminals. Specialists may analyze the state of an illness according to the real-time waveform and data displayed, the system also has the functions of saving and  Home health telemonitorin g s y stem Manage users S y stem maintenance Displa y alarms Telemonitoring and alternate dia g nose Display the info and monitorin g data of p atients User registering Query, modify or delete user informatio n  Nurse advices W ave reviewin g Diagnose results Wave analyzing Manage the monitoring data of users Manage database and knowled g e base Wave observation Diagnose except ional wave  Figure 3  The function modules of the monitoring center  Database Extracting Pretreatment Algorithm of data mining Knowledge b ase 432 432 432 432 432 432

printing. The server not only can receive information coming from the terminal devices, but also can send the diagnostic results to the client terminals. The software of monitoring center has been divided into five subsystems, and Figure 3 shows the functions in detail IV  SYSTEM IMPLEMENT AND ITS KEY TECHNOLOGIES  A  System Implement The system is programmed based on Windows 2003 using java language, and its database is SQL Server 2000. It has many good characteristics including friendly interface expansible and security etc. The system homepage is divided into four parts, each part displays different monitoring object, and each part will be zoomed out when you want to see the sub-interface more detail B  the Transfer of Monitoring Data The transmitting of the monitoring data is crucial to whole of the remote monitoring system. At the terminal intelligent monitoring terminals monitor patient and send the physiological parameters to the corresponding modules to make them converted to digital signals, and then save them through serial interface, and waveform will be given after dealing with received data such as pulse, blood pressure and temperature, and meanwhile the data will be sent to the monitoring center, which is the core of the whole system and its main functions are receiving, disposing and saving physiological parameters coming from home users displaying the physiological parameters of user who is realtimely connected with the server, helping doctor make decision. And the server has also the functions of analyzing the illness automatically, accounting the illness and storing the classified data In the system, Client and Server are connected with Socket, and data are exchanged through TCP/IP, the communication program at the server is implemented based on Socket under Java2 platform. There sets one monitoring port at the server and transfers the method of listening, and the method of accepting will be adopted when client terminals want to connect with the server. The server is at the state of waiting when the computer is starting, and responding to the client terminals at any time. When the system is running, the server starts first, and monitors the appointed port. The server agrees and founds connecting when home terminal puts forward the request of connecting After finishing it, the server and the client terminals will communicate with each other freely C  Implement of Answering Alarm with Data Mining In fact, the process of answering alarm is the process of applying iatrical knowledge. The main algorithm used in the system is associated rules, it is an applied technique of data mining, it will find useful associated knowledge from a large number of data including pulse, blood pressure and temperature, and thus the cause of disease of patient will be given by using the acquired knowledge. An association rules can be translated into two parameters: supporting\(s %\ and credibility \(c %\. Here we will take the hypertension for example, to analyze the potential therapy for patient. Table shows the solutions of the hypertension TABLE I  SOLUTIONS OF HYPERTENSION  Number Solutions of Curing Hypertension 1  Take medicine on time, Improve on food Change habitation, Enough sleeping 2  Change habitation, Appropriate sports  3  Take medicine on time, Improve on food Appropriate sports  4  Improve on food, Appropriate sports  5  Take medicine on time, Improve on food, Enough sleeping  The algorithm of association rules are used on the data in the table, the detail is as follows: first working out L1 namely gather of frequent 1 item\e results of L1 are take medicine on time, improve on food, change habitation enough sleeping and appropriate sports. The next step is working out L2 \(namely gather of frequent 2 items\, the results of L2 are{\(take medicine on time, improve on food take medicine on time, enough sleeping\, \(improve on food appropriate sports\ \(improve on food, enough sleeping The following step is working out L3 \(namely gather of frequent 3 items\, the result is L3 the algorithm stops here. Thus supporting\(s %\ will be given. The supporting\(s of L1 are as follows: \(take medicine on time, 60 improve on food, 80%\, \(Change habitation, 40%\, \(enough sleeping, 40%\ \(appropriate sports, 60%\. The L2’s are take medicine on time, improve on food, 60%\, \(take medicine on time, enough sleeping, 40%\, \(improve on food appropriate sports, 40%\ \(improve on food, enough sleeping, 40%\. According to these, we will get a lot connotative knowledge as follows   Appropriate sports improve on food s=40 c=40/ 60=66.67   Take medicine on time improve on food s=60 c=60/ 60=100   Improve on food take medicine on time s=60 c=60/ 80=75 Taking the first rule for example, it shows that 66.67 percent of the patients who take part in appropriate sports may pay attention to improving on food. Other rules can also show other different results. Medical experts and doctors can answer the alarm signals exactly according to these rules or knowledge V  CONCLUSIONS  Home health telemonitoring system based on data mining has been put forward in the paper, and the whole structure and functions of the system have also been given. Later some key technologies are presented. The system can real-timely connect with many client terminals and monitor patients for a long term. With it, many problems hardly to analyze and predict are resolved, and reliable data has been offered. Thus it will facilitate specialists to make exact judgment. The next step is to optimize the algorithms and make the system more perfect A CKNOWLEDGMENT

When the frequency itemsets in k level are found, we use dual cycle to matching mine the two itemsets in k 1 level from small to large. The generated items included by the frequency sets sort ascending and then the large itemset L k in k level will sort ascending Theory 3 For nonempty itemset X and Y the number of both X.set and Y.set s items is m and X Y  X.Set   X.Set    X.Set  m  Y.Set 1  Y.Set 2 Y.Set  m  If the sam e  ite m   is deleted from \(or inserted into X and Y simultaneously obtaining X and Y the size relationship of X and Y  is the same as the size relationship of X and Y  4.2 Data structure The core data structure of the algorithm is a multi dimensional list. The vertical list stores the frequency set nodes. Each node includes X.Set X.SupTidSet X.Sup X.Level X.NearOffspring The horizontal list consists of queues pointed by each frequency set node’s NearOffspring each node of which store a pointer pointing to a proper sub frequency set node of X.Set These pointers re-point to frequency set in the vertical list and the node store three fields Rules-Route Off-Set and Con-Set  Rules-Route is a path pointer, generating rule s. When mining rules, we depend on breadth-first search to expand the queue to deduce all the rules Off-Set stores extra items that proper sub frequency set Y is bigger than current frequency set X  Con-Set stores rule’s consequent of association rules, namely the conclusion part. The major structure of the list is shown in Figure 2 Where L 1,1 L 1,2 L 1,m L 2,1 L 2,2 L 2,n L 3,1 L 3 represents respectively frequency set node from each level, composing vertical queue X  expresses the pointer pointing to node X    Figure 2. The Structure of Multi Dimensional List The feature of data structure is that each frequency set node is adjacent to its proper sub frequency itemset sequence, and through the widely used list operation, breadth-first sear ch, we can conveniently get all the child frequency set of any a frequency set As breadth-first search is used, the obtained child frequency set sequence has been arranged as from low to high level, of which we can make use to increase the efficiency of algorithm in the course of algorithm design 4.3 Algorithm description Let Tid number of a record in database be unique in the whole database and the records in database sort ascending as Tid In this condition, the algorithm EARS can be parted into three steps Step1 By scanning database once, it generates all the order frequency set L 1 and X.SupTidSet and X.Sup  are recorded. If we set minsup to 0.5, the process of L 1 s generation is shown as table 1 and table 2  Step 2 By multiple cycles based on L 1 it generates all the large itemset L k in level k k 2

For any two frequency sets L k-1,m and L k-1,n  m<n  k-1 if the conditions are satisfied that L k-1,m 1 L k-1,n 1 L k-1,m   L k-1,n 2 L k-1,m k-2 L k-1,n kL k-1,m k L k-1,n k-1 X.Set=L k-1 m.Set  L k-1 n.Set  is respectively a k itemset According to theory 1, there is X.SupTidSet L k-1,m SupTidSet L k-1,n SupTidSet  If X.Sup minsup D in which X.Sup belongs to k itemset X  X is frequency set in level k otherwise X is a weak itemset  We can use theory 2 to accelerate dual cycle scanning for this process For any a frequency in level k, it can be obtained by matching the least two frequency sets in level k 1 consisting of k 1 elements from L k,x namely L k-1,m  L k-1,1 L k-1,2  L k-1,k-3 L k-1,k-2 and L k-1,n  L k-1,1 L k-1,2  L k-1,k-3 L k-1,k-1  When deducing frequen cy set in level k if the first k 2 items of L k-1, m and L k-1,n are different, the smaller frequency needn’t to match the following other frequency sets, in other words, the inner cycle can be stopped. After deducing a frequency set L k,x by using L k-1,m and L k-1,n  m<n  L k,x is added into the vertical list and the support set and support number of L k,x are written into corresponding domain. The pointer node pointing to L k,x is added into the proper sub nodes sequences pointed by respective NearOffspring of frequency L k-1,m and L k-1,n  and the item obtained from L k,x L k-1,m  is recorded into the off-set domain of proper sub node newly added into L k-1,m meanwhile, the item obtained from L k,x L k-1,n  is recorded into the off-set domain of proper sub node newly added into L k-1,n It searches the frequency sets which also regard L k,x as its proper sub frequency set in the frequency sets sequence at level k-1 after L k-1,n Table 3 describes the storage structure of mu ltiple list generated by example1 through step2  Table 3. The Storage Structure of Ultiple List Generated By Example  L X. Sup X. SupTidSet X.

In other words, it regards any a frequency set in vertical list as the antecedent  of association rules, and then mines out the conclusion meeting minconf, namely the rule’s consequent. When frequency set X is a rule’s antecedent, first, the next pointer of each node in NearOffspring is copied into Rules-Route pointer of current node and the value of Off-Set is copied into Con-Set forming an initial Rules-Route which generates rules. Through scanning this list to get a node, the Con-Set value Y of this node is the rule’s consequent and the support of corresponding frequency set Z can be obtained from the pointer of this node, in which according to the generation process, we know that Z=X Y If confidence X Y   Z.Sup  X.Sup  minconf it is a strong rule meeting the requirement, otherwise, it’s a weak rule. If confidence X Y a weak rule apparently the child nodes of Z don’t combine with X to generate a strong ru le. Otherwise, the NearOffspring list of Z is scanned. If it is not null each node in the list is fetched one by one and Y is copied into the Con-Set domain of the node in the list Simultaneously, the item of Off-Set domain is inserted into Con-Set making the item of Con-Set  sort ascending to form rule’s consequent M  


 Comparing M with rule’s consequent N of the last node in Rules-Route if N  M or N  M and N  M Theory 3\node will be linked to the end of Rules-Route Scan the next node of Rules-Route and repeat the above pro cess until to the last node. When example 1 uses frequency set c as rule’s antecedent Table 4 lists the Rules-Route queue and its corresponding association rules generated by the derivations. As long as the minconf is given, it could judge which are the strong rules meeting the requirement  Table 4.

The results and analysis of experiment   To verify the efficiency of EARS’s expansion function in searching and retrieval, we test on a computer with CPU 2.4 G, Memory 2GB and Windows XP operating system. The original documents are from the TREC-7 document set downloaded from the Internet, including 23251 documents. Choosing ten thousand words as feature word, the documents are carried on the feature extraction and word frequency counting, forming word frequency matrix stored in the Oracle9i database. When minsup 0.04 minconf 0.4, the number of records in the database increases from 2,000 to 10,000 and the execute efficiency of EARS and Apriori is shown as Figure 3.From Figure 3, we can see that as records increasing, both of the runtime are prone to increase, while, from the perspective of data, the increment speed of EARS’ runtime is slower than Apriori’s. In addition, the runtime of EARS is less than Apriori’s at any time                        Theoretically speaking  EARS scans the database once only when discovering the large 1-itemset in the whole process of mining, whic h solves the problem about the heavy load of I/O With the help of Tid sets recorded in the memory the algorithm doesn’t generate candidate large itemset C k  The advantage of using the data structure multiple dimensional po inters, is that when generating association rules, the expenditure of matching time is decreased as much as possible by making the best use of previous work  The design of the algorithm makes use of the ordered data structure and set operations Therefore, the execute efficiency of EARS is improved effectively 6. Conclusion In the current developing process of network search engine technology, how to using web data mining technology is a ke y point. In the research process of the web search engine technology, this paper analyses in depth on the query expansion technology based on the association rules. We propose an association rul es mining algorithm EARS based on multiple dimensional list. The results of experiment indicate that the efficiency of EARS is higher than Apriori’s and the runtime of EARS varies within a small range, namely having a good flexibility. It thus is concluded that EARS is an effective and scalable association rules algorithm which can be widely used to query expansion in web information retrieval
