France fu,mephu} @cril.univ-artois.fr Abstract Mining frequent closed itemsets is one effective method to analyse frequent pattern, and further, to generate asso  ciation rules. Several algorithms were proposed to gener  ate frequent closed itemsets, including CLOSE, A-CLOSE CLOSET, CHARM and CLOSET + etc. However it's still hard for these algorithms to deal with dense and very large data In this paper, we analyze the search space of frequent closed itemsets and propose a new decomposition algo  rithm for mining frequent closed itemsets called PFC. PFC can dynamically generate non-overlapping partitions of the search space and mine frequent closed itemsets in each par  tition. Furthermore, each partition is independent and only shares the same source data with other partitions. So it is possible to implement PFC with multi-threads or paral  lel methods, and prune efficiently the search space of fre  quent closed itemsets. In this study, P FC is implemented in Java. We compare PFC with an author's C++ version of CLOSET + on some large VCI repository datasets and on the worst case. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate good performance of PFC for dealing with dense and very large data 1 Introduction Association rule mining [1] is an important mining task that consists in searching all frequent item sets among trans  actions composed of data attributes. Many algorithms are proposed for discovering association rules from database But these algorithms usually suffer from the complexity of mining large or dense databases. We know that it generates a very large number of frequent itemsets and rules to mine association rules. Some research works [10] have focused on developing efficient algorithms based on closed itemsets in order to prune the search space or estimate the complex  ity of the mining task Closed itemsets theory relies on concept lattice theory mainly known as Formal Concept Analysis \(FCA  Concept lattice structure has shown to be an effective tool for data analysis and knowledge discovery [9], and more especially for finding frequent closed item sets for association rules [10, 11, 12, 13]. It can generate formal concepts from the data to reveal the relations between objects and attributes. The concept lattice can be graphi  cally represented as conceptual hierarchies, allowing the analysis of complex structures. A formal concept \(or concept transactions attributes and extents. In the context of association rule mining, all frequent itemsets are uniquely determined by the set of frequent closed itemsets. The problem of finding frequent itemsets from data for association rules can be reduced to finding frequent closed itemsets with closed itemset lattice And it's possible to prune the number of rules produced without information loss using closed itemset lattice [10 For example, considering a database that contains three transactions 01 \(al' a2, ... ,a50 al' a2, ... , aSO 03 \(al' a2, ... , alOo is 2, a frequent closed itemsets mining will generate only two frequent closed itemsets: \(al' a2, ... , a5o al' a2, ... , aso frequent closed itemsets In recent years, extensive studies have proposed fast algorithms for mining frequent closed itemsets, such as CLOSE, A-close [10], CLOSET [11], CHARM[13] and 


CLOSE, A-close [10], CLOSET [11], CHARM[13] and CLOSET + [12], free-sets [3] etc. The recent work of Wang and colleagues [12] shows CLOSET+ is one of the best al  gorithms for mining frequent closed itemsets. CLOSET have good performance for sparse data. However, when the data is dense or the size of items is large, it has different performance even if the minimal support threshold is high All these algorithms are based on previous designs of al  gorithms to generate frequent itemsets, like Apriori [2], FP  growth [7], etc ... They aren't linked to previous reported algorithms that generate formal concepts [8]. In their ex  perimental work, Kuznetsov and Obiedkov [8] have demon  strated the potential of Ganter's algorithm \(NextClosure and in a recent work Fu and Mephu [5] have shown that Ganter's algorithm is one of the best when dealing with dense datasets. Fu and Mephu have extended this algorithm in order to deal with large data. By using a "divide-and  conquer" strategy, they proposed a new algorithm called ScalingN extClosure [4] that creates different partitions of the search space and allows to deal with huge and dense data In the present work we design a new algorithm to generate frequent closed itemsets, that is based on Scal  ingNextClosure. We propose a new algorithm : PFC \(par  allel Partitioning Frequent Closed itemsets  quent closed itemsets. This algorithm is a kind of decom  position algorithm of concept lattice. We use it to dynam  ically partition the search space into some non-overlapping and independent search sub-spaces. For each partition, we mine all frequent closed itemsets. There is no relation be  tween each partition. The partitions only share the same source data. We can deal with any partition independently So we can apply this algorithm for parallel, distributed and network computing We compare our algorithm PFC to the C++ executable code of CLOSET + provided by its author, and discuss the results The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present the notions of frequent closed itemsets in section 2. The search space of closed item sets is analyzed in section 3 Section 4 presents an algorithm of mining frequent closed itemsets. Some experimental results are demonstrated in section 5 2 Frequent closed itemsets Given a specified minimal support threshold \(min  support  ing frequent closed itemsets is decomposed into two sub  problems 1  port above the predetermined min-support. The whole per  formance is mainly determined by this step. It is a hard problem to generate all frequent closed itemsets for very large data. So we need more effective method to mine fre  quent closed itemsets 2 on each frequent closed itemset, which have more than pre  determined minimum confidence Definition 2.1 Data context or formal context is defined by a triple \(O,I, R a relation between 0 and I. The elements of 0 are called o?jects or transactions, while the elements of I are called items or attributes. A subset of I is called itemset Definition 2.2 Given a subset A &lt;:;;; 0 from a data context O,I, R q{their common attributes for set A &lt;:;;; 0 A':= {b E I I \(a,b Dually, we define 8' for subset q{ attributes 8 &lt;:;;; I, 8 8':= {a E O  I \(a,b These two operators are called the Galois connection for \(O,I, R A 8 


for \(O,I, R A 8 are noted as A" and 8" respectively, we have: 8 &lt;:;;; I 8" &lt;:;;; I and A &lt;:;;; 0 :::} A" &lt;:;;; 0 Thus we define two closure operators as 8 -+ 8" for set I and A -+ A" for set 0 Definition 2.3 A formal concept \(?{ the data context O,I, R A, 8 and 8 = A'. A is called extent, 8 is called intent For every set 8 &lt;:;;; I, according to the definitions 2.2 and 2.3, \(8',8 Definition 2.4 An itemset C &lt;:;;; I is a closed itemset iff C" =C Thus, a closed itemset is the intent of a formal concept Definition 2.5 Let \(0, I, R be closed itemsets, where X C I, Y C I. An association rule is an implication q{the form X:::} Y, where X n Y 0. X is called antecedent while Y is called consequence q the rule Each rule has two measurements, support and confi  dence. Support indicates how frequently the pattern occurs while confidence is a measure q{ the rule ',I' strength. The support q{ an itemset X, denoted as support \(X number of the extent of X. The support of the rule X Y, denoted as support\( X :::} Y XUY The confidence of the rule, denoted as conf\(X :::} Y support\( X UY X Proposition 2.1 Let an itemset C &lt;:;;; I be a closed itemset the support ofC is: support\(C Definition 2.6 1{ C1 and C2 are closed itemsets, C1 &lt;:;;; C2 then we say that there is a hierarchical order between C 1 and C2. In this case, C1 is called super-closed itemset, C2 is called sub-closed itemset, and we denote C1 :::; C2   All closed itemsets with the hierarchical order of closed itemsets form q{ a complete lattice called closed itemset lattice IIli Figure 1. An example of the search space of closed itemsets The first partition 1 #2 The second partition 18 a4a3a2al IIli 1112 Figure 2. An example of partitioning the search space of closed itemsets 3 Decomposition of the search space of closed itemsets Closed itemset lattice is an ordered set. The ordered re  lation and the duality are two properties for closed itemset lattice. We consider that the ordered relation and the duality should be studied for mining frequent closed itemsets The ordered relation among the closed itemsets can help us to prune the number of generating frequent closed item  sets. The following property allows us to adopt the strategy generate super-closed itemsets C if support \(C generate its sub-closed item sets else don't generate any sub-closed itemset end if Proposition 3.1 Let C1 and C2 be closed itemsets, where C1 :::; C2. We have : support\(Cd :::: support\(C2 Proof: According to the definitions of the formal concept and the closed item set, \(C ? , Cd and \(C?, C2  cepts. If C1 :::; C2, then we have C? :::: C?, that is to say support\(Cd :::: support\(C2 In order to analyze the search space of closed itemsets we show an example : a data context which contains four attributes a4, a3, a2, al. The figure 1 shows the search space of non-empty closed itemsets In this example, each node is an item set, the label of 


In this example, each node is an item set, the label of node indicates the order of the generating itemsets. If we suppose itemset a3a2 \(the label is #6 can stop to generate its sub-closed itemsets. That is to say we needn't generate a3a2al, a4a3a2 and a4a3a2al. So the search space of closed item sets can be pruned On the other hand, we try to partition the search space of closed itemsets. Here \(in figure 2 only to illustrate the main idea. The first partition is for all closed itemsets which contain only a3, a2, al. The second partition is for all closed itemsets which contain a4 It is obvious to get the following property from this ex  ample Proposition 3.2 Let ai E I be an attribute ql the data con  text \(0, I, R have support\(ai Ci When the extent of an attribute is smaller than min  support, this attribute can be omitted. For example, if support \( a4 second partition 1 x x x x 1 x x x 2 x x x x x 2 x x x x 3 x x x x x x 3 x x x x x 4 x x x x 4 x x x x 5 x x x x x 5 x x x x 6 x x x x x x 6 x x x x x 7 x x x x 7 x x x 8 x x x x 8 x x x x Data Context Frequent ordered context Figure 3. An example of data context and frequent ordered context \(min-support is 2 In order to decompose the search space of closed item  sets, we need to answer these questions: \(1 decompose the search space? \(2 in each partition? \(3  tions Analyzing all closed itemsets of a context and their search space, we define the frequent ordered context, and analyze its property in order to answer the questions Definition 3.1 A data context is called frequent ordered context, if 1 min-support, are omitted, 2 f con  text by the number qf objects that verifies each attribute from the smallest to the biggest one, and 3 with the same objects are merged as one attribute Thus in a frequent ordered context, all attributes are fre  quent. The smallest attribute is in the first column, and the biggest one is in the last column. An example is shown in figure 3. This definition make sure that the partition of fre  quent closed item sets is not empty Here we define folding search sub-space in order to de  compose the search space Definition 3.2 Let the attribute set I qf a data context O, I, R ai E I, let F3S \(ai ad which contain a;}, F3S\(ai sub-space \(F3S   In fact, a closed itemset is a subset of I of the data con  text \( 0, I, R space. This search space can be considered as the folds of certain subsets of I. All subsets of {am, ... , ai, ... , a1 U {all F3S\(ai Proposition 3.3 Given a data context \(0, I, R fthe number qfthe extent \(?f ai is n, then the size qtP3S\( ai is the minimum \(?f2n - 1 and 2i-1 Proof: Vai E I, there are 2i-1 subsets of {ai, ai-I ad that include ai. On the other hand, if the number of objects that verify attribute ai is n, we have 2n - 1 object subsets corresponding to ai. So there are at most 2n - 1 closed itemsets that include attribute ai Thus the size of F3S \(ai 2i-1 


2i-1 This proposition demonstrates the ordered context can prune the search space of closed itemsets Proposition 3.4 For a frequent ordered context, there are frequent closed itemsets in the folding search sub-space of an attribute Proof: For a frequent ordered context \(O, I, R and aj E I\( i &lt; j F3S \( ai i &lt; j This property of frequent ordered context allows certain search sub-spaces of an attribute to be formed a partition and the partition is not empty We can conclude our analysis in order to anwer the three above-mentioned questions. We need to order the data con  text into frequent ordered context. And then we can divide the search space into sub-spaces that include some F3S of attributes. Such partitions are not empty. In order to bal  ance the partitions, according to propositions 3.3 and 3.4 the attributes that are bigger can be put together to form the partition. For example, a3, a2, a1 can be in one partition the other partition contains only F3S\( a4  titioning method and the relations of partitions will be pre  sented in the next setion 4 A decomposition algorithm: PFC We propose a new algorithm, called PFC, which has two steps : determining the partitions \(see algorithm 1  erating all frequent closed itemsets in each partition \(see al  gorithm 2 4.1 Determining the partitions First, the frequent ordered context should be generated from a data context according to the min-support \(MS our algorithm, we don't preprocess the data, we only need binary context with the name of the items and transactions We don't generate a data file for frequent ordered context the frequent ordered context is only generated and stored in main memory. CHARM and CLOSET + also preprocessed the data to improve their performance Then we determine the partitions. Each partition con  tains certain attributes. Let the arribute set of the fre  quent ordered context I = {am, ... , ai, ... , ad. We choose some attributes \(including am and aI ordered context to form an order set P. If the num  ber of the elements of P is T, we have a 1 = apl &lt ap2 &lt; ... &lt; apk &lt; &lt; apT = am. We denote u 1 ::; k ::; T - 1 ai,ai] = F3S\(ai 1::; i::; m apk' apk+l[ \(0 ::; k ::; T - 1  partitions. All these partitions cover the search space of fre  quent closed itemsets. We can mine frequent closed item  sets in each partition. So the search space of frequent closed itemsets is U [apk,apHl[ U [am, am O&lt;k&lt;T-I In the first step of the algorithm \(see algorithm 1 can decide the number of partitions by a parameter P P\(O P P &lt; 1 is used to approximately balance the size of each partition When P P = 0, we get only one partition that contains all the search space. From the algorithm 1, we get the following proposition easily Proposition 4.1 The smaller the value of P P is, the more the number of partitions is All elements of listPartitions correspond to all Pk listPartitions[O] --+ PT, listPartitions[l] --+ PT-I listPartitions[T - 1] --+ PI of listPartitions to form the partitions [apk' apk+l [ and am, am], where 0 ::; k ::; T - 1. Here Pk means the posi  tion of an attribute of the frequent ordered context, and we use it to represent the attribute apk of the frequent ordered context 


context 4.2 Generating frequent closed itemsets For each generated partition, we mine the frequent closed itemsets with algorithm 2. The main method is based on the following propositions Algorithm 1 Determining the partitions 1: input a parameter PP \(0::; PP &lt; 1 2: input a parameter M S \(min-support 3: input data context 4: generate the frequent ordered context 5: create a list listPartitions to store the position of each par  tition 6: m = cardinal of the attribute set of the frequent ordered context 7: min:= m 8: k:= 0 9: while \(min &gt; 0 10: add min to listPartitions 11: min:= \(int double 12: k := k + 1 13: end while 14: T:= k liT is the number of the partitions 15: output listPartitions Proposition 4.2 Each partition is independent Proof: When we find the frequent closed itemsets of a par  tition, we only need to know the first subset and the last sub  set of this partition. And then we build next closed itemsets from the first subset until the last subset, the computing is closed in this partition. So each partition is independent. In other words, we can find all closed item sets of one partition independently Proposition 4.3 For a data context \(O, I, R I, I ={ am, ... , ai, ... , aI}, A --+ A" is the closure opera  tor. All closed itemsets form a closure system. The smallest one of all closures that is larger than A, called next clo  sure \(next closed itemset  ical order is A EB ai , where EB is defined by A EB ai A n \(am,am-I, ... ,ai+d U {ad ai E I, ai being the smallest element of I with A &lt; A EB ai by the order: am &gt; ... &gt; ai &gt; ... &gt; al In other words, for ai E I\\A, from the smallest element to larger one of I\\A, we calculate A EB ai, until we find the first time A &lt; A EB ai, then A EB ai is the next closed itemset. The proof can be seen in [6 Proposition 4.4 Let A be an itemset, A = {bk, ... , bi bI}, bi E I, bk &gt; ... &gt; bi &gt; ... &gt; bI &gt; al . Let B A n \(am' am-I, ... , ai+d U {ad ai E A, support\(B A Proof: When ai &lt; bI or ai E A, A c B, so support\(B A This proposition gives us a method to prune the non  frequent closed item sets when we find the next closed item  set. From one item set, we can find its next closed itemset But if the support of a closed itemset :::; min-support, its next closed itemset can be omitted using the proposition 7 Definition 4.1 Given a set A c I, A = {bko ... , bi bl}, bi E I. The next candidate of frequent closed item  set is the set Al  Iai = \(An \(am' am-I, ... , ai+d U {ad where ai &gt; bl and ai ? A, ai being the smallest element of I with A &lt; A l  I ai by the order: am &gt; ... &gt; ai &gt; ... &gt al   So for each partition, we compute the next closed itemset from {apK } to {apk+l} \(see algorithm 2  lation between each partition. The partitions only share the same source data. We can deal with any partition indepen  dently Algorithm 2 Generating all frequent closed itemsets in each partition 1: input frequent ordered context 2: input the index \(1 ::::: index::::: T 3: get Pk and Pk+l from listPartitions with index

In figure 4, we demonstrate how to generate different partitions for the same data Using the data context of Figure 3, we show below an example \(see Figure 4 need to generate the frequent ordered context. Given the min-support M S = 2, a2 and ag are merged as a2. As support \(a5 frequent ordered context is: as, a6, a7, a4, a3, a2, al   And then, we can give a value to the parameter to deter  mine the partitions, for example, when P P = 0.5 we get 3 partitions: [aI, a7[, [a7, as[ and [as, as]. When PP = 0.6 there are 4 partitions to generate: [aI, a4[, [a4, a6 [, [a6, as and [as, as]. When PP = 0.8,6 partitions are generated aI, a3[, [a3, a4[, [a4, a7[, [a7, a6[, [a6, as[ and [as, as When P P = 0.0 there is only one partition: [aI, as At the end, using algorithm 2, we find separately all fre  quent closed item sets in each partition. For the example of 3 partitions: [aI, a7[, [a7, as[ and [as, as], the frequent closed itemsets of each partition can be generated by algo  rithm 2 \(in Figure 4, Ci is the label of frequent closed item  sets. We get 4 frequent closed itemsets in [aI, a7[: {ad with 8 objects, {a2' al} with 5 objects, {a3, al} with 5 ob  jects, {a3, a2, ad with 2 objects, {a4' ad with 4 objects a4' a3, adwith 3 objects 5 Experimental results We have implemented PFC algorithm in Java. The experiments are performed on a PIII900 computer with 512Mo RAM and Windows XP system. We have tested our algorithm on some datasets of the UCI repository and the worst case. The worst case means the case when the sizes of  and each attribute is verified by n - 1 different objects, each object possesses n - 1 different attributes In order to supply the performance references of our al  gorithm, CLOSET + is tested on the same data. This isn't a real comparison, because 1 but CLOSET + in C++. C++ can improve performance than Java. 2 certain time to generate frequent ordered context. If the size of data is large, it will increase time-space cost. However the comparison with CLOSET + algorithm shows that our algorithm is better for large and dense data Table 1 shows some examples of our experimental re  sults on real data. The results demonstrate CLOSET+ out  perform PFC in most case. But if the size of item set is large and min-support is low, PFC is faster than CLOSET +. From table 1, the results of audiology data, lung-cancer data and soybean-large data show that PFC is faster than CLOSET For the worst case, PFC is faster than CLOSET +. In 


For the worst case, PFC is faster than CLOSET +. In table 2, the data name shows the size of data, for exam  ple, worst16 means the worst case data with 16 objects and items. It's hard to generate frequent closed itemsets for the worst case, so we only test for high min-support. Symbol I" means the algorithm needs very long time to gener  ate frequent closed itemsets, so we didn't get the result Here we demonstrate the number of partitions and maxi  mum time for one partition for PFC In summary, PFC is efficient for large dense data, and is faster than CLOSET + when the number of items is much higher than the number of objects PP=O.O PP=O.S PP=0.6 PP=0.8 Total partitions: I Total partitions: 3 Total partitions: 4 Total partitions: 6 Partition 1 [al ,  as1 #Partition l [al, a7[ #Partition I [al , a4[ #Partition 1 [ al, a3 CO: al [8J CO: al [81 CO: al [81 CO: al [8J CI : a2, al [SJ Cl : a2, al [Sl CI : a2, al [SJ Cl : a2, al [Sl C2 : a3, al [Sl C2 : a3, al [SJ C2 : a3, al [SJ #Partition2 [ a3, a4 C3 : a3, a2, al [2J C3 : a3, a2, al [21 C3 : a3, a2, al [21 CO: a3, al [SJ C4 : a4, al [4J C4 : a4, al [41 #Partition2 [a4, a6[ Cl : a3, a2, al [21 CS : a4, a3, al [31 CS : a4, a3, al [3J CO: a4, al [4J #Partition3 [ a4, a7 C6 : a7, al [4J #Partition2 [ a7, as[ Cl : a4, a3, al [31 CO: a4, al [4J C7 : a7, a2, al [3J CO: a7, al [41 C2 : a7, al [4J Cl : a4, a3, al [31 C8 : a6, a4, al [31 CI : a7, a2, al [3J C3 : a7, a2, al [3J #Partition4 [ a7, a6 C9 : a6, a4, a2, al [2J C2 : a6, a4, al [31 #Partition3 [ a6, as[ CO: a7, al [4J CIO: a6, a4, a3, al [2J C3 : a6, a4, a2, al [21 CO: a6, a4, al [3J Cl : a7, a2, al [31 C11 : as, a7, al [31 C4 : a6, a4, a3, al [2J C I : a6, a4, a2, al [2J #PartitionS [ a6, as C12: as, a7, a2, al [2J #Partition3 [as, as1 C2 : a6, a4, a3, al [21 CO: a6, a4, al [3J C13 : as, a7, a3, al [21 CO: as, a7, al [31 #Partition4 [as, asJ Cl : a6, a4, a2, al [21 CI : as, a7, a2, al [2J CO: as, a7, al [3J C2 : a6, a4, a3, al [21 C2 : as, a7, a3, al [21 Cl : as, a7, a2, al [21 #Partition6 [as, asJ C2 : as, a7, a3, al [2J CO: as, a7, atf31 Cl : as, a7, a2, al [21 C2 : as, a7, a3, al [2J Figure 4. An example of the different partitions for the same data \(The min-support is 2. The  number in brackets [ ] after each frequent closed itemset means the its support 6 Conclusion In this paper we analyze the search space of frequent closed itemsets and propose a new lattice-based algorithm PFC for mining frequent closed itemsets from data. PFC can generate non-overlapping partitions of the search space and mine frequent closed item sets in each partition. There is no relation between each partition in this algorithm. The partitions only share the same source data. We can deal with any partition independently. So we can apply this algorithm for parallel, distributed, or network computing. PFC shows good performance when dealing with very large data. Pre  liminary experimental results show that PFC outperforms CLOSET + for dense data. It is an efficient algorithm to mine frequent closed itemsets for large and dense data The ongoing research is studying the problem of balance of all partitions. And we will implement this algorithm on a parallel or distributed platform Acknowledgements We are grateful to anonymous reviewers for helpful com  ments.

efficiency then AOFI. However utilization of fuzzy concept hierarchies provides more flexibility in reflecting expert knowledge and so allows better modeling of real-life dependencies among attribute values, which will lead to more satisfactory overall results for the induction process. The drawback of the computational cost may additionally decline when we notice that, in contrast to many other data mining algorithms, hierarchical induction algorithms need to run only once through the original \(i.e. massive dataset. We are continuing an investigation of computational costs of our approach for large datasets ACKNOWLEDGMENT Rafal Angryk would like to thank the Montana NASA EPSCoR Grant Consortium for sponsoring this research REFERENCES 1] J.

the initial global candidate set would be similar to the set of global MFIs. As a result, during the global mining phase the communication and synchronization overhead is low  0 2 4 6 8 1 0 Number of Nodes Figure 5. Speedup of DMM 4.4.2 Sizeup For the sizeup test, we fixed the system to the 8-node con figuration, and distributed each database listed in Table 2 to the 8 nodes. Then, we increased the local database sire at each node from 45 MB to 215 MB by duplicating the initial database partition allocated to the node. Thus, the data distribution characteristics remained the same as the local database size was increased. This is different from the speedup test, where the database repartitioning was per formed when the number of nodes was increased. The per formance of DMM is affected by the database repartitioning to some extent, although it is usually very small. During the sizeup test, the local mining result of DMM is not changed at all at each node The results shown in Figure 6 indicate that DMM has a very good sizeup property. Since increasing the size of local database did not affect the local mining result of DMM at each node, the total execution time increased just due to more disk U 0  and computation cost which scaled almost linearly with sizeup 5 Conclusions In this paper, we proposed a new parallel maximal fre quent itemset \(MFI Max-Miner \(DMM tems. DMM is a parallel version of Max-Miner, and it re quires low synchronization and communication overhead compared to other parallel algorithms. In DMM, Max Miner is applied on each database partition during the lo 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 Amwnt of Data per Node \(ME Figure 6. Sizeup of DMM cal mining phase. Only one synchronization is needed at thc end of this phase to construct thc initial global candi date set. In the global mining phase, a top-down search is performed on the candidate set, and a prefix tree is used to count the candidates with different length efficiently. Usu ally, just a few passes are needed to find all global maximal frequent itemsets. Thus, DMM largely reduces the number of synchronizations required between processing nodes Compared with Count Distribution, DMM shows a great improvement when some frequent itemscts are large \(i.e long patterns employed by DMM for efficient communication between nodes; and global support estimation, subset-infrequency based pruning, and superset-frequency based pruning are used to reduce the size of global candidate set.

sketch-index in answering aggregate queries. Then Section 5.2 studies the effect of approximating spatiotemporal data, while Section 5.3 presents preliminary results for mining association rules 5.1 Performance of sketch-indexes Due to the lack of real spatio-temporal datasets we generate synthetic data in a way similar to [SJLL00 TPS03] aiming at simulation of air traffic. We first adopt a real spatial dataset [Tiger] that contains 10k 2D points representing locations in the Long Beach county \(the data space is normalized to unit length on each dimension These points serve as the  airbases  At the initial timestamp 0, we generate 100k air planes, such that each plane \(i uniformly generated in [200,300], \(ii, iii destination that are two random different airbases, and iv  the velocity direction is determined by the orientation of the line segment connecting its source and destination airbases move continually according to their velocities. Once a plane reaches its destination, it flies towards another randomly selected also uniform in [0.02, 0.04 reports to its nearest airbase, or specifically, the database consists of tuples in the form &lt;time t, airbase b, plane p passenger # a&gt;, specifying that plane p with a passengers is closest to base b at time t A spatio-temporal count/sum query has two parameters the length qrlen of its query \(square number qtlen of timestamps covered by its interval. The actual extent of the window \(interval uniformly in the data space \(history, i.e., timestamps 0,100 air planes that report to airbases in qr during qt, while a sum query returns the sum of these planes  passengers. A workload consists of 100 queries with the same parameters qrlen and qtlen The disk page size is set to 1k in all cases \(the relatively small page size simulates situations where the database is much more voluminous specialized method for distinct spatio-temporal aggregation, we compare the sketch-index to the following relational approach that can be implemented in a DBMS. Specifically, we index the 4-tuple table lt;t,b,p,a&gt; using a B-tree on the time t column. Given a count query \(with window qr and interval qt SELECT distinct p FROM &lt;t,b,p,a&gt WHERE t?qt &amp; b contained in qr The performance of each method is measured as the average number of page accesses \(per query processing a workload. For the sketch-index, we also report the average \(relative Specifically, let acti and esti be the actual and estimated results of the i-th query in the workload; then the error equals \(1/100 set the number of bits in each sketch to 24, and vary the number of sketches The first experiment evaluates the space consumption Figure 5.1 shows the sketch index size as a function of the number of sketches used \(count- and sum-indexes have the same results more sketches are included, but is usually considerably smaller than the database size \(e.g., for 16 signatures, the size is only 40% the database size 0 20 40 60 80

Figure 5.2a illustrates the costs of both algorithms for countworkloads with qtlen=10 and various qrlen \(the index used in this case has 16 sketches also illustrate the performance of the relational method which, however, is clearly incomparable \(for qrlen?0.1, it is worse by an order of magnitude we omit this technique Sketch-pruning always outperforms na  ve \(e.g., eventually two times faster for qrlen=0.25 increases with qrlen, since queries returning larger results tend to set bits in the result sketch more quickly, thus enhancing the power of Heuristics 3.1 and 3.2. In Figure 5.2b, we compare the two methods by fixing qrlen to 0.15 and varying qtlen. Similar to the findings of [PTKZ02]4 both algorithms demonstrate  step-wise  growths in their costs, while sketch-pruning is again significantly faster The experiments with sum-workloads lead to the same observations, and therefore we evaluate sketch-indexes using sketch-pruning in the rest of the experiments 4 As explained in [PTKZ02], query processing accesses at most two paths from the root to the leaf level of each B-tree regardless the length of the query interval Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE sketch-pruning naive relational 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 number of disk accesses query rectangle length 300 0 100 200 400 500 600 1 5 10 15 20 number of disk accesses query interval length a qtlen=10 b qrlen=0.15 Figure 5.2: Superiority of sketch-pruning \(count As discussed in Section 2, a large number of sketches reduces the variance in the resulting estimate.

Given a query, this tree facilitates the retrieval of all qualifying tuples, after which a post-processing step is performed to obtain the Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE number of distinct planes \(in the sequel, we refer to this method as 3DR method introduces a regular res  res grid of the data space, where the resolution res is a parameter.

In all cases, we achieve high compression rate \(e.g., the rate is 25% for res=25 evaluate the query efficiency, we first set the resolution to the median value 50, and use the sketch index to answer workloads with various qrlen \(qtlen=10

Conclusions While efficient aggregation is the objective of most spatio-temporal applications in practice, the existing solutions either incur prohibitive space consumption and query time, or are not able to return useful aggregate results due to the distinct counting problem. In this paper we propose the sketch index that integrates traditional approximate counting techniques with spatio-temporal indexes. Sketch indexes use a highly optimized query algorithm resulting in both smaller database size and faster query time. Our experiments show that while a sketch index consumes only a fraction of the space required for a conventional database, it can process 


required for a conventional database, it can process queries an order of magnitude faster with average relative error less than 15 While we chose to use FM sketches, our methodology can leverage any sketches allowing union operations Comparing the efficiency of different sketches constitutes a direction for future work, as well as further investigation of more sophisticated algorithms for mining association rules. For example, heuristics similar to those used for searching sketch indexes may be applied to improve the brute-force implementation ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Yufei Tao and Dimitris Papadias were supported by grant HKUST 6197/02E from Hong Kong RGC.
