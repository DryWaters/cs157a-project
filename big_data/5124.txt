In addition, most of the existing algorithms are for discovering one-dimensional association rules. Therefore, this paper defines a mining language which allows users to specify items of interest to the association rules as well as the criteria \(for example, support, confidence, etc and proposes a method based on rough set theory for multidimensional association rule mining methods, dynamically generate frequent item sets and multi-dimensional association 
rules, which can reduce the search space to generate frequent itemsets. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the algorithm and verify its feasibility and effectiveness Keywords: association rule multi-dimensional association rule; frequent itemsets; rough set I   I NTRODUCTION  An association rule describes the interesting association or relevant connection among items in the large amount of data [1  As s o c i a t io n r u le s h a v e  b e e n w i d e l y ap p l ie d  i n m a n y  areas, such as e-commerce, association analysis of the link between the web documents and so on. With the accumulation of data, many industry and researchers are increasingly interested in mining association rules, which makes the research and application of association rule 
mining is still constantly developing However, the size of the transaction database can be very large. It is very time consuming to find all the association rules from a large database and users may be only interested in some information. Moreover, the criteria of the discovered association rules may not be the same. Many uninteresting information for the user requirements can be generated when traditional mining methods are applied. Hence, a data mining language needs to be provided such that users can query only interesting knowledge to them from a large database of customer transactions. In this paper, a data mining language is presented in which users can specify the interested items and the criteria of the association rules or sequential patterns 
to be discovered Literature discussion: Association rule mining problem and Apriori algorithm were proposed firstly by Agrawal etc 2  In it ial  res e a r ch w a s la rg el y  m o tiv ate d  b y th e an aly s is o f  market basket data, the results of which allowed companies to more fully understand purchasing behavior and, as a result, better target market audiences. Some have also made optimization of Apriori algorithm, see as reference [3,4   However, Apriori-like methods may produce a large number of frequent item sets. It is time-consuming and costly to compute frequent itemsets. In response to this inherent defect, J. Han et n t r od uce d a F P g r o w t h w h i c h do e s n t  produce frequent itemsets. After the first scanning, put the frequent itemsets in the database into a compressed Frequent 
Pattern Tree \(FP-tree\, meanwhile, keep the key information and then, divide the FP-tree into certain condition bases each is relevant to 1-lenth frequent itemsets, thus mining association rules on these condition base can be performed respectively. So it can reduce the search costs and improve efficiency. However, it is unrealistic to build FP-tree based on memory when the database is large. Besides, many constraint-based mining methods have been proposed. Pei and Han [5 e ve l o p e d p a t t er n-gr o w t h  m e t h o d s  for constrained frequent pattern mining and sequential pattern mining. An item constraint specifies what is the particular individual or group of items that should or should not be presented in the pattern. In paper[6 t h e a u t hor ca t e gor i zed 
all the constraints into five classes, proposed and studied one class of constraints called convertible constraints, which can be nicely integrated into the existing framework of frequent pattern mining, moreover, developed a new constrained frequent pattern mining method, called constrained frequent pattern mining CFG. But all the above approaches cannot discover the associations among certain items and all the other items Meo R etc. proposed a SQL-like operator for extracting association rules [7 H o w e ve r  S Q L-l i k e op er at or ca nno t  completely express the associations among certain items and all the other items. Furthermore, the SQL-like operator performs have little efficiency. Yen, S.J r op o s ed a da t a  mining language for mining interesting association rules 
The approach constructs an association graph and generates all the frequent itemsets by traveling the association graph However, it needs to take a lot of memory space to record the related information To date, most of algorithms aim at mining 2-value attributes database or one-dimensional association rules mining, but multi-value attributes and multi-dimensional rules are more general. Although a number of onedimensional association rules can be extended to multidimensional association rule mining, but there are lots of problem such as low efficiency when they are applied to large database

In response to these issues above: Constraint-based approach to improve efficiency; allows users personalized requirements to mining process, obtain association rules in multi-dimensional case. This paper defines a mining language allows users to specify interesting items and criteria\(such as support, confidence, etc. moreover, propose a novel multi-dimensional association rules mining technology based on rough set, which can reduce the generation of frequent itemsets search space and improve the efficiency II  B ASIC CONCEPTS AND PROBLEM IN MULTI DIMENSIONAL ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  2.1 The basic concepts  1,10  Definition 1 Let 000\003 12     m AI I I I  000 be the set of all of items, in which 1,2 k I km  000 is called item. An itemset of length k is called an k  itemset Definition 2 A transaction  TTIDI   is a tuple where TID is the identifier of transaction, an 000G I AI 002  A transaction database TDB is the set of transactions 1 2  TDB T T Tn  000 Let X be an itemset, i.e  TTIDI   support \(also can be said as contain X if and if XT 002 The support number of X is the number of transactions which contain itemset X then the support of X  is the support number divided by the total number of transactions in TDB  Definition 3 If the support for an itemset X satisfies the user-specified minimum support threshold minsup  1 minsup TDB 003\003 then X is called a frequent itemset, simply as a large itemset Definition 4 A rule has the form  XY 000 in which X and Y are two sets of items  XTYT XY 004\004 005 000\037 and  The support of a rule XY 000 is defined as the support for the itemsets XY 006 That is   TT TDB X Y T TDB support X Y P X Y 007\010\006\002  000 006  The confidence of a rule XY 000 is defined as the ratio of the support for the itemsets XY 006 to the support for the itemset X That is      TT TDB X Y T TT TDB X T support X Y support X confidence X Y 007\010\006\002 007\010\002  000  000  If itemset XY 006 is a frequent itemset and the confidence of XY 000 is no less than the user-specified minimum confidence, then the rule XY 000 is an association rule An multidimensional association rule has the form  XY 000 in which  XY are called the antecedent and consequent of the rule respectively, refer to logic formula composed by conjunctive normal form XY 005 000\037  If a rule only described the items appears in certain case or not, then it is a single-dimensional boolean association rule, for example, buy milk 000 buy bread [support = 2 confidence= 60   If a r u le c o n c e r n  tw o or  m o r e  dimensional, such as age, income, occupation, buy computer or not and so on, then it is a multidimensional association rule. For example, age x 30 003\032 34 001 income x 42K 003\032 48K  000 buy x computer”\, in which x refer to customer 2.2 Multi-dimensional association mining Given a transaction database TDB see as table 1 support threshold is minsup confidence threshold is minconf Mining multidimensional association rules is a task to find those rules whose support is no less than minsup and confidence is no less than minconf Usually, the task can be divided to two part processes: \(1\ the identification of sets of items or itemsets within the dataset;\(2\ the subsequent derivation of inferences from these itemsets TABLE I  A TRANSACTION DATABASE OF BASKET DATA FROM A SUPERMARKET  11  TID ME G income age beer fish 000  39808 CH M 27000 46 F F 000  63762 CA F 30000 28 F T 000  10872 CA M 13200 36 T F 000  26748 CA F 12200 26 T T 000  91609 CH M 11000 24 F F 000  000  000  000  000  000  000  000  000  III  R OUGH SET THEORY  Rough Set theory, initially proposed by the Polish mathematician Z. Pawlak in 1982 [12 is a p o w erf u l to o l t o  deal with uncertainty and ambiguity of the data. To date, the theory has received an increasing attention from number of scholars all over the world [13, a n d i t ha s  b e e n w i d e l y  used in many fields, such as decision-making analysis artificial intelligence, expert systems, pattern recognition machine learning, knowledge discovery and so on Definition 5 Information system  SUAVf   where U is a non-empty finite set of n objects 12     n uu u 000 called the universe of discourse, and 000\003 12     m Aaa a  000 is a non-empty finite set of m attributes f is an information function, such that   a f ua U A V 011  for any  aA 007 i.e    a ax V x U 007\012\007  a V is called the domain of attribute a Especially, if  ACDCD 005 000*\000\037  then  SUAVf   is named a decision system \(or decision table\, where D is a decision attribute set, and C is termed the conditional attribute set. We can treat the decision attribute as a kind of classifier on the universe of objects given by an expert or a decision-maker

Definition 6 For an information system  SUAVf    one can describe relationships between objects through their attribute values. With respect to an attribute subset B A 002 a binary equivalence relation B R may be defined as   B xy U xy R ax ay a B 007\007\013=\012\007  B R is referred to the relation with respect to B derived from information system S With relation B two objects are considered to be indiscernible if and only if they have the same value on each aB 007 in other words, the indiscernibility relation of B is defined by      ind B x y U U a B f x a f y a 007×\012\007   Obviously  ind B is also a equivalence relation inducing a partition on U denoted as    UindB or simply as UB Each element in  UB is equivalence class of   ind B called as elementary set or elementary concept Definition 7 Let B A 002 call B is a reduction of A if: \(1   ind B ind A  2\here exist no  B B 004 such that    ind B ind A   IV  A PPROACH BASED ON ROUGH SET FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  4.1 Analysis of rough set fo r multidimensional association rule mining Based on rough set, we can have that  TDB T I V f    Definition 8 Indiscernibility relation   ind I induces a partition on T   UI 014  I I 014 002 Let  X be a equivalence class in it, if I k 014   I k 014  002 11     k I II I 014  000 then  X is called as k  elementary set, denoted as k X   1 1          k ii ik k X T fTI i fTI i 010\010 000 Here k X  referred to k  description  1 1   k k k XIa Ia  010\010 000  where each normal form  t t I i  is termed as description clause   t t iVI 007 For distinguish, we call the elementary set appear in the antecedent of the rule as feature class, and those elementary sets appear in the consequent of the rule as concepts Definition 9 The support of k  elementary set is         kk s up_count X card X card T  where   card X  means the cardinal of set X i.e X Let minsup be support threshold, then k X is called k  frequent elementary set, if   k s up_count X minsup 015 Denote k C as the family of all k  elementary sets k L as the family of all k  frequent elementary sets Formally, use  ij XY to represent the item in the antecedent and consequent of the rule, respectively According to  1 1   k k X xXx 010\010  000 and  1 1   k k Yy Y y 010\010 000 one can derive an association rule XY 000 between itemset XY and whose support and confidence as below, respectively  11 11           100   kk kk card X x X x Y x Y x s card U 010  010   000"\000\037 000   11 11         100    kk kk card X x X x Y x Y x c card X 010  010   000"\000\037 000  Based on the attribute reduction in RS, redundant rule can be defined as below Definition 10 If 12  XYX Y 000Ÿ\000 are two rules inducing the same concept description, where  11 2 2    kk XXx Xx Xx 010=\010\010 000   11 2 2 1 1      k k k k km km XXxXx Xx X x X x    010=\010\010=\010  010  000"\000 i.e 21 1 1   k k km km XX X x X x    010  010  000 then  XY 000 is a redundant rule According to Apriori, a subset of any frequent itemset is still a frequent itemset, any superset of a non-frequent itemset is still a non-frequent itemset, then we can have that Theorem 1 The necessary condition of a k  elementary set to be k  frequent elementary set is that all of the j  elementary set including in the k  elementary set is a frequent elementary set. 1 1 j k 003\003  To conclude, the rough set approach for multidimensional association rule mining is composed of two major operations 1\ According to Theorem 1, generate 1 k C  from k L via the conjunction operator of elementary sets as follows obtain k C then choose those feature classes whose support is no less than support threshold to form k L And then make conjunction by the feature classes of k L and 1 L to produce 1 k C   2\ Delete: According to the principle of Theorem 1 check all k  description of 1  k X  in 1 k C  if there exist  k X doesn’t appear in k L then delete k X from k C  Extract rules whose support is no less than support threshold via computing  11 11         100   kk kk card X x X x Y x Y x c card X 010  010   000"\000\037 000  in k L and delete the elementary sets corresponding to the rules, in order to avoid redundant rules 4.2 Data mining language expressing the users  personalization needs \(Personalized Data Mining Language PDML The data mining la nguage for interesting multidimensional association rules is defined as follows.

We divide the query into two cases. Case 1: there are items in the antecedent and consequent of the discovered rules specified. Case 2: there are items in the consequent of the discovered rules specified, but the item in the antecedent is not specified, which can be any items. Suppose that the itemset specified in the antecedent of the discovered rules in Case 1 is 1  t XX X  000 and the itemset specified in the consequent of the discovered rules is 1    YY Ys  000 We propose an efficient algorithm named MIMAR-RS \(Mining Interesting Multi-dimensional Association Rules based on Rough Set\ to find all the interesting association rules according to the user requirements, which is described as follows Input: transaction data base TDB minimum support minsup minimum confidence minconf  Output: multidimensional association rules sets that satisfy the user requirements RL Process Step1: Initialization RL 005  Step 2:Scan TDB find all 1-item feature classes, to form the set 1 C of 1-elementary sets, and compare these elementary sets’ support to minsup TDB  then find all the frequent 1-itemsets, generating 1 L  Step3: Obtain elementary sets containing the itemset specified and their support   11 11      ts ts Xx Xx Yy Yy 010 010=\010  000"\000 for case 1  1 1   s s Yy Yy 010  000 for case 2\, If there is no elementary set satisfy support threshold, then the algorithm end; else all elementary sets no less than minsup compose k L where k is referred to the length of itemset that user specified kst  for case 1 ks  for case 2\.

From the data mining language, users can specify the interested items or the sequences, and the minimum support and the minimum confidence threshold to discover interesting multidimensional association rules. And then according to Rough set theory, we transform multi-dimensional association rules to elementary sets description, antecedents corresponding with feature classes, consequent corresponding with concept in RS, and then propose the efficient data mining algorithm MIMAR-RS to process the user requirements, combined with the idea of generating frequent itemsets dynamically thus reducing the search space to produce frequent itemsets reducing the time complexity.

References attribute In this paper we discussed how to model domain knowledge with a semantic network and apply it to association rule analysis Our semantic association rule analysis can generate semantically valid hypothesis and assess data quality We successfully applied our method to a public health dataset and obtained promising results This work is funded by National Science Foundation grant CNS 0851984 and Department of Homeland Security grant 2009-ST-061-C10001  Agra w al R Mannila H  Srik an t R T oiv o nen H and Verkamo A I Fast Discovery of Association Rules In Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining U M Fayyad et al Eds AAAI press 1996  Ba y ardo R J a nd Agra w al R Mining the Most Interesting Rules In Proceedings of the Fifth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining San Diego CA United States August 15 18 1999  Chen P  V erma R  Meininger J C a nd Chan W 2008 Semantic analysis of association rules In Proceedings of the International FLAIRS Conference FL USA 2008  Eissa M Meininger J C Nguy en T a nd Chan W The Relationship of Ambulatory Blood Pressure to Physical Activity in a TriEthnic Population of Obese and Nonobese Adolescents American Journal of Hypertension Volume 20 Issue 2 Pages 140-147  Gupta N K Mueller W H Chan W and Meininger J C Is Obesity Associated with Poor Sleep Quality in Adolescents American Journal of Human Biology  the O\003cial Journal of the Human Biology Council 14\(6 2002 7 7 Related Work 8 Conclusion Acknowledgments BBC shows that the attributes in the dataset are semantically self-closed since not many hypothesis can be generated which indicates that the Heartfelt study was very carefully designed Association rule mining has been proved to be very useful in many applications One major obstacle in practice is how to identify correct interesting user-speci\223c rules from a huge number of redundant wrong or trivial rules Recently association rule post-processing has become a very active research area Based on whether external knowledge sources are used we can divide the existing methods into objective measure based methods and knowledge based methods Objective measure based methods do not require any domain information besides the rule set itself and can be used by both domain experts and novice users However lack of domain knowledge makes it impossible to detect wrong rules that are just coincidence and do not 215make sense\216 and lack of user input results in presenting many rules already known by users Based on the analysis tasks this type of methods can be further divided into 1 Metric-based rule evaluation This type of approaches use metrics to evaluate the signi\223cance or interestingness of an association rule such as lift statistical h yp o thesis tests 18 U nin teresting rules will be discarded However as shown in eac h metric has di\002eren t prop erties and may be useful only for some speci\223c domains and applications and choosing the right metric is often di\003cult 2 Rule summarization and generalization To reduce the number of rules that need manual analysis rules are analyzed with their context These methods investigate relations among rules in order to present users a concise rule set 3 Rule ranking a nd 20 discussed ho w to extract top-k signi\223cant rules with low redundancy Q
