Binary Prediction Based on Weighted Sequential Mining Method Shuchuan Lo  Industrial Engineering and Management of National Taipei University of Technology Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C sclo@ntut.edu.tw Abstract This paper presents a weighted-binary-sequential method to predict the status of customer patronage for the next day. Most of the research using association rules to mine sequential data focus on the algorithms and computing efficiency of pattern or rule generation. But few of them consider the time value of the sequential data It is desirable to weight recent observations more heavily 
than remote observations in the analysis of time-series data. In this paper, we address a time-weighted concept on association algorithm to mine the binary-time-series data. The weighted binary sequence algorithm will give more weight on the recent data in finding the longest frequent patterns from binary-time-series data. There are two weighting methods; dynamic-length weighting and fixed-length weighting. Both algorithms are compared to the un-weighted algorithm to show how time value influences the prediction accuracy. Some performance results with a real-life website application given in this paper show that time-weighted sequential algorithms are generally superior to un-weighted sequential algorithm Keywords: CRM; Binary-time-series data; Sequential

Introduction To predict the next visit from customer behavior is an important topic in customer relationship management CRM u siness ca n pre pare the pe rs ona lized service in advance to improve the satisfaction and strengthen the loyalty of customers through such a prediction result There are limited web speed and CPU resources for an online company. A company can pre-allocate their cache memory to promote the speed of web-page reviewing if they can get a list of customers in advance Our case study in this research is based on the transaction database of a Karaoke website. We transfer the consumer records into a binary time series by calendar day, in which digit 1 represents customer visiting the 
website on that day and 0 represents not. If a customer visits the website more than once in a day, we still use digit 1 to indicate the presence. In this research, we modified the binary sequence algorithm of sequential pattern mining [6 ex tract th e cu st o m er p a ttern  fro m the binary time series data. The pattern is used to predict the customer attendance of the next day The binary sequence algorithm does not consider the time value of the time series like other sequential pattern mining methods. Most of the sequential pattern mining algorithms mine the patterns only based on the frequency of occurrence. Nevertheless, it is desirable to weight recent observations more heavily than remote observations in the analysis of time-series data. This 
concept is generally acknowledged in the time-series prediction model of statistics. But this concept did not included in sequential mining algorithms. In this paper we address the time-weighted concept on binary sequence algorithm. The weighted binary sequence algorithm will give more weight on the recent data in finding the longest frequent patterns from binary-time-series data of an individual customerês patronage. There are two weighting dynamic-length weighting and fixed-length weighting Both algorithms are compared to the un-weighted algorithm to show how time value influences the prediction accuracy The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2, we review some related sequential pattern mining algorithms. Section 3 describes binary sequential algorithm and weighted binary sequential algorithm. In Section 4 we present the experimental results of weighted algorithm compared to un-weighted algorithm. Finally we conclude the paper in Section 5 2. Related Research Sequential pattern mining is first proposed by Agrawal and Srikant presented AprioriAll algorithm to mine the sequential pattern. A sequence s is a set of items ordered by transaction time. To mine the patterns, we first need to calculate the support of itemsets within sequence space S Next, we must determine whether the patterns \(itemsets\quent, where a 
pattern is frequent if its support is greater than or equal to the user-specified threshold. The support of a pattern is defined as the fraction of customers who supports this itemset.

this algorithm. First we need to generate the candidate sequences. Second we need to calculate the support of candidates. A sequence consists of elements and items For example, the sequence s 2, 3, 4\shown in Fig. 1, reveal that items 1, 2, 3 and 4 makes two elements 1\ and \(2, 3, 4\. A sequence can make many subsequences s i A subsequence s i is called as k sequence if s i consists of k items, such as <\(1\represents 1-sequence and <\(2, 3, 4 Users need to specify a support threshold for frequent sequence patterns. If we set the threshold equal to 2, the 1-sequences of Fig. 1 are given in Fig. 2. For example, the 1-sequence <\(1\ appears in four transactions. Therefore, its support is equal to 4. All the 1-sequences are frequent because their support is greater than the threshold 2. The next step is to join any two frequent 1-sequences into 2-sequences. In this algorithm there is no replication. Therefore there is no 2-sequence 1\wo frequent 1-sequences, <\(1 3\n join to four 2-sequences in sequential mining 1\, <\(1, 3\nd <\(3, 1\A candidate k-sequence is joined by two \(k-1\, s1 and s2. In the joining process, the joining order has to be 2\ join s2=<\(2, 4\ is 2,4\, where the last element of s1 and the first element of s2 have to be equal, otherwise these two sequences cannot be joined. Figure 3 shows the frequent 2-sequences and 3-sequences. In this example, we cannot join any two 3-sequences to 4-seqence, therefore, the algorithm stops. If there is no frequent sequence, then the algorithm stops also 2.2 LA x Algorithm The sequential mining algorithm of Agrawal et al. is not applicable for web surfing situation proposed an algorithm called LA x to solve the repeated sequential mining problem h e L A x also generates candidate sequence from 1-sequence and finds frequent sequences until there is no more candidate sequence. But the calculations of support and threshold are different in LA x The support of LA x does not count the transactions but count all the repeated sequences. For example, there are 5 transactions in Fig. 4. Subsequence <A> appears 3 times in transaction 1 and once in transaction 2. Therefore the support of subsequence <A> is 4 in this example Transaction No Sequences 001 002 003 004 005 1 5 1 2,3,4 1,3 1 2,3,4 5 5 Fig. 1.

Frequent 2-sequence and 3-sequence The threshold depends on the total amount of the same length of subsequences. The definition is k threshold   ss | |ss| = k and ss s and s D  minsup-ratio  where D is a database s is a sequence ss is a k subsequence of s and minsup-ratio is a fixed minimum threshold ratio. The total amount of k sequences is decreased when the length k increases. Therefore, the threshold of k-sequence might be lower than the threshold of \(k-1\quence. To prevent the violation of the rule, in which parent is not a frequent sequence, child should not be frequent, LA x designs a special threshold named Next Path Large Threshold. The superscript x means that the algorithm can look ahead \(LA\x steps to make sure the k-subsequence is still frequent in \(k+x\uence. If we set x = 1 and the fixed ratio equal to 10% in the example of Fig. 4, the large threshold \(LT\of candidate 1-sequence is 21*10% = 2.1 and the next large threshold \(NLT 16*10% = 1.6, where there are 21 1-sequences and 16 2-sequences, respectively. For 2-sequences, the large threshold is 1.6 and the next path large threshold is 11 10% = 1.1. Figure 5 shows that the support of candidate 1-sequence is greater than large-threshold 2.1 in LS1 column and the support of candidate 1-sequence is greater than next-path-large-threshold 1.6 in an NPLS1 column We join any two 1-sequences in NPLS1 to form the candidates of 2-sequence as shown in Fig. 6. The 3-sequence and the 4-sequence are presented in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively. Since there is no more candidate sequence that can be generated by the NPLS of 4-sequence, the algorithm stops In the LA x algorithm, authors also defined the confidence of frequent sequential pattern. The definition of confidence is , in which the confidence\(X Y support\(Z\upport\(X\, sequence X connected sequence Y. For example, the confidence of frequent sequential pattern <ABAB> in Fig. 8 is confidence\(AB AB\ support\(ABAB\upport\(AB 1/3 = 33.3%. The GSP algorithm does not discuss the confidence of frequent sequential pattern. In the application, we can set up a minimum confidence \(MC as a second threshold to re-filter those frequent patterns with confidence less than MC Transaction No Sequence Sequence Length 001 002 003 004 005 ABABCA BABD EFGE HIJI KHK 6 4 4 4 3 Fig. 4.

Research Methods 3.1 Binary Sequence Algorithm The Binary Sequence Algorithm \(BSA\ adapted from LA 1  The al gorithm  is listed in Fi g. 9. Bot h the threshold design and confidence calculation of binary sequence algorithm follow the LA x algorithm except that this algorithm only employs binary sequence data. We use a simple example shown in Fig. 10 to demonstrate the process of BSA. The length of this binary data is 20. We set the minimum support ratio as 10%. The threshold of Large 1-Sequence \(LS1\20*10% = 2. The threshold of Next Pass of Large 1-Sequence \(NPLS1\19*10% = 1.9 Candidate 2-sequence \(CS2\is joined by NPLS1. There are four CS2: <11>, <10>, <01> and <00>. All of CS2 are greater than the threshold of NPLS2, 1.8. The four NPLS2 are shown in Fig. 11. We repeat the algorithm until we cannot generate any next candidate sequence or NPLSk. The results of 3sequence, 4-sequence and 5-sequence are shown in Fig. 12, 13 and 14, respectively We cannot generate any CS6 because there is only one NPLS5 in 5-sequence. Hence the algorithm stops in that sequence. The longest frequent subsequence is LS max  10101> in this example. We will use this frequent pattern to do the prediction in Section 3.2 3.2 Prediction We need to transfer the frequent pattern <10101 into the prediction pattern <1010 1> before predicting The prediction pattern <1010 1> means if the past records are <1010>, then we predict the next outcome to be <1>. The confidence of this prediction is calculated as Confidence\(1010 1  support\(10101\ / support\(1010  2 / 2 = 100% as we mentioned in Section 2.2. In this research, there are only two outcomes in prediction, 0 or 1. Therefore, we set the threshold of confidence to be greater than 50%, not exactly 50% in order to avoid the conflict of 0 and 1 having 50% confidence at the same time. All of the prediction patterns and the confidences of the frequent patterns from Fig. 11 to 14 are shown in Fig 15. The prediction patterns with confidences greater than 50% are shown in Fig. 15 \(c In this research, the longer the prediction pattern, the higher the representation and priority. For example, we want to predict the next appearance of the subsequence 1110> using the prediction pattern <1010 1> as shown in Fig. 16. We compare whether the subsequence <1110 fits with the pattern <1010> first.

The 5-Sequence with LT = 1.6 and NPLT 1.5 two sequences are not equal. Hence, we take the next longest prediction pattern<011 0>. We compare the last three elements of subsequence <110> with prediction the pattern <011>. If they fit, then we predict the next element to be 0. Otherwise, take the next prediction pattern until we can get the prediction result. In Fig. 16 the prediction pattern <10 1> fits the last-two-element subsequence <10> finally. Therefore, the prediction result is <1>. In this research, we use Correctness = Success in k-day prediction / k * 100 to evaluate the correctness of prediction. We give an example to demonstrate how to calculate the correctness for the next 10 days from the original binary sequence of Fig. 10. If the prediction of 21 st day is 1 and the true result is 1, then the prediction is a success. We add the new element into the binary sequence. If the subsequence for the future 10 days is <1010110110> and our prediction subsequence is <1111110110>, then the correctness is 8 / 10 * 100% = 80%. The higher the correctness we get, the more reliable the prediction we have. If we cannot judge the next outcome as 0 or 1, the correctness will set to be 0% directly in this research 3.3 Weighted Binary Sequence Algorithm  Time series data use weighted concept in statistical prediction. All the sequential mining algorithms do not consider that the recent data are more valuable than the remote data in prediction. In this research, we add this time-value concept in the binary sequence algorithm, i.e weighted binary sequence algorithm. The basic idea of the weighted binary sequence algorithm is to multiply a constant to the support of large sequence. We define three terms in this algorithm. The weighting length is the number of days or the length of subsequence we want to weight. The weight is the multiplier we add to the subsequence. The subsequence with a length equal to the weighting length can decompose into many subsequences with length less than the weighting length. We call these subsequences the weighted subsequences. For example LS max is <10101> in Fig. 10. Suffix max is the max length of large sequence. In this example, max =5. We weight all A B C Fig. 15.

the subsequences with length less than max. In this research, we design two weighting lengths. One is max n, n is some positive integer. The other is a user-defined fixed length, such as the last 5 or 7 days. The former with dynamic weighting length is called dynamic model whereas the latter is called fixed model The weighted binary sequence algorithm is shown in Fig. 17. We find LS max first. Then all the subsequences with length from 2 to max are our weighted subsequences The truncate function is to truncate the subsequence of the original binary sequence s before the last subsequence with length equal to wlen + kw -1 where wlen is the weighting length and kw is from 2 to max. The output of truncate function is represented as s kw The set of all the subsequences of s kw with length = kw is called candidate sequences of s kw  CSS k For example, the max of the original sequence in Fig. 10 is equal 5. We assume that wlen = max * 1 = 5 * 1 = 5 and kw = 2. We truncate the front subsequence of the original sequence to get the last subsequence s kw 101110> with length wlen  kw 1 5 + 2 -1 = 6. We get CSS 2 10>, <01>, <11>, <11 10>}. We combine CSS 2 and LS 2 LS with length = 2 produced from the last step\ to be the weighted candidate 2-sequences WCS 2 We only recalculate the support value for those subsequences appearing in CSS 2 such as the support of <11>, Sup<11> = Support s 11 Support s kw  W 1\5 + 2 * \(2-1\re W is the weight defined by user, which is set to be 2 in here Figure 18 shows all the weighted subsequences from length = 2 to length = max = 5. Figure 19 shows the comparisons of support of candidate subsequences before and after weighting with length = 2 and length = 3 respectively. From Fig. 19, we can observe an increase in support of subsequences because of the weighting process The threshold of large sequence is also to be adjusted. We set the new length of original sequence after weighting as the length of original sequence\\(weighting length weight -1\For example, the adjusted threshold of large 2-sequence in the case of Fig. 10 is \(new length -1\10 20\+ \(5\\(2-1\Ö 1\= \(25 Ö 1\* 10% = 2.4 The threshold of LS2 is 1.9 before the weighting process The 2-sequence passed the adjusted large threshold is called weighted large 2-sequence, WLS2.

The Support Changes from un-weighted to weighted for k = 2 and k = 3 The weighted binary sequence algorithm is to lengthen the original sequence. It may cause some large patterns that are different from those produced by binary sequence algorithm because the support and threshold are changed after weighting. But the weighting process will not change the prediction process. Therefore, the prediction of weighted binary sequence algorithm is the same as binary sequence algorithm which is mentioned in Section 3.2. No further discussion is included 4. Experiments 4.1 Data Background In this research, we analyze a transaction database of Karaoke online company to compare the prediction correctness between weighted binary sequence algorithm and un-weighted algorithm. The transaction data are transferred into binary data. If a customer ordered music albums in a day, no matter how many albums she/he ordered, we set 1 in binary sequence. Otherwise, we set 0 This binary time sequence represents a customer ordering music albums or visiting the website before the analysis day Most of the customers are students; therefore, the consuming behavior has significant difference during vacation and school days. We separate transaction data into three periods, summer vacation \(July 1 to August 31 62 days\beginning period of semester \(September 1 to October 31, 61 days\nd the steady period of semester November 1 to December 31, 61 days\We choose customers with the visit rate \(days of visit / period *100 greater than 40% to be our samples. There are 96 samples in the vacation \(summer\period, 52 samples in the semester beginning and 30 in the steady period. In the weighting experiment, we set the weighting length = max n, n = 1, 2, 3 for dynamic model. For fixed model, there are 7 kinds of weighting length; they are 5-20 days. The values of weight are equal to 2, 3 and 4, respectively, for two models. There are 9 experiments for dynamic model and 21 for fixed model totally. The prediction is set by future 10 days with the threshold ratio of 10 Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence \(WIê05 0-7695-2415-X/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


4.2 Experimental Results Summer Vacation Period Karaoke website received the largest music orders from July to August in a year. Figure 20 shows a correctness comparison for dynamic model. Weight value of 2 combined with 2 times weighting length has the largest correctness. A weight value equal to 3 has steady performance. In general, weighted algorithm is better than un-weighted algorithm no matter what the weight value or weighting lengths Figure 21 is correctness comparison for fixed model It shows the same situation that the weighted algorithm has higher correctness than the un-weighted algorithm except for the weight value equal to 2 with weighting length equal to 7 days For all weighting combinations, weighting length equal to 10 days has generally better correctness than other weighting lengths Beginning Period of Semester The correctness of prediction for the beginning period of the semester is shown in Fig. 22 \(dynamic model Fig. 23 \(fixed model\In this period, students will diminish their entertainment. In Fig. 22, the correctness of weight values equal to 2 and 3 are superior to the cases of un-weighted and weight value equal 4. The correctness of weight value of 4 is decreased by enlarging the weighting length. In Fig. 23, the correctness of weighted case is superior to un-weighted case. Th e weight value of 2 has the best performance. Weighting length of 7 days has generally higher correctness than the others. In this period the correctness of weighting process compared to un-weighting process increases to at most 6% which is 2 times of summer period. It appears to weight the recent data having more effect when data have larger alteration Steady Period of Semester Dynamic model and fixed model for steady period are depicted in Fig. 24 and in Fig. 25, respectively. From Fig. 24, dynamic model, we can see that the doubling of weighting length has generally higher correctness in this period. If you give more weight value then you may use shorter weighting length. The correctness of weight values of 3 and 4 are similar. It implies that the weight value increasing from 3 to 4 in this period does not improve the prediction effect. For fixed model, 20-day weighting length has a better correctness in this steady period. Weight values equal to 3 and 4 are superior to un-weighted and weight value equal to 2 From these three periods discussed above, the results of weighted algorithm have generally higher correctness than those of un-weighted algorithm. In the dynamic model, a weight value of 3 combined with 1 or 2 weighting length has high correctness in all periods. In the fixed model, the correctness of weight value equal to 3 combined 7-day to 10-day weighting length is recommended by the experiment. The weighting process has more significant effect in large variation period. The dynamic model and fixed model have almost equal performance in three periods. The weighting process can increase on an average of 3% to 6% correctness when compared to the un-weighted process 5. Conclusion To weight recent observations more heavily than remote observations is a common concept in time series analysis but has not been adapted in sequential mining algorithm. In this research we proposed a weighted binary sequence algorithm to add the time value concept on sequential mining algorithm. We use a real transaction database to experiment the effect of weighted process compared to un-weighted process. The results of experiment reveal that the correctness of weighted algorithm is generally higher than those of un-weighted algorithm. It implies that the time value does have influence in the correctness of prediction. Even in our experiments there is only 3-6% correctness improvement Our future research will apply this time value concept on other possible sequential mining algorithms to seek higher promotion in prediction correctness Acknowledgments The research was supported by National Science Council of Taiwan, R.O.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
