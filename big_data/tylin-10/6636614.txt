person detectors have been proposed to be used as underlying detector for example based on pictorial structures with discriminative part detectors  1  Edgelet-based part detectors  6  the Implicit Shape Model  8  4  or a Histograms of Oriented Gradients HOG detector  4  W e e xplore the poselet detector  3  as underlying detector  which can by construction deal with a wide range of poses Unlike previous work we explicitly take into account the computational demand of the detector and propose a dynamic subsampling technique of the parts depending on the track history see Sec 4.1  as well as for track initialization see Sec 4.2  In order to connect detections to tracks many recent approaches 002rst detect all possible person locations globally in all frames and then associate them 002rst to short and reliable tracklets then to longer tracks  6  10  11  Such associationbased tracking turns out to be robust against occlusions and mismatches however it requires knowledge of all frames in advance and therefore is only suitable in of\003ine settings This is a strong requirement which cannot always be met for example for real-time tracking in a camera network In order to perform online-tracking a popular choice is to employ a particle 002lter  4  Since we do not w ant to restrict ourselves to of\003ine settings we employ a particle 002lter as well in this paper However in contrast to  4  we not only use it for the purpose of tracking but also as a means to restrict the number of required evaluations of the detector in order to improve runtime see Sec 3.1  2 Person Detection For person detection we build on the part-based poselet approach by Bourdev et al   3  A poselet part detector is a HOG feature-based linear support vector machine classi\002er Training data for a speci\002c part is selected by the actual underlying 3D-pose of the person in the selected partial view of the training image As such parts which might be visually similar but do not stem from the same pose will not end up in the same part classi\002er Part detectors can actually be for very speci\002c poses e.g  a 223right arm crossing a torso\224 Each poselet detection casts a vote towards the full bounding box of the person These votes are clustered and con\002dence-thresholded before being accepted as 002nal person detections We employ a set of more than 1000 poselet part detectors 1  The large number of body part detectors results in a good robustness to partial occlusions pose and orientation variation but of course results in a high computational cost which is roughly linear to the number of parts 3 Tracking Approach In our tracking approach we apply a particle 002lter in combination with poselet detector as follows For a new 1 We use the pre-trained models from http://www.cs.berkeley.edu 030 lbourdev/poselets track see Sec 3.4  a random set of particles is initialized with uniform weights In each time step particles are propagated through a system model into a new state Each particle's state is evaluated by an observation model which updates the particle weights accordingly For the next timestep a new set of particles is sampled from the old set according to their weights For further details on particle 002ltering please refer to  7  State We model a track i at time t with a threedimensional state containing the location within the image as well as a scale value that represents the size of the track state i t   x i t  y i t  s i t    1 The scale value is related to the size of a person detection through s i t  w i t w base with the width of the track's person hypothesis w i t and the base width of the person detector w base  Propagation A simple noise-based motion model is used for particle propagation  x i t  y i t    x i t 000 1   loc  y i t 000 1   loc  2 s i t  s i t 000 1   scale 3 with noise terms  loc and  scale which are randomly drawn from zero mean Gaussian distributions N loc 0  033 2 loc   N scale 0  033 2 scale   While 033 scale is a 002xed parameter over the course of a sequence the standard deviation for the location within the image is individual to each track and computed as 033 loc  033 loc base 003 f  s i t 000 1   This follows the intuition that larger person detections are closer to the camera and their movements have a greater effect in terms of image coordinates We explicitly do not use a velocity-based motion model results in order to increase robustness in cases where a tracked object abruptly changes direction Note that these changes in track direction can also be caused by camera movement when the camera is not 002xed as is often the case in multimedia data We use two observation models for scoring the particles in order to include both evidence from the detector and appearance cues into each particle's weight 3.1 Detector Observation Model The detector observation model updates the weight w i j of the j th particle of track i based on poselet detection scores Given a particle state and a poselet detector one can compute the expected location of a potential positive poselet response A poselet detection  x pl  y pl  w pl  h pl  with votes  v x  v y  v w  v h  and scale s pl  w pl votes for a person detection  x ps  y ps  w ps  h ps    x pl  v x s pl  y pl  v y s pl  v w s pl  v h s pl   In reverse 226 starting from the person 44

max track t i area t i  area d n area t i  area d n 025 thr match or 11 9 t i  area t i  area d n  area t i  12 The second case is based on the observation that new persons cannot 002rst appear in full occlusion If a remaining detection has a high score a track is created from it If its score is too low but more detections are found in the same area over multiple consecutive timesteps their scores are accumulated When this accumulated score becomes high enough a new track is created as well In our implementation we require detections accumulate a score of at least thr score over a maximum of 002ve frames The score threshold depends on the detection scale s d and is set to thr score  50 d s  Note that poselet person detection scores are computed as the sum of all contributing poselet scores Therefore high score values are common Tracks are terminated if they either leave the image area or do not get suf\002cient support from their observation models over a period of one second 4 Dynamic Part Sub-Selection We propose a dynamic approach to reduce the number of part-detectors required in the observation model and during track initialization 4.1 Track\255speci\002c Part Selection In order to speed up the particle evaluation in the observation model while retaining the important detectors and thus the tracking accuracy we keep an individual set of detectors with each track The set is divided into two sub-sets a core set and a dynamic set  The core set is meant to contain detectors that are expected to have high relevance for the track The detectors in the dynamic set are randomly selected at each timestep from those that are not in the current core set That way we ensure that each available detector is used every once in a while For each detector d k  we keep the number of times c u k it was used A second value c h k denotes the 223usefulness\224 of the detector for the current track This usefulness is determined as the sum of scores of all detections that supported particles of the track The ratio r h k  c h k c u k is the relative usefulness of the detector Each time the observation model evaluates a track's particles the core set is 002rst 002lled with those detectors that have the highest r h k  The dynamic set is then 002lled with a random selection of the remaining detectors r h k is computed over a recent history of the track to prevent detectors that were initially supporting the track strongly but do not any more from remaining in the core set for too long The number of frames in the history is set to correspond to two seconds of video Figure 2 The detectors of the core subset hits in yellow provide stronger hits than those of the dynamic subset hits in magenta Higher detection scores correspond to a larger radius Using this dynamic detector management runtime performance can be increased while the bene\002ts of a large number of part detectors remain intact This approach works well together with the pose-based nature of the poselet detectors A standing person may be well detected by a pedestrian poselet and as the person sits down it may go through a range of poselets that correspond to the current body pose In this way the detector core set gathers knowledge speci\002c to the track it belongs to represented by the types of poselets it contains Fig  2  depicts detector hits from the core and the dynamic subset In a sitting and occluded position the core subset mostly contains detectors that focus on the face but for a standing person a much wider range of detectors is in the core set Note that this approach to select from a larger detector pool could also be used in combination with holistic person detectors that may be trained for different angles or viewpoints 4.2 Part Selection for Initialization The track initialization step can also be sped up signi\002cantly by using a subset of detectors Starting from a random selection of detectors the set is regularly repopulated by those detectors that performed best in the past Detectors are considered to perform well if they contributed to detections that lead to new tracks being created or caused detections that matched existing tracks The set of part detectors that lead to a new track initialization is used as an initialization of the new track's core subset see Sec 4.1  While the track detector subsets contain information speci\002c to each track the initialization detector subset gathers global information about the scene In this way we are able to leverage track speci\002c information and scene speci\002c information using the same approach without having to make any prior assumptions 46 


5 Experimental Results 5.1 Datasets We evaluate our approach on two datasets The CAVIAR dataset 2 consists of surveillance videos captured by a static camera in a corridor of a shopping mall This dataset has a very low resolution 384 002 288 and contains several scenes with occlusions We created a modi\002ed set of groundtruth annotations where we 002xed some annotation oddities such as person bounding boxes that only surround the foot of a person if the rest is occluded We will make this corrected groundtruth available online 3  In order to provide comparability with previous work we report results on both the original and the corrected groundtruth We further evaluate on a dataset consisting of the 002rst 6 episodes of the TV show The Big Bang Theory BBT This multimedia dataset has a higher resolution of 1024 002 576 moving cameras many different angles non-pedestrianlike poses  e.g  sitting inter-object occlusions and persons are frequently only partially visible because they are cut off by the camera Each episode is about 20 minutes in length and contains around 30  000 frames We labelled every 10th frame as groundtruth 5.2 Evaluation Methodology We use Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy MOTA  2  as evaluation metric M OT A  1 000 P t M ISS t  F P t  M M t P t GT T 13 where M ISS t is the number track misses F P t the number of false positive tracks M M t the number of track switches mismatches and GT t the number of groundtruth tracks at time t  For the CAVIAR dataset we report the average MOTA over all sequences and for the BBT dataset the average MOTA over all cuts of an episode 5.3 Results For our experiments on both datasets we chose a 002xed number of 100 particles We set the base value for propagation in location 033 loc base to 1 The larger person sizes in the BBT dataset adjust this value automatically Unless otherwise speci\002ed we use all available part detectors in our experiments CAVIAR On the CAVIAR dataset our approach achieves a MOTA of 60 On the modi\002ed groundtruth the number of false positive tracks and track misses decrease slightly In Table  1  we compare our performance to one of the best results on the dataset by Huang et al   6  who achie v ed 80 2 http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CAVIARDATA1 3 http://cvhci.anthropomatik.kit.edu/projects/pri Huang et al  6  Ours Ours MGT MOTA 80.00 60.26 61.32 Misses 20.00 34.22 32.58 FP rate 0.025 0.198 0.192 Table 1 Results on the CAVIAR dataset on original and modi\002ed ground truth MGT compared to a state of the art approach that uses additional scene information accuracy Note that their approach is not directly comparable to ours because it relies on automatically determined scene knowledge such as a groundplane and information about entry-exit zones We chose not to use such information because our approach is intended to work even on data with moving cameras where groundplanes and entryexit zones cannot be automatically determined Another difference that factors into the comparison of the two results is that while Huang et al  optimize their trajectories over the entire length of a scene our approach is an online approach and does not require global knowledge of all frames Lastly experiments show that we loose most accuracy in those sequences where many very small persons appear and stay in the background In these cases the part-based person detector generates few low-score detections that do not allow for reliable track initialization The Big Bang Theory dataset On the Big Bang Theory dataset we compare our approach to our own implementation of an association-based tracker  9  which is similar in approach to  6  Our online approach achie v es a higher accuracy due to a lower number of mismatches which can be explained by our use of an appearance model Results are shown in Table 2  Both tracking approaches used the same set of detections Dynamic Part Selection In order to evaluate the effect of the detector part selection we run our approach with different subset sizes on both datasets The results are depicted in Fig 3  The subset size in the plots refers to the entire detector subset which we split evenly into core and dynamic set When using detector subsets only for the track observation model we observe a moderate overall speedup at a small cost in accuracy The speedup gained during the particle weighting gets masked by the more cost intensive person detection during the track initialization step which takes about 10 seconds per image The tracking time is the same on both datasets because input images are scaled to a uniform size before tracking Using all available detectors the track weighting initially takes approximately 410ms per track Using a subset of 600 detectors scoring time is reduced to 230ms and with 200 detectors the required time lies below 100ms This corresponds to a speedup of 4.2 for the track scoring step The loss in MOTA is caused by a larger number of misses which 47

 Fig. 10. Complementarity Analysis forSMTCL and Dalian Guangyang  V. CONCLUSIONS  This paper provides a method based on text mining of patents to help extract technology intelligence to facilitate M&A. We take the NCS industry as an example. NCS is the most important part of numerical machine tools. The paper follows a technology forecasting approach and outlines a technology synergy analysis based on a multi-term Boolean search to distinguish NCS records This study has a few limitations. Some doubt remains regarding the reliability of patent data. Sometimes patent data cannot reflect the core techno logy of a company because some patent-based indicators could be obscured by strategic behavior; that is, sometimes an emerging technology is not yet permitted for patenting. Another limitation is that the latest patent data we studied are2 years old because of the 18-month patent application period. In the meantime, some changes in NCS-related technology may well have occurred Within these limitations, the paper sought to forecast developmental trends for key candidate technologies, and based on the technology trends revealed, look for technology acquisition candidates for a certain company  The technology forecasting results suggest that NCS has become a global research hotspot in the field of machine tools in recent years, and patents have reached increased significance in corporate activity. The analysis of country-topic correlation leads us to conclude that there are two research clusters in the wo rld, one centered in Japan and the USA, the other centered on Germany. While China is geographically far away from th e other countries, it has only a faint relationship with Japan and Taiwan; in this relationship the key words are control,signal and compatibility, which are differe nt from other countries and do not represent NCS core technology. In addition publication keywords correlation analysis also indicates that control system is a current research hotspot and focus  We then examine the top patent applicants and top publication institutions. As shown, the top patent applicants are mainly Japanese and German corporations, while top publication institutions mainly come from China and the USA. This divergence is logical since the nature of patents and publications is different in that patents focus on applications whereas literature researches theories and methods At the same time, we find that Japanese corporations are powerful in the NCS machine tool industry. Hence we choose the companies FANUC and MITS UBISHI as study targets Comparing SMTCL with them, based on IPC analysis, we observe that G05B19 is the main weaknessincidentally this is a part of the NCS core technology Looking at SMTCLs M&A history shows us that M&A did increase their patent portfolio and business income. We also learn that SMTCL is be hind the leading NCS-related companies in patenting, although its number 1among machine tool enterprises in the world. To make up for its weaknesses, we search for some technology acquisition candidates for SMTCL. We first download all patents related to the technology where SMTCL is lacking. Then we develop a patent filter to select a list of companies as potential targets We analyze the targets respective patent portfolios, filtering out all but 3 companies. Finally, we measure the technology synergy among the 3 companies, and analyze the similarity and complementarity between the targets and SMTCL In conclusion, we have grasped the development trends of some candidate technologies by patent data and find the disadvantages of SMTCL. To compensate for the disadvantages, we look for technology candidates for SMTCL M&A. In this paper, we have measured the knowledge relatedness to judge the matching degree between SMTCL and the candidates using patent data, whereas we havent done due diligence to make sure the core researchers still work for the target company.

As the thickest shielding studied in this work is 10 cm, it follows then that the lower energies of the incident trapped proton spectra are most affected Additionally, although the incident trapped proton spectra reach energies of up to approximately 600 MeV, the majority of the spectra are dominated by low energy protons and are thus strongly attenuated by the shielding Essentially, the increased shielding thickness has the effect of hardening the incident proton flux distribution. This result also helps explain the significant localized shielding dependencies observed in the TR model development Comparatively, the GCR spectrum includes heavy ions that reach well above GeV energies. Consequently, GCR ions can undergo spallation and fragmentation with the aluminum shielding resulting in the ejection of large amounts of nucleons and lighter ions. All these secondary particles will have energies lower than the primary incident ions but that are still quite large. In addition to this is the sheer abundance of heavy ions present in the primary and secondary flux distributions. With increasing wall thicknesses, the likelihood of spallation, fragmentation, and other resonance effects increases as well. These processes favor the increase in proton and alpha particle fluxes at low energies with thicker shielding. Above the transition points the various flux distributions decrease with increasing wall thickness suggesting they are populated by a combination of high-energy incident protons and alpha particles that penetrate through the shielding as well as heavy ions that release secondary protons and alpha particles. These fluxes will fall off, however, with the shielding thickness as the likelihood of penetration decreases Overall, when the GCR- and TR-induced distributions are summed together, the neutron component and proton component dominate the flux distribution at low energies At higher energies, the protons represent the dominant contributor to the total dose. Furthermore, at very high energies, alpha particles start to become more dominant than neutrons and their abundance becomes comparable to that of the protons. Table 6 and Table 7 detail the calculated ambient dose equivalent rates, effective dose equivalent rates and E/H  10\ios for trapped protons and GCR ions at solar maximum and minimum conditions, and for the four wall thicknesses As is detailed in Table 6, the simulated TR-induced daily ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates decrease with increasing wall thickness. The simulated values are also smaller at solar maximum conditions relative to solar minimum as expected. Next, it is useful to benchmark the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates against the TEPC dose equivalent measurements collected in 2000 and 2009 to verify the assumption that H TEPC  is approximately H  10\d moreover, to verify that the first order approximation provided by Eq. \(9\ is reasonable. The year 2000 coincides with solar maximum conditions and during this time, the ISS orbited at an altitude of 372 km to 396 km. In contrast, the year 2009 represents solar minimum conditions and the ISS orbited at an altitude of 340 km to 380 km. The measured TEPC daily dose equivalent rates at the location of Service Module Panel 327 SM-327\ged between 0.15 \226 0.2 mSv d 1 in 2000 and 0.2 \226 0.3 mSv d 1 in 2009. Comparatively, for solar maximum conditions, the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates were found to be as low as 0.094 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2  to as high as 0.42 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 hese simulated values are within a factor of two of the measured values Similarly, at solar minimum conditions, the simulated results ranged from 0.14 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 wall thickness\ 0.85 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 wall thickness\hich 


14   are again within the range of measured results, though the thinnest shielding results in a slightly more conservative estimate that is within a factor of 3. It is thus noted that a change in wall thickness does have a significant influence on the TR-induced doses. While it is unclear which of the results best approximates the ISS shielding, it is argued that the upper and lower limits of the shielding thicknesses used provide representative limits of the expected dose The simulated TR-induced effective dose equivalent rate determined by Sato et al 53 a t so l a r  mi ni mu m c o nd i t i o n s   for a wall thickness of 5.56 cm \(15 g cm 2 uminum, was estimated to be 0.144 mSv d 1 In that study, fluence-toeffective dose equivalent conversion factors for all heavy ions were used. To compare, at 10.8 g cm 2 in our study the simulated effective dose equivalent was determined to be 0.187 mSv d 1 For a wall thickness of 16.2 g cm 2 the effective dose equivalent rate was determined to be 0.127 mSv d 1 These simulated values are in good agreement with the values presented by Sato et al  d i n di cat e s t h at  the majority of the effective dose equivalent due to TR exposure is reasonably estimated considering only the neutron, proton, and alpha particle contributions. The simulated ratios of E  H  10\uctuate from 0.41 up to 0.51 for solar maximum conditions and 0.35 to 0.48 for solar minimum conditions. This ratio also appears to fall off with decreasing wall thickness. Overall, the latter results suggest that for TR exposures, the TEPC measured ambient dose equivalent offers a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent Unlike the daily TR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates, the predicted GCR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates increase with increasing wall thickness Table 7\This results due to the increased neutron, proton and alpha particle flux distributions at low energies. As expected, the daily ambient dose equivalent rates and effective dose equivalent rates are again smaller at solar maximum conditions as compared to solar minimum conditions. The measured GCR dose equivalent values in 2000 and 2009 are on the order of 300 to 400 \265Sv d 1 and 400 to 500 \265Sv d 1 respectively. In comparison, the simulated values range from 60 \265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 8 265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar maximum conditions and 100 265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 o 206 \265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar minimum conditions. These predicted values underestimate the measured ones by more than a factor of two. This can be attributed to the exclusion of the heavy-ion contributions Moreover, these results also suggest that as an operational quantity, the ambient dose equivalent is not well suited for high-energy heavy ions. This observation has also been previously suggested by Pelliccioni h o i n di cat ed t h a t  a depth greater than 10 mm would be more appropriate for higher-energy radiation and that no single depth is appropriate for all heavy ions Sato et al  o calcu late d th e eff ect iv e dos e equiv ale nt rate from GCR exposures \(including heavy ions\for a wall thickness of 15.0 g cm 2 Al to be 0.21 mSv d 1 At solar minimum conditions, the simulated effective dose equivalent rates in this study are found to be 0.13 mSv d 1  and 0.15 mSv d 1 for wall thicknesses of 10.8 g cm 2 and 16.2 g cm 2 respectively. As was the case earlier, there is again a slight discrepancy regards to those published by Sato et al 53 attrib u t ed to th e ex clu s io n o f th e h e a v y io n s   It was shown by Sato [53 th at th e co n t rib u tio n to t h e cumulative effective dose equivalent from both iron nuclei and pions are each nearly as much as the contribution alpha particles. Despite these underestimations, from the current simulations the ratios of effective-to-ambient dose equivalent are relatively constant between solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. Furthermore, unlike TR exposures, the ratios decrease from 1.19 to 0.84 with increasing shielding thickness. These results suggest that the ambient dose equivalent is roughly a 1:1 estimate of the effective dose equivalent for GCR exposures, depending on which wall thickness is assumed. However, it is again noted that the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates are underestimated so these ratios should fall below one These latter conclusions can also be verified in another manner. The total effective dose equivalent estimated by Sato et al 53 in sid e th e ISS at so lar m i n i m u m co n d itio n s   was determined to be 0.37 mSv d 1 The total dose equivalent from TR and GCR exposures measured with the TEPC at SM-327 during solar minimum conditions \(2009 is approximately 0.6 \226 0.8 mSv d 1 The ratio of the effective dose equivalent predicted by Sato to these measured TEPC values results in an effective-to-TEPC dose equivalent conversion factor of E  H TEPC of 0.5 to 0.6. This again shows that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent and can be used as an appropriate surrogate protection quantity. This conclusion is applicable to solar maximum conditions as it was shown in the simulation results that for TR exposures the E  H  10\ios are only slightly higher at solar maximum conditions and essentially remain unchanged for GCR exposures from solar maximum to solar minimum 4.6 \226 Complex Geometry Results The above transport simulations at solar minimum conditions and for wall thicknesses of 5.4 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2 were repeated using the complex geometry shown in Figure 16. Rather than determining the flux inside the entire SM, the flux distribution within the crew quarter \(SM-CQ was examined only. This area best approximates the location of SM-327. When compared to the simple cylinder simulations, the complex geometry is shown to have no effect on the simulated E  H  10\version ratios but does influence the observed ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates. The simulated values for trapped exposures are largely unchanged while for GCR exposures, the complex geometry results in a factor of two increase due to the build-up effect. Specifically, at a wall thickness of 5.4 g cm 2 the simulated ambient and effective 


15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
