ground data for optimal allocation of limited power and bandwidth resources on the ground and use smart management of competing demands for limited space assets It will also enable scalability and seamless infusion of future space and in-situ assets into the sensorweb 12 The prototype will be focused on volcano hazard monitoring at Mount St Helens which has been active since October 2004 The system is designed to be flexible and easily configurable for many other applications 
as well The primary goals of the project are 1 integrating complementary space i.e Earth Observing One EO-1 satellite and in-situ ground-based elements into an interactive autonomous sensor-web 2 advancing sensorweb power and communication resource management technology and 3 enabling scalability for seamless infusion of future space and in-situ assets into the sensorweb To meet these goals we are developing 1 a test-bed in-situ array with smart sensor nodes capable

eliminates the energy waste of idle listening Another advantage of this scheduling algorithm is the mitigation of interference between concurrent communication pairs Consequently both energy and communication efficiency are maximized A GPS receiver at every node accommodates both synchronization and deformation measurements During active periods when bandwidth demands are highest the network will prioritize the information flow in the network and reserve the bandwidth for high-priority data based on mission-needs For instance if during volcanic activity gas measurements are deemed highest priority other data may be buffered to make more bandwidth available for gas data Cluster coordinators will be able to automatically identify and select the minimum set of sensors that will provide mission critical data Bayesian network techniques will be applied to address the sensor selection problem 14 To further optimize bandwidth utilization in-situ data reduction compression and aggregation will be driven by science requirements For example when necessary seismic data typically recorded at 100Hz will be reduced by two orders of magnitude at the node level by reporting an average Real-time Seismic Amplitude Monitor RSAM parameter which is an established measurement of both earthquake and volcanic tremor 15 In addition continuous seismic data will be streamed into a buffer at each node and when seismic events are triggered the buffered waveform with precise time markers will be compressed and delivered to the control center for higher level processing Power management The main challenge facing the power management of almost all wireless networks and in particular a volcano sensor-web is striking a balance between the need for high-rate data and the desire for network longevity The smart sensor node will have a builtin ability to adjust transmission power according to local density A dynamic transmission range setting algorithm 712 will be developed to maximize energy and communication efficiency in the network which is also part of the topology management algorithm To solve the problem that the nodes closer to the gateway consume more power and might die earlier we will investigate the possibility of deploying some relay nodes to relay messages for sensors so that the sensors lifetime can be prolonged Moreover the OASIS bandwidth management scheme will have an added benefit as it will establish a timeoptimum communication schedule as well as a cooperative power schedule of sensors Since each node alternates between reception/transmission and sleep states the energy waste of idle listening and contention will be eliminated in normal operation We are currently evaluating our innovative localized TDMA MAC protocols and have shown super performances in simulations Test-bed sensor node development The staff of the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory will design prototype and test the data acquisition sensors and communication hardware for the in situ sensor nodes As part of this design process early input from geodesists and seismologists will be incorporated to ensure appropriate sensors and capabilities are included Use of commercial off-the-shelf COTS embedded microcontroller modules with high level programmability is planned to enable rapid development and application of an affordable platform An expansion circuit and printed wiring board will be designed and produced that will include power conditioning and control sensor input multiplexing signal conditioning signal digitization and communications interfaces COTS sensors will include an LI GPS receiver for timing and deformation monitoring seismic accelerometer microphone or microbarograph for infrasonic detection of explosions and emissions lightning detector for ash cloud detection and other sensors such as SO2 gas as deemed appropriate by scientific design criteria Telemetry between nodes will be IEEE 802.15.4 and 900 MHz ISM spread spectrum as appropriate for the specific link requirements In an active volcano we can not rely on solar panel for energy because it will be covered by snow in winter and erupting ash in summer In our hardware package design each station consumes less than 2W power With several Air-Alkaline batteries our network is designed to survive for one year without solar panels 5 OASIS SPACE SEGMENT The OASIS will demonstrate the benefits of a feedback between ground and space operations This capability is essential for two reasons  It will make for more efficient operation of the in-situ element  It will trigger an in-situ deployment or enhancement at an unmonitored or poorly monitored volcano and will be able to ingest input as it gradually appears online Just as the in-situ component requires a scalable architecture so will the OASIS space element be designed to accommodate future space and in-situ observations as they come on-line NASA's Earth Observing system already includes an array of sensors relevant to volcano monitoring Table 2 each with its own data system and interfaces In order to create a common interface to each of these heterogeneous systems the OASIS will develop and implement the Open Geospatial Consortium Sensorweb Enablement SWE services for space and in-situ sensors to task and acquire observation data Table 2 Current and future volcano

other in-situ sensor webs anchored in OGC SWE web service interface By unifying the OASIS data products we will enable a seamless inclusion of future space and in-situ assets SWE web service interface provides the following 1 The Sensor Planning Service SPS used to determine if a sensor observation request can be achieved re-task the sensor to acquire science data determine the status of an existing request cancel a previous request and obtain information about other OGC web services 2 The Sensor Observation Service SOS used to retrieve observation data This includes access to historical data as well as data requested and acquired from the SPS 3 The Sensor Alert Service SAS used to publish and subscribe to alerts from the sensor 4 A high level description of the sensors and their associated products and services using the Sensor Model Language SensorML 44 SensorML provides a high level description of sensors and observation processes using an XML schema methodology It also provides the functionality for users3 to discover the sensor on the web along with services to task and acquire sensor data The OASIS data management philosophy is to feed its data products into existing globally used data storage and analysis tools developed by the USGS Over the last three years the U.S Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Program has developed a suite of open-source software designed to manage and visualize volcano monitoring data VALVE is a client/server system for serving graphing and mapping nearly every type of data collected by a volcano observatory The server side of VALVE answers requests for data returning them in either graphical or numeric form The client side of VALVE is a web-based application for efficiently interacting with the server Internally all data are stored in an SQL database which provides high performance and reliability via freely available open-source software conforming to an established standard The existing USGS software suite will be extended as needed to incorporate all of the data products created as part of this project and to serve such products to clients developed for EO-1 information exchange and re-tasking requests This approach to accessing real-time volcano monitoring data promotes interoperability with data streams originating at all of the USGS domestic volcano observatories as well as international installations 8 CONCLUSIONS We will demonstrate an end-to-end system test in Mt St Helens in summer 2009 This test will consist of a 7 Users include humans as well as software agents acting as proxies for humans verification of critical operational algorithms and assessment of system components performance of a sensorweb of 15-node in-situ nodes at Mount St Helens and EOl's Hyperion spectrometer The sensor-web nodes will be packaged powered and aerially deployed in a manner developed and proven effective during the ongoing activity of Mount St Helens 17 Data acquired by the sensor-web will be integrated into a VALVE server that can be accessed in real-time by scientists as well as autonomous clients that can communicate with the space-element of OASIS via an Internet connection at the control center REFERENCES 1 The new age of Exploration NASA's Direction for 2005 and Beyond February 2005 2 HazMon A Decision-Support System to Predict and Monitor the Evolution and Effects of Natural Hazard ESTO's sponserd study by The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory Inc 3 Living on a Restless Planet Solid Earth Science Working Group Report 2002 4 Brakenridge G R S Nghiem E Anderson and S Chien Prospects for a Global Surface Water Observatory EOS Transactions of the American Geophysical Union v86 19 May 2005 5 J Kargel et al Global Land Ice Measurements from Space Program h 2006 6 Doggett T R Greeley et al 2006 Autonomous OnBoard Detection of Cryospheric Change Remote Sensing of Environment in press 7 W.-Z Song Y Wang and X.-Y Li Localized topology control in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks ACM Transactions on SensorNetworks 2006 to appear 8 W.-Z Song X.-Y Li and W Wang A unified energyefficient topology for unicast and broadcast In The Eleventh Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking MOBICOM 2005 Full version appeared in IEEE Transaction on Parallel and Distributed Systems IEEE TPDS 2006 9 W.-Z Song Y.Wang X.-Y Li and 0 Frieder Localized algorithms for energy efficient topology in wireless ad hoc networks In ACM Int Symposium on Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking and Computing MobiHoc 2004 Full version appeared in ACM/Kluwer Mobile Network and Applications ACM MONET 2006 10 X.-Y Li Y.Wang W.-Z Song P.-J.Wan and 0 Frieder Localized minimum spanning tree and its applications in wireless ad hoc networks In IEEE INFOCOM 2004 Full version appeared in IEEE Transaction on Parallel and Distributed Systems IEEE TPDS 2005 11 K Moaveninej ad W.-Z Song and X.-Y Li Robust 7
