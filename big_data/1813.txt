Mining Constrained Association Rules to Predict Heart Disease  Carlos Ordonez  Edward Omiecinski  Levien de Braal Cesar A Santana2, Norbert0 Ezquerra  Jose A Taboada3 David Cooke2 Elizabeth Krawczynska Ernest V Garcia2 College of Computing 2Radiology Department 3Departamento de Computacion Georgia Institute Emory University Universidad de Santiago of Technology Hosp ita1 Abstract This work describes our experiences on discovering 
as sociation rules in medical data to predict heart disease We focus on two aspects in this work: mapping medical data to a transaction format suitable for mining association rules and identifying useful constraints Based on these aspects we introduce an improved algorithm to discover constrained association rules We present an experimental section ex plaining several interesting discovered rules 1 Introduction Data Mining is an active research area One of the most popular approaches to do data mining is discovering associ 
ation rules  1,2 Association rules are generally used with basket, census or financial data On the other hand, medical data is generally analyzed with classifier trees clustering or regression but rarely with association rules A survey on these techniques is.found in lo In this work we analyze the idea of discovering con strained association rules in medical records that include numeric categorical, time and image data This work is based on a long time joint research effort by Georgia Tech and Emory University to discover knowledge 
in medical data to predict coronary heart disease 6 5 7 13 141 In 5 association rules are proposed and preliminary results are justified from the medical point of view In 7 neural networks are usedl to predict reversibility images based on stress and myocardial thickening images In  141 we explore the idea of constraining association rules in binary data and report preliminary findings from a data mining perspective One of the most.important features of association rules This work was 
supportedby grant LM 06726from the National Library of Medicine Compostela is that they are combinatorial in nature. This is particularly useful to discover patterns that appear in subsets of all the attributes However most patterns discovered by algorithms that do not constrain associations are not useful because they may contain redundant information may be irrelevant or describe trivial knowledge The goal is then to find those rules that are medically significant or interesting but which also have minimum support and confidence 
In our research project the discovered rules have two main purposes: validating rules used by an expert system to aid in diagnosing coronary heart disease \(PERFEX 9 61 and discovering new rules that relate patient data to heart disease and thus can enrich the expert system knowledge base At the moment all rules used by our expert system were discovered and validated by a group of domain experts as described in detail in 9 Since PERFEX is essentially a production rule system i.e composed of IF-THEN rules used in 
conjunction with temporal and uncertainty reasoning models, the discovery of knowledge resulting from associ ation rule mining would represent a potentially powerful and innovative way to validate and acquire knowledge to enhance the knowledge base. Importantly, the methods pro posed herein are capable of inferring medical knowledge from a vast array of data that includes image and alphanu meric data that represent highly relevant patient-specific clinical data \(such as electrocardiographic information, pa tient history symptoms and the results of clinical tests Hence the methods described in this paper may provide a more 
efficient knowledge acquisition technique than classi cal approaches Throughout the paper we try to provide a general frame work for understanding the approach underlying our re search We believe many of the problems we are facing small data size richness of content, high dimensionality missing information etc are likely to appear in other do mains As such this work tries to isolate those problems that we consider will be of greatest interest to the data mining 0-7695-1119-8/01 17.00 0 2001 IEEE 43 3 


community equal than some prespecified minimum support and mini mum confidence thresholds 2 1.1 Contributions and paper outline Our main contributions are the following First a jus tification is given for the use of association rules in the medical domain We explain why mining medical data for association rules is an interesting and hard problem and we present the problem in an abstract manner so that this work can be applied to other domains We introduce a simple mapping algorithm that transforms medical records into a binary format suitable to mine constrained association rules We identify important constraints to make association rules useful for the medical domain and propose an algorithm to discover constrained association rules with very low sup port and relatively high confidence Finally we identify open problems that require further research This is an outline of the rest of the paper Section 2 states the definition of association rules and describes our medical data We use a small example to motivate the use of association rules in the medical field and explain the kind of rules that are sought Section 3 addresses the problem of mapping medical data to binary attributes to be treated as items, emphasizes the main difficulties encountered using association rules and introduces useful constraints for a cus tomized A-priori type algorithm. Experimental results with medical data sets are described in Section 4 Finally, section 5 contains the conclusions of this article and directions for future research 2 Definitions data mapping and interesting rules 2.1 Association rules The standard definition of association rules I is the following Let D  TI T2    T be a set of n trans actions and let Z be a set of items Z  ill i2    Each transaction is a set of items i.e Ti 5 Z An asso ciation rule is an implication of the form X j Y where X Y C Z and X n Y  0 X is called the antecedent and Y is called the consequent of the rule In general a set of items, such as the antecedent or the consequent of a rule is called an itemset Each itemset has an associated measure of statistical significance called support For an itemset X c Z support\(X is the fraction of transactions E D such that X C Ti The support of a rule is defined as support\(X 3 Y  support\(X U Y The rule has a measure of strength called conjidence defined as the ratio confidence\(X  Y  support\(X U Y X The standard problem of mining association rules is to gen erate all rules that have support and confidence greater or 2.2 Brief literature review Literature on association rules has become extensive since their introduction in the seminal paper  11 Our work shares some similarities with 4 11 171 In  the authors propose a few algorithms that can incorporate constraints to include or exclude certain items in the association gen eration phase they focus only in two types of constraints items constrained by a certain hierarchy 15 or associa tions which include certain items This approach is limited for our purposes since we do not use hierarchies and ex cludinghncluding items is not enough to mine medically meaningful rules The work which addresses the constrain ing problem in the most general way is  1 11 Their approach based on succinctness and 2-var constraints is different as it is more query oriented and does not deal with rule semantics mapping, rule size or noisy data Bayardo et al 3 show that support and confidence are fundamental interestingness metrics 2.3 General description of our medical data The medical data set we are mining describes the pro files of patients being treated for coronary heart disease. All medical information is put in one file having several records Each record corresponds to the most relevant information of one patient This profile contains personal information such as age race smoking habits and other relevant informa tion Measurements on the patient such as weight, heart rate blood pressure and information regarding the preexis tence or existence of certain diseases are also stored The diagnostics made by a clinician or technician are included as well. Time attributes mainly involve medical history dates Then we have a complex set of measurements that estimate the degree of disease in certain regions of the heart how healthy certain regions remain and quality numbers that summarize the patient\222s heart effort under stress and relaxed conditions Finally imaging \(perfusion\information from several regions of the myocardium \(heart muscle is stored as boolean data Table 1 shows the 25 medical fields that will be used throughout this paper For each attribute we give its usual abbreviation in the medical domain its data type \(DT\what type of medical information MI it contains and a complete description. Attributes are classified into three types accord ing to the medical information they contain 222P\222 attributes correspond to perfusion measurements on specific regions of the heart 222R\222 attributes correspond to risk factors and 222D\222 attributes correspond to heart disease measurements The goal is to relate perfusion measurements and risk factors to 434

The image data represents the local degree of blood distribution \(perfusion in the heart muscle myocardium There are some fields that are commonly selected in data mining experiments. These fields include 4 fields that store the percentage of heart disease caused by a specific artery of the heart LM LAD, LCX and RCA and 9 fields that store a perfusion measurement which is a value in the range  1 11 Closer to 1 indicates a more severe per fusion defect Closer to 1 indicates absence of a perfusion defect Each of the artery fields has a value between 0 and 100 and each heart region has a value between  1 and 1 2.4 Alternative approaches Here we explain why other data mining techniques are inadequate to solve our problem Decision trees  101 pro duce rules to classify records from a data set minimizing classification error This approach assumes there is a target variable indicating the class to which each record belongs In our case it would have to be a categorical variable indi cating if the patient is healthy or sick However patients cannot be classified in such a simple way because they have a degree of sickness It could be argued that there could be several classes indicating the degree of sickness but this would have to be done for each artery making many runs and significant analysis effort mandatory. Besides this does not cover the case that the patient has combinations of diseased arteries There is even another worse drawback about deci sion trees they automatically split numerical variables. The medical community has standard cutoffs used to understand numerical variables and these cutoffs are widely accepted high blood pressure, high cholesterol, male overweight etc Therefore, the split points chosen by the decision tree may be of little use if they are different from the standard ones; experimental results interpretation becomes more dif ficult Clustering 8 10 121 is another potential technique In our case it was useful to have a global understanding of the data set However it was not adequate to produce rules relating a subset of all the variables A constrained version of clustering focusing on projections of the data could be useful but that is an aspect that deserves further research 3 Mining constrained association rules In this section we introduce our most important contri butions First we analyze the problem of mapping infor mation from categorical and numerical attribute values to items Second we identify useful constraints on attributes and items to get interesting association rules 3.1 Mapping attributes The medical data records have to be transformed into a transaction format suitable to discover association rules As noted above there are categorical, numerical, time and im age attributes To make the problem simpler all attributes are uniformly treated as categorical or numerical In nu merical attributes there is a natural order among values as opposed to categorical attributes where there does not exist such order Let Al,A2  Ap be all the attributes let R  TI r2   rn be a relation with n tuples whose values are taken from dom\(A1 x dom\(A2 x    x dom\(Ap where dom\(Ai is either a categorical or numerical domain The data set size is n and its dimensionality is p Let D  TI T2    T be a set of n transactions contain ing subsets of m items, resulting from the mapping process Items are identified by consecutive integers starting in one i.e 1,2  m The following mapping algorithm discretizes medical data records transforming numerical and categorical val ues into binary data The mapping process is divided in two phases In the first phase a mapping table M is con structed based on user\222s requirements In the second phase attribute values in each tuple rj are mapped to items based on M Each tuple rj becomes a transaction Tj suitable 435 


for association rule mining For a categorical attribute Ai each categorical value is mapped to one item If negation is desired for categorical attribute Ai then each negated value is mapped to an item The domain expert specifies k cut off points for each numerical attribute Ai producing k  1 intervals Then each interval is mapped to one item If negation is desired then k  1 additional items are created corresponding to each negated interval In general negation significantly increases the potential number of associations Therefore it must be used on a per attribute basis after careful consideration Once the M mapping table has been constructed the second phase is straightforward 3.2 Constraining association rules This is a summary of the main difficulties faced when trying to discover interesting association rules in medical data For each problem we propose a solution that is gener ally in the form of a constraint Problems are described in an abstract manner Association size Associations and rules that involve many items are hard to interpret and can potentially generate a very high number of rules. And further they slow down the interactive process by the user Therefore, there should be a default threshold for association size Most approaches are exhaustive in the sense that they find all rules above the user specified thresholds but in our domain that produces a huge amount of rules The biggest size of discovered associations is a practical bottleneck for algorithm performance In our case even k  5 produces too many rules rendering the results useless Another reason to limit size is that if there are two rules XI  Y and XZ  Y s.t X1 C X2 the first rule is more interesting because it is simpler and it is more likely to have higher support Or if YI C Y2 and X YI and X j Y2 then the 2nd rule is likely to have higher confidence but lower support Items restricted to appear only in the antecedent only in the consequent or in either place Remember that by rule definition an item appears only once in a rule and therefore it appears either in the antecedent or in the consequent of the rule Note that given the interesting rule X 3 Y no mat ter where an item appears the association X U Y must be a frequent itemset because this association is precisely the rule support but where the item appears prunes out many uninteresting rules that have useless combinations of items In other words, support is still needed to prune uninteresting associations but confidence is not enough to prune out unin teresting rules because there may be many rules having high confidence containing forbidden items in the antecedent or in the consequent Therefore items need to be constrained to appear in a specific part of the rule Associations having uninteresting combinations of items This is the case where certain combinations are known to be trivial or have such a high support that do not really say anything new about the data set Consider items ij and ij If the association XI  ij ijl is not interesting then any other association X s.t XI C X2 will not be interesting Therefore many of the items if not all can be grouped by the domain expert to discard uninteresting associations If no grouping is done then item ij is always relevant no matter which other items 1 appear together with it We assume small groups can be identified either automatically by run ning a straight association rules algorithm or by previous knowledge Low support It has been shown that support is the perfor mance bottleneck for association rules  113 It is desirable to run the algorithm once with a very low support avoiding repeated runs with decreasing supports We are interested in rules involving at least two transactions; this is a very low minimum support level High support Even though the algorithm may prune out many rules by the above criteria, since we are working with high dimensional data there may still be lots of rules involv ing a few items having a high support This problem is duly identified in  161 for quantitative association rules and it basically appears because of the high number of combina tions of partitioned intervals So this idea is helpful the algorithm should have a maximum support threshold Important constraints Based on the difficulties outlined above we introduce the following improvements Extend items with two fields in dicating constraints Let Z  il i2   im be the set of items to be mined obtained by the mapping process from the attributes AI   A Let C  CI c2   cp be a set antecedent and conse quent constraints for each attribute Aj Note that constraints are specified on attributes and not on items Each constraint cj can have one out of 3 values 1 if item Aj can only appear in the antecedent of a rule 2 if it can only appear in the consequent and 0 if it can appear in either We de fine the function antecedentlconsequent ac  R  C as ac\(Aj  cj to make reference to one such constraint Let G  91 92  gp be a set of group constraints for each attribute Aj gi is a positive integer if Aj is constrained to belong to some group or 0 if Aj is not group constrained at all We define the function group  R  G as group Aj  gj Since each attribute belongs to one group then the group numbers induce apartition on the attributes This will induce a partition on the attributes Attributes belonging to some group and attributes not constrained to belong to any group Note that if the group is  0 then there must be two or more attributes with the same group value otherwise the attribute would appear as not constrained Let X  il i2   ik be a k-itemset X is said to be 436

This number will be fixed Pruning will be based mostly on constraints.

Our experiments were run on a Sun computer Our algorithm implementation was done in the C language 4.1 Medical data set used All our experiments were based on a real data set obtained from a hospital. The data set consisted of 655 patients having 1 13 attributes We selected the 25 most important medical attributes for mining listed in table 1 So p  25 and n  655 These attributes include perfusion measurements for 9 regions of the heart and heart vessel disease for 4 vessels and attributes relating high risk factors for heart disease The perfusion measurements quantify the deviation each heart region has from the corresponding region of a normal heart The normal values for the 9 regions are taken as the means from which deviations are computed Each of the LM, LAD, LCX and RCA numerical attributes refer to vessel measurements 4.2 Setting program parameters To automatically map attributes to items we did the fol lowing The LAD RCA LCX and LM numbers repre sent the percentage of vessel narrowing and they are split 437 


into ranges as follows LAD LCX and RCA were par titioned by cutoff points 50 and 70 The 70 value indicates significant coronary disease. The 50 value indi cates borderline disease Less than 50 means the patient is considered healthy The most common cutoff value used by the cardiology community is 50 LM was partitioned by cutoff points at 30 and 50 Both the LAD and the LCX SUR were constrained to be in the same group Age Sex LAD LCX RCA were not group constrained Remem ber that combinations of items in the same group are not considered interesting 4.3 Medical significance of association rules arteries branch from the LM artery and then a defect in it is more likely to cause a larger diseased heart region That is why its cutoff values are set lower The 9 heart regions AL IL IS, AS, SI, SA, LI, LA, AP were partitioned into 2 ranges at a cutoff point of 0.2. CHOL was partitioned with cutoff points 200 warning and 250 \(high These values correspond to known medical settings. Since the clinicians were interested in getting rules involving healthy and sick patients these 4 attributes were chosen for negation Miss ing values were assigned one item but were ignored for rule generation In general we are interested in rules that involve at least two patients Obviously rules that refer to only one patient are not reliable and some of those may have 100 con fidence Then the minimum support was always fixed at 2/n M 0.2 Note that this is in fact the lowest support dis carding rules for one transaction. The minimum confidence was set at 70 The maximum support was set at 30 In the past we attempted using association rules without constraints but results were useless The number of rules went over 1 million and most of them involved the same medical variables So a post-processing approach did not work That is, mining association rules with minimum support and confidence and then filtering out unwanted rules was not practical This made constraints a required ingre dient both from a performance point of view and from a practical standpoint Note that we require a very low sup port allowing us to mine associations referring to only two transactions Now we explain what constraints were set for associa tion rule finding This set of constraints is by no means definitive or optimal but it represents what our experience has shown to be most useful Please refer to table 1 to understand the attribute meanings The constraints for the association rule mining program were set as follows The 4 main coronary arteries LM, LAD, LCX and RCA were constrained to appear in the consequent of the rule, that is ac\(i  2 All the other attributes were constrained to appear in the antecedent, i.e ac\(i  1 In other, words R Risk factors and P Perfusion Measurements\should appear in the antecedent, whereas D disease medical fields should appear in the consequent of a rule The 9 regions of the heart \(AL IS SA AP AS SI LI, IL LA were constrained to be in the same group Sex HTA HYPLPD, FHCAD Smoke and Chol were constrained to be in the same group Claudi PANGIO, PSTROKE PCAR The goal of the experiment was to relate perfusion mea surements and risk factors to vessel disease also known as stenosis to validate and improve actual diagnosis rules used by an expert system Some rules were expected confirming valid medical knowledge and some rules were surprising, having the potential to enrich the expert system knowledge base This is an analysis of our most interesting results There are two main measurements to quantify the quality of medical findings sensitivity and specificity Sensitiv ity refers to the probability of correctly identifying patients with disease. Specificity is the probability of correctly iden tifying healthy individuals These measures rely on a gold standard that is a measurement that tells with very high accuracy if the person is sick or not. Getting such ideal mea surement may involve doing invasive medical procedures on the patient In the context of this paper the gold standard was catheterization In a few cases a clinician reading was taken but in general it was not available The data mining algorithm produced a total of 2987 rules almost all having a medical significance of some sort All of them could be used in answering medical questions. Most however, were addressing issues that were not being exam ined at this time Reducing the number of rules found to the point where the results can be easily interpreted by a clinician was done in two steps The first step reduced the total number of rules to 850 This was achieved by removing rules that are in whole or in part, counter-intuitive to medical knowledge. These rules can be useful in confirming, disproving and further quanti fying what is already considered established fact. Although interesting in their own right, these investigations fall out side the scope of our present research Doing this requires filtering out combinations for specific values of the variables combined in the rules Although our extensions to the as sociation rules algorithm allow filtering out combinations of fields, this does not extend to combinations of specific values The second step reduced the number left for further ex amination down to 73 To achieve this, rules were further subdivided into categories. Examples of these categories are relating Age to CAD relating smoking habits to CAD and predicting CAD from image data In each category only the rules with the highest support andlor confidence were selected to represent the results in that category The 73 rules were analyzed by a domain expert \(clini 43 8 


cian In the following paragraphs we will discuss the most interesting rules The discovered rules were classified into 2 groups: First, those that express that if there no risk factor then there is no heart disease Second those that express that if there exists a risk factor then there is heart disease It is important to observe that the rules below involve several attributes in the antecedent or in the consequent negation and attributes being in different ranges Rules predicting no heart disease In this case new medical fields not previously included in the expert system are mined for association rules All these rules have the potential to improve the expert system In this example we can see there is less incidence of coronary disease in the patients who do not smoke and in those who have lower cholesterol. The second rule has very high sup port compared to the other rules. It states that non smokers have a lower chance of having a diseased RCA artery; note that there is the chance that some of these patients are in the 50-70 range i.e being borderline cases The fourth rule is particularly interesting as it involves two arteries in the consequent Basically if a person is young regardless of sex and does not smoke the risk for heart disease is low There are more complex rules relating two heart arteries The last two rules say that an adult female patient with no diabetes is very likely to be healthy that is, having no heart disease 1 Sei  F j O.O  LCX  50.01 s  0.229  0.728 2 Smoke  n  not\(70.0  RCA  100.1 s  0.290  0.714 3 O.O  CHOL  200.01 j not\(7O.O  LAD  lOO.l s  0.078  0.708 4 O.O  Age  40.0][Smoke  n j O.O  LCX  50.0][0.0  RCA  50.01 s  0.008  0.714 5 O.O  Age  40.0][Diab  n j O.O  LAD  50.01 s  0.027  0.818 6 0.0  Age  40.0][Diab  n j O.O  LAD  50.01 s  0.027  0.818 7 40.0  Age  60.0]and[Sez  q[Diab  n j O.O  LCX  50.01 s  0.084  0.917 8 40.0  Age  60.0]and[Sez  F][Diab  n j O.O  RCA  50.01 s  0.073  0.800 Rules predicting heart disease These rules relate risk factors to heart disease Heart disease can be detected by tomography or coronary catheterization Tomography corresponds to myocardial perfusion studies Catheterization involves inserting a tube into the coronary artery and injecting a substance to measure which regions are not well irrigated These rules characterize the patient with coronary disease There are three basic elements for analysis perfusion defect, coronary stenosis and risk fac tors Most of the rules below refer to older patients with local ized perfusion defects in specific heart regions. Rule 1 says that if the patient has a perfusion defect and had a previ ous carotid surgery then he has a high probability of having heart disease. The number of patients for this rule is low but when conditions hold the disease probability will be high These rules relate more information such as age, smoking habits cholesterol levels Rules 4,5,6 are outstanding as they confirm medical knowledge for very high risk of heart disease with high accuracy Basically if a person is old has high cholesterol levels and has a perfusion defect then it is almost sure that person has a serious heart condition All these aspects have an impact on the risk for heart disease Rules 5 and 6 state that high cholesterol levels and age are determinant factors to have a diseased RCA artery; these rules have 100 confidence Rule 11 has relatively high support and very high confidence; it relates a specific defect in a heart region SA\with a chance of having a diseased LAD artery We conclude observing that according to med ical knowledge the LAD artery has a higher chance of being diseased than the other arteries 5 As can be seen the rules that involve the LAD artery confirm this fact since they have higher support and almost 100 confidence 1 0.2  AP  I.I][PCARSUR  y  tnot\(O.0  LAD  50.0 50.0 s  0.012  0.800 2 60.0  Age  100.0][0.2  AP  l.l][Smolce  y  not\(O.O  LAD  50.0 s  0.107  0.833 3 0.2  LA  I.I][Sez  MIand\(250.0  CHOL  500.11 j not\(O.O  LCX  50.0  0.014  0.750 4 60.0  Age  100.0][0.2  IL  1.1][250.0  CHOL  500.1 j not\(O.O  RCA  50.0 s  0.017  0.917 5 60.0  Age  100.0][0.2  IS  1.0][250.0  CHOL  500.1 j not\(O.O  RCA  50.0 s  0.015  1.000 6 60.0  Age  100.0][0.2  IS  1.0][250.0  CHOL  500.11 j not\(O.O  RCA  50.0 s  0.015  1.OOO 7 60.0  Age  100.0][0.2  SA  I.O][FHCAD  y 3 not\(O.O  LAD  50.0  0.015  1.000 8 0.2  SA  I.O]and[PANGIO  y j not\(O.O  LAD  50.0  0.023  0.938 9 60.0  Age  100.0][0.2  AP  l.I][Sez  F 3 not\(O.O  LAD  50.0  0.049  0.941 10 60.0  Age  100.0][0.2  SA  I.O][Claudi  y j not\(O.O  LAD  50.0  0.029  0.950 11 60.0  Age  100.0][0.2  SA  I.O][HYPLPD  y j not\(O.O  LAD  50.0  0.070  0.939 439 


5 Conclusions This article presented our experiences mining associa tion rules from medical data to predict heart disease We explained the motivation and validity of using association rules on medical data Association rules are useful for our purpose given their combinatorial nature We described all information contained in medical records We introduced a simple mapping algorithm to transform medical records to a transaction format We then presented an improved algo rithm to mine constrained association rules Medical data records contain numerical categorical, time and image at tributes The mapping algorithm uniformly treats attributes as numerical or categorical Numerical attributes are split into intervals Negation is used on a per attribute basis to avoid an explosion in the number of associations A map ping table is constructed and based on this table attribute values are mapped to items The algorithm to mine asso ciation rules uses several important constraints to reduce the number of rules and speed up the mining process It uses a constraint to exclude combinations of attributes elim inating trivial or useless associations Certain attributes are constrained to appear only in the antecedent, only in the con sequent or in both to get medically meaningful rules Rules are constrained to include a maximum number of items to make them simpler and more general Maximum support is a constraint used to eliminate trivial rules These constraints allowed us to mine medical records at a minimum support involving only two transactions The experimental section discussed several important association rules predicting ab sence or presence of heart disease We would like to examine problems with missing information more closely We want to identify other useful constraints besides grouping and antecedentlconsequent We want to compare the discovered association rules with classification rules obtained by a decision tree algorithm We plan to process the data with a clustering algorithm  121 to explain why certain rules have low confidence and to find high con fidence rules in subsets of medical records Finally, we want to assess the impact on performance of each constraint This is a summary of issues for future research References  11 Rakesh Agrawal Tomasz Imielinski and Arun Swami Min ing association rules between sets of items in large databases In ACM SIGMOD Conference pages 207-2 16,1993  Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases In VLDB Conference 1994 interesting rules In ACM KDD Conference 1999 3 Roberto Bayardo and Rakesh Agrawal Mining the most 4 Roberto Bayardo Rakesh Agrawal and D Gounopolos Constraint-based rule mining in large dense databases In IEEE ICDE Conference 1999 5 David Cooke, Carlos Ordonez Ernest V Garcia Edward Omiecinski, Elyzabeth Krawczynska, Russell Folks, Cesar Santana Levien de Braal and Norberto Ezquerra Data min ing of large myocardial perfusion spect mps databases to improve diagnostic decision making Journal of Nuclear Medicine 40\(5 1999 6 David Cooke Cesar Santana Tahia Moms Levien de Braal Carlos Ordonez Edward Omiecinski Norberto Ezquerra and Ernest V Garcia Validating expert system rule con fidences using data mining of myocardial perfusion spect databases In Computers in Cardiology Conference 2000 7 Levien de Braal Norberto Ezquerra E Schwartz and Ernest V Garcia.

of the query expression without ha ving the global view of the in ten tion There is a big c hance that the enco ded pro cedure ma y not b e the b est w a y to compute the rules dep ending on the database instance F urthermore as w e understand it their prop osals require p oten tially large n um ber of name generation for relations and attributes The names that are needed are usually database dep enden t and th us p ossibly cannot b e gathered at query time An additional pro cess needs to b e completed to gather those v ariables b efore actual computations can b egin 5  9 Optimization Issues While it w as in tellectually c hallenging to dev elop a declarativ e expression for asso ciation rule mining from deductiv e databases there are sev eral op en issues with great promises for resolution In the w orst case the least xp oin tneedsto generate n 2 tuples in the rst pass alone when the database size is n  Theoretically  this can happ en only when eac h transaction in the database pro duces an in tersection no de and when they are not related b y subset-sup erset relationship In the second pass w e need to do n 4 computations and so on The question no w is can w e a v oid generating and p erhaps scanning some of these com binations as they will not lead to useful in tersections F or example the no de b 0 3 in gure 11 is redundan t A signican t dierence with apriori lik e systems is that our system generates all the item sets top do wn in the lattice without taking their candidacy as a large item set in to consideration Apriori on the other hand do es not generate an y no de if their subsets are not large item sets themselv es and thereb y prunes a large set of no des Optimization tec hniques that exploit this so called an ti-monotonicit y prop ert y of item set lattices similar to apriori could mak e all the dierence in our setup The k ey issue w ould b e ho ww e push the selection threshold minim um supp ort inside the top do wn computation of the no des in the lattice in our metho d F or the momen t and for the sak e of this discussion let us consider a higher supp ort threshold of 60 for the database T of gure 9 No w the l-en v elop e will b e the one sho wn in ligh ter dashed lines in gure 11 and the no des under this line will b e the large item sets Notice that no ww eha v eto discard no des ad 2 0 and d 0 2 to o This raises the question is it p ossible to utilize the supp ort and condence thresholds pro vided in the query and prune candidates for in tersection an y further Ideas similar to magic sets transformation 3  24 ma y be b orro w ed to address this issue The only problem is that pruning of an y no de dep ends on its supp ort coun t whic h ma y come at a later stage By then all no des ma y already ha v e b een computed and th us pushing selection conditions inside aggregate op erator ma y b ecome non-trivial Sp ecial data structures and indexes ma y also aid in dev eloping faster metho ds to compute ecien t interse ction joins that w e ha v e utilized in this pap er W e lea v e these questions as op en issues that should be tak en up in the future F ortunately though there has been a v ast b o dy of researc h in optimizing Datalog programs including recursiv e programs suc h as the one w e ha v e used in this pap er and hence the new questions and researc h 5 Recall that their prop osal requires one to express the mining problem to the system using sev eral queries and up date statemen ts that utilizes information ab out the database con ten ts to ac hiev e its functionalit y  c hallenges that this prop osal raises for declarativ e mining ma y exploit some of these adv ances Needless to emphasize a declarativ e metho d preferably a formal one is desirable b ecause once w e understand the functioning of the system w e will then be able to select appropriate pro cedures dep ending on the instances to compute the seman tics of the program whic hw e kno wis in tended once w e establish the equiv alence of declarativ e and pro cedural seman tics of the system F ortunately  w e ha v e n umerous pro cedural metho ds for computing asso ciation rules whic h complemen t eac h other in terms of sp eed and database instances In fact that is what declarativ e systems or declarativit y buy us  a c hoice for the most ecien t and accurate pro cessing p ossible 10 Conclusion Our primary goal for this pap er has b een to demonstrate that mining asso ciation rules from an y rst-order kno wledge base is p ossible in a declarativ ew a y  without help from an y sp ecial to ols or mac hinery  and that w e can no wha v ea v ery in tuitiv e and simple program to do so W eha v esho wn that it is indeed p ossible to mine declarativ ekno wledge b y exploiting the existing mac hinery supp orted b ycon temp orary inference engines in programming languages e.g Prolog or kno wledge base systems e.g RelationLog XSB LD L  CORAL All w e require is that the engine b e able to supp ort set v alued terms grouping aggregate functions and set relational op erators for comparison functionalities whic hmostofthesesystemscurren tly supp ort W e ha v e also demonstrated that our formalism is grounded on a more mathematical foundation with formal prop erties on whic h the seman tics of the R ULES system rely  W e ha v e also raised sev eral op en issues related to eciency and query optimization whic h should b e our next order of business As future researc h w e plan to dev elop optimization tec hniques for mining queries that require non-trivial lo ok ahead and pruning tec hniques in aggregate functions The dev elopmen ts presen ted here also ha v e other signican t implications F or example it is no w p ossible to compute c hi square rules 4 using the building blo c ks pro vided b y our system Declarativ e computation of c hi square rules to our kno wledge has nev er b een attempted for the man y pro cedural concepts the computation of c hi square metho d relies on In a separate w ork 2 w e sho w that the coun ting metho d prop osed in this pap er can be eectiv ely utilized to generate the exp ectations needed in order to compute suc h rules rather easily  These are some of the issues w e plan to address in the near future The motiv ation imp ortance and the need for in tegrating data mining tec hnology with relational databases has b een addressed in sev eral articles suc h as 12  13 They con vincingly argue that without suc h in tegration data mining tec hnology ma y not nd itself in a viable p osition in the y ears to come T o b e a successful and feasible to ol for the analysis of business data in relational databases suc htec hnology m ust b e made a v ailable as part of database engines and as part of its declarativ e query language Our prop osal for declarativ e mining bears merit since it sheds ligh t on ho w rst order databases can be mined in a declarativ e and pro cedure indep enden t w a y so that the optimization issues can b e delegated to the underlying database engine Once suc h argumen ts are accepted sev eral systems 9 


related issues b ecome prime candidates for immediate atten tion F or example traditionally database systems supp orted declarativ e querying without the necessit y to care ab out the pro ceduralit y of the queries In this pap er w eha v e actually demonstrated that asso ciation rule mining can b e view ed as a Datalog query  It is immediate that a direct mapping from the Datalog expressions presen ted in this pap er to SQL can be dev elop ed with no problem at all W e can then rely on ecien t database pro cessing of the query in an optimized fashion Hence w ecomeclose to the essence of the visions expressed b y the leading database researc hers and practioners 12  References 1 Rak esh Agra w al and Ramakrishnan Srik an t F ast algorithms for mining asso ciation rules in large databases In VLDB  pages 487{499 1994 2 Anon ymous A declarativ e metho d for mining c hisquare rules from deductiv e databases T ec hnical rep ort Departmen t of Computer Science Anon ymous Univ ersit y USA F ebruary 2001 3 C Beeri and R Ramakrishnan On the po w er of magic In Pr o c e e dings of the 6th A CM Symp osium on Principles of Datab ase Systems  pages 269{283 1987 4 Sergey Brin Ra jeev Mot w ani and Craig Silv erstein Bey ond mark et bask ets Generalizing asso ciation rules to correlations In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 265 276 1997 5 D Chimen ti et al The LD L system protot yp e IEEE Journal on Data and Know le dge Engine ering  2\(1 90 1990 6 Jia w ei Han Jian P ei and Yiw en Yin Mining frequen t patterns without candidate generation In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 1{12 2000 7 Marcel Holsheimer Martin L Kersten Heikki Mannila and Hann uT oiv onen A p ersp ectiv e on databases and data mining In Pr o c of the sixth A CM SIGKDD Intl Conf  pages 150{155 Mon treal Queb ec 1995 8 Flip Korn Alexandros Labrinidis Y annis Kotidis and Christos F aloutsos Ratio rules A new paradigm for fast quan tiable data mining In Pr o c of 24th VLDB  pages 582{593 1998 9 Brian Len t Arun N Sw ami and Jennifer Widom Clustering asso ciation rules In Pr o c of the 3th ICDE  pages 220{231 1997 10 Mengc hi Liu Relationlog At yp ed extension to datalog with sets and tuples In John Llo yd editor Pr oc e e dings of the 12th International L o gic Pr o gr amming Symp osium  pages 83{97 P ortland Oregon Decem ber 1995 MIT Press 11 Rosa Meo Giusepp e Psaila and Stefano Ceri An extension to SQL for mining asso ciation rules Data Mining and Know le dge Disc overy  2\(2 1998 12 Amir Netz Sura jit Chaudh uri Je Bernhardt and Usama M F a yy ad In tegration of data mining with database tec hnology  In Pr o c e e dings of 26th VLDB  pages 719{722 2000 13 Amir Netz Sura jit Chaudh uri Usama M F a yy ad and Je Bernhardt In tegrating data mining with SQL databases In IEEE ICDE  2001 14 Ra ymond T Ng Laks V S Lakshmanan Jia w ei Han and Alex P ang Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained asso ciation rules In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 13{24 1998 15 Jong So o P ark Ming-Sy an Chen and Philip S Y u An eectiv e hash based algorithm for mining asso ciation rules In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 175{186 1995 16 Karthic k Ra jamani Alan Co x Bala Iy er and A tul Chadha Ecien t mining for asso ciation rules with relational database systems In Pr o c e e dings of the International Datab ase Engine ering and Applic ations Symp osium  pages 148{155 1999 17 R Ramakrishnan D Sriv asta v a and S Sudarshan CORAL  Con trol Relations and Logic In Pr o c of 18th VLDB Confer enc e  pages 238{250 1992 18 Konstan tinos F Sagonas T errance Swift and Da vid Scott W arren XSB as an ecien t deductiv e database engine In Pr o c of the A CM SIGMOD Intl Conf  pages 442{453 1994 19 Sunita Sara w agi Shib y Thomas and Rak esh Agra w al In tegrating mining with relational database systems Alternativ es and implications In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 343{354 1998 20 Ashok a Sa v asere Edw ard Omiecinski and Shamk an tB Nav athe An ecien t algorithm for mining asso ciation rules in large databases In Pr o c of 21th VLDB  pages 432{444 1995 21 Pradeep Sheno y  Ja y an t R Haritsa S Sudarshan Gaura v Bhalotia Ma y ank Ba w a and Dev a vrat Shah T urb o-c harging v ertical mining of large databases In A CM SIGMOD  pages 22{33 2000 22 Abraham Silb ersc hatz Henry F Korth and S Sudarshan Datab ase System Conc epts  McGra w-Hill third edition 1996 23 Shib y Thomas and Sunita Sara w agi Mining generalized asso ciation rules and sequen tial patterns using SQL queries In KDD  pages 344{348 1998 24 J D Ullman Principles of Datab ase and Know le dgeb ase Systems Part I II  Computer Science Press 1988 25 Mohammed J Zaki Generating non-redundan t association rules In Pr o c of the 6th A CM SIGKDD Intl Conf  Boston MA August 2000 1 0
