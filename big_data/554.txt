 4 4 4 5 S 7 1 INTRODUCTION Scattered data interpolation is a problem of interest in numerous areas such as electronic imaging smooth surface modeling and computational geometry  1 2 Our motivation arises from applications in geology and mining which often involve large scattered data sets and a demand for high accuracy For such cases the method of choice is ordinary kriging 3 This is because it is a best unbiased estimator 3-5 Also in re mote 
sensing image fusion of multi-sensor data is often used to increase either the spectral or the spatial resolution of the U.S Government work not protected by U.S copyright This work was done when Nargess Memarsadeghi and Vikas C Raykar were graduate students in Computer Science Department of the University of Maryland at College Park The work of D M 
Mount has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant CCR-0635099 images involved 6 7 A generalized version of the ordinary kriging called cokriging 3 5 can be used for image fusion of multi-sensor data 8 9 Unfortunately ordinary kriging 
interpolant is computationally very expensive to compute exactly For n scattered data points computing the value of a single interpolant involves solving a dense linear system of order n x n which takes O\(n3 This is infeasible for large n Traditionally kriging is solved approximately by local approaches that are based on considering only a relatively small number of points that lie close to the query point 3,5 There are many problems with this local approach however The first is that determining the proper neighborhood size is tricky and is usually solved by ad hoc methods such as 
selecting a fixed number of nearest neighbors or all the points lying within a fixed radius Such fixed neighborhood sizes may not work well for all query points depending on local density of the point distribution 5 Local methods also suffer from the problem that the resulting interpolant is not continuous Meyer showed that while kriging produces smooth continuous surfaces it has zero order continuity along its borders 10 Thus at interface boundaries where the neighborhood changes the interpolant behaves discontinuously Therefore it is important to consider and solve the global system for each interpolant However solving 
such large dense systems for each query point is impractical Recently an approximation approach to kriging has been proposed based on a technique called covariance tapering 11 12 However this approach is not efficient when covariance models have relatively large ranges Also finding a valid taper as defined in 11L for different covariance functions is difficult and at times impossible e.g Gaussian covariance model In this paper we address the shortcomings of the previous approaches through an alternative based on Fast Multipole Methods FMM The FMM was first introduced by Greengard and Rokhlin for fast multiplication 
of a structured matrix by a vector 13 14 If the Gaussian function is used for generating the matrix entries the matrix-vector product is called the Gauss transformn We use efficient implementations of the Gauss transform based on the FMM idea see  1 5,16 in combination with the SYMMLQ iterative method 17 for solving large ordinary kriging systems Billings et at 18 had also suggested the use of iterative methods in combination with the FMM for solving such systems The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 1 


2 describes the ordinary kriging system and solving it via an iterative method In Section 3 we introduce the matrix-vector products involved in solving such systems We mention two existing efficient and approximate implementations of such products in Section 4 Section 5 describes our data sets Our experiments and results are presented in Sections 6 and 7 respectively Section 8 concludes this paper 2 ORDINARY KRIGING VIA ITERATIVE METHODS Kriging is an interpolation method named after Danie Krige a South African mining engineer 5 Kriging and its variants have been traditionally used in mining and geostatistics applications 3-5 Kriging is also referred to as the Gaussian process predictor in the machine learning domain 19 The most commonly used variant is called ordinairy kriging which is often referred to as a Best Linear Unbiased Estimator BLUE 3 1 1L It is considered to be best because it minimizes the variance of the estimation error It is linear because estimates are weighted linear combination of available data and is unbiased since it aims to have the mean error equal to zero 3 Minimizing the variance of the estimation error forms the objective function of an optimization problem Ensuring unbiasedness of the error imposes a constraint on this function Forrmalizing this objective function with its constraint results in the following system 3 5 12  LT  Co  1 method requires one O\(T 2 matrix-vector multiplication per iteration The storage is 0\(n since the matrix-vector multiplication can use elements computed on the fly without storing the matrix Empirically the number of iterations required k is generally small compared to n leading to a computational cost of O\(kn 2 3 MATRIX-VECTOR MULTIPLICATION The 0\(kn 2 quadratic complexity is still too high for large data sets The core computational step in each SYMM LQ iteration involves the multiplication of a matrix C with some vector say q For the Gaussian covariance model the entries of the matrix C are of the form C]i4  exp 3 xi2 a2 Hence the jth element of the matrix-vector product Cq can be written as Cq   qE exp 3 xi 2 a2 which is the weighted sum of n Gaussians each centered at xi and evaluated at x Discrete Gauss transform GT The sum of multivariate Gaussians is known as the discrete Gauss transform in scientific computing In general for each targetpoint Yi 243 PRd}7 which in our case are the same as the source points xi the discrete Gauss transform is defined as G\(yj  qie i=l 1 where C is the matrix of points pairwise covariances L is a column vector of all ones and of size  and w is the vector of weights wi    wr Therefore the minimization problem for a points reduces to solving a linear system of size n  1 which is impractical for very large data sets via direct approaches It is also important that matrix C be positive definite 3 12 Pairwise covariances are often modeled as a function of points separation These functions should result in a positive definite covariance matrix Christakos 20 showed necessary and sufficient conditions for such permissible covariance functions Two of these valid functions are the Gaussian and Spherical covariance functions 3,5,20 In this paper the Gaussianu covariance function is used For two points xi and xj the Gaussian covariance function is defined as Cij  exp 3 lzxi2 a2 where a is the range of the covariance function For large data sets it is impractical to solve the ordinary kriging system using direct approaches that take 0\(n3 time It erative methods generate a sequence of solutions which converge to the true solution in n iterations In practice however we loop over k a n iterations 21 In particular we used an iterative method called SYMMLQ which is appropriate for solving symmetric systems 1L7 Note that the coefficient matrix in the ordinary kriging linear system while symmetric is not positive definite since it has a zero entry on its diagonal Therefore methods such as conjugate gradient are not applicable here 22 The actual implementation of the SYMMLQ 2 where h in our case h  a/3 is called the bandwidth of the Gaussian Evaluating discrete Gauss transforms for art target points due to n different source locations arises in may applications In this paper the Gauss transform GT refers to this direct implementation which takes 0\(mn time 4 FAST APPROXIMATE MATRIX-VECTOR MULTIPLICATION Various fast approximation algorithms  15,23 have been proposed to compute the discrete Gauss transform in 0\(m  n time These algorithms compute the sum to any arbitrary c precision For any e  0 we define C to be an E-exact approximation to G if the maximum absolute error relative to the total weight Q  qi q is upper bounded by E i e max G\(yj yj vi Q C 3 The constant in 0\(Tri na depends on the desired accuracy c which however can be arbitrary At machine precision there is no difference between the direct and the fast methods The method relies on retaining only the first few terms of an infi nite series expansion for the Gaussian function These methods are inspired by the fast multipole methods FMM originally developed for the fast summation of the potential fields generated by a large number of sources such as those arising in gravitational potential problems 13  The fast Gauss transform FGT is a special case where FMM ideas were used for 2 


on the target coordinates yj However for the third exponential 2432\(yj x xi-x the are entangled The the Gaussian potential 23 The improved fast Gauss transform IFGT is a similar algorithm based on a single different factorization and data structure It is suitable for higher dimensional problems and provides comparable performance in lower dimensions  15 Improvedfast Gauss transform IFGT IFGT is an efficient algorithm for approximating the Gauss transform The fast Gauss transform first proposed by Greengard and Strain 23 is an E-exact approximation algorithm for the Gauss transform This algorithm reduces the Gauss transform's computational complexity from O\(MTI to O\(m  n However this algorithm's constant factor grows exponentially with dimension d Later improvements including the IFGT algorithm reduced this constant factor to asymptotically polynomial order in terms of d The IFGT algorithm was first introduced by Yang et al 15 Their implementation did not use a sufficiently tight error bound to be useful in practice Also they did not adaptively select the necessary parameters to achieve the desired error bound Raykar et al later presented an approach that overcame these shortcomings 16,24 We used the implementation due to Raykar et al We briefly describe some of the key ideas in IFGT Please see 1L6,24 for more details For any point x\243 C lRd the Gauss Transform at yj can be written as 5 Rearranging the terms Equation 5 can be written as G\(yj 2E  2 E lx z l lael<p-l i=l L Cll e y j x y lKl<p l h h  12Ih 2 h X h  where cc  qie 243 12 h X zi 243 a X h The coefficients C can be evaluated separately in 0\(n Evaluation of G\(yj at m points is 0\(m Hence the computational cost has reduced from the quadratic 0\(nrm to the linear 0\(n  m We have omitted the constants in the computational cost A detailed analysis of the cost can be seen in 16,24 G yj E qi  i=l n rl qic i=l Z qi1e  Ij e IIyj  error E Ignoring error terms can be approximated as GK IC elX,_X 112 22 e-IYj _X 112 2x as 16,24 243   h  h v 0 source coordinates xi The second exponential e/h depends only for now G\(yj a ao loal<p-l source and target can be writ ten on the crux of the algorithm is to separate this entanglement via Taylor series using multi-index notation The p-term truncated Taylor series expansion for e2  the truncation number p is chosen based on the prescribed 11 2\(ty.j-x e,2 4 In FEquation 4 the first exponential inside the summation ez*l/h2 depends only i=1 Thus far we have used the Taylor series expansion about a certain point x\243 However if we use the same x\243 for all the points we typically would require very high truncation number since the Taylor series is valid only in a small open ball around x The IFGT algorithm uses a data adaptive space partitioning scheme-the farthest point clustering algorithm 25]-to divide the a sources into K spherical clustersand then build a Taylor series at the center of each cluster The final algorithm has four stages The first stage involves determining parameters of the algorithm based on specified error bounds bandwidth and data distribution Second the d-dimensional space is subdivided using a k-center clustering 25 Next a truncated representation of the Gaussian inside each cluster is built using a set of decaying basis functions Finally the influence of all the data in a neighborhood using coefficients at cluster centers are collected and the approximate GT is evaluated Please see  16 24 for details GT with nearest neighbors GTANN GTANN is also an efficient algorithm for calculating matrixvector products This method was implemented by Raykar 26 where it is referred to as the FigTree method This method is most effective when the Gaussian models being used have small ranges while IFGT gives good speed-ups when dealing with large range values First based on the desired error bound a search radius is calculated Then for each target point source points within that radius are considered Since the Gaussian function dissipates very rapidly nearby points have the greatest influence These 2  yi x a Xi X a a h h Ial<-P-l 


source points are calculated via fixed-radius nearest neighbor search routines of the ANN library 27 Finally for each target point their nearest neighbor source points are calculated in matrix-vector product calculations involving the covariance matrix C in the ordinary kriging system 5 DATA SETS We generated three sets of sparse data sets For the first set the number of sampled points varied from 1000 up to 5000 while their covariance model had a small range value of 12 For the second set we varied the number of samples in the same manner except that the points covariance model had a larger range equal to 100 Finally we sampled 5000 points from dense grids where points covariance model had ranges equal to a  12 24,100 250 and 500 For each input data set we use 200 query points which are drawn from the same dense grid but are not present in the sampled data set One hundred of these query points were sampled uniformly from the original grids The other 100 query points were sampled from the same Gaussian distributions that were used in the generation of a small percentage of the sparse data 6 EXPERIMENTS We used the SYMMLQ iterative method as our linear solver We set the desired solutions relative error or the convergence criteria for the SYMMVLQ method to 62  10-3 Thus if SYMMLQ is implemented exactly we expect the relative error to be less than 10-3 The exact error is likely to be higher than that We developed three versions of the ordinary kriging interpolator each of which calculates the matrix-vector products involved in the SY MMLQ method differently Gauss Transform GT Computes the matrix-vector product exactly Improved Fast Gauss Transform IFG T Approximates the matrix-vector product to the e precision via the IFGT method mentioned in Section 4 Gauss transform with nearest neighbors GTANN Approximates the matrix-vector product using the GTANN method mentioned in Section 4 All experiments were run on a Sun Fire V20z running Red Hat Enterprise release 3 using the g compiler version 3.2.3 Our software is implemented in C and uses the Geostatistical Template Library GsTL 28 and Approximate Nearest Neighbor library ANN 27 GsTL is used for building and solving the ordinary kriging systems and ANN is used for finding nearest neighbors when using the GTANN approach In all cases for the IFGT and GTANN ap proaches we required the approximate matrix-vector products to be evaluated within e 10 accuracy All experiments results are averaged over five runs We designed three experi ments to study the effect of covariance ranges and number of data points on performances of our different ordinary kriging versions Experiment 1 We varied number of scattered data points from 1000 up to 5000 with a small fixed Gaussian covariance model of range a  12 Experiment 2 We varied number of sampled points This time points had a larger range equal to a  100 for their covariance model Experiment 3 Finally we examined the effect of different covariance ranges equal to a  12 25 100 250 and 500 on a fixed data set of size 5000 7 RESULTS In this section we compare both the quality of results and the speed-ups achieved for solving the ordinary kriging system via iterative methods combined with fast approximate matrixvector multiplication techniques Figure 1 presents results of the first experiment mentioned When utilizing approximate methods IFGT and GTANN the exact residuals are comparable to those obtained from GT The IFGT approach gave speed-ups ranging from 1.3-7.6 while GTANN resulted in speed-ups ranging roughly from 50150 This is mainly due to the fact that the covariance function's range is rather small Since there are only a limited number of source points influencing each target point collecting and calculating the influence of all source points for each target point the IFGT approach is excessive The GTANN approach works well for such cases by considering only the nearest source points to each target point In both cases the speed-ups grow with number of data points Algorithms perform similarly for points from the Gaussian distribution to those from uniform distribution Figure 2 shows results of the second experiment While the GTANN approach did not result in significant speed-ups the IFGT gave constant factor speed-ups ranging roughly from 1.5 to 7.5 as we increased the number of data points The IFGT approach results in larger residuals for small data sets and when solving the ordinary kriging system for query points from the uniform distribution In particular for n  1000 andd n  2000 the performance of IFGT is not acceptable with respect to the exact residuals calculated This poor overall result for these cases is because the SYMM[LQ method did not meet its convergence criteria and reached maximum number of iterations Increasing the required accuracy for the IFGT algorithm by changing the e  10-4 to 10-6 resolved this issue and gave residuals comparable to those obtained from the GT method As the number of points increases the quality of results approaches those of the exact methods For the query points from the Gaussian distribution the quality of results are comparable to the exact method when using the IFGT approach The GTANN approach also results in compa rable residuals to the exact methods in all cases Figure 3 presents results of the last set of experiments In all cases the quality of results is comparable to those obtained from exact methods The IFGT approach resulted in speedups of 7-15 in all cases The GTANN approach is best when 4 


used for covariance functions with small range values of 12 and 25 While the GTANN approach is slower than the exact methods for range values larger than 100 it results in speedup factors of 151 53 and 47-49 for range values 12 and 25 respectively Thus the GTANN approach is efficient for small range values and so is the IFGT approach for large ranges 8 CONCLUSIONS We integrated efficient implementations of the Gauss Transform for solving ordinary kriging systems We examined the effect of number of points and the covariance functions ranges on the running time for solving the system and the quality of results The IFGT is more effective as number of data points increases Our experiments using the IFGT approach for solving the ordinary kriging system demonstrated speed-up factors ranging from 7-15 when using 5000 points Based on our tests on varying number of data points we expect even higher speed-up factors compared to the exact method when using larger data sets In almost all cases the quality of IFGT results are comparable to the exact methods The GTANN approach outperfornned the IFGT method for small covariance range values resulting in speed-up factors as high as 153 and 49 respectively The GTANN approach is slower than the exact methods for large ranges 100 and over in our experiments and thus is not recommended for such cases The quality of results for GTANN was comparable to the exact methods in all cases Please see 26 29 for details of methods used in this work Future work involves efficient kriging via fast approximate matrix-vector products for other covariance functions where a factorization exists We also plan on using preconditioners 2 1  for our iterative solver so that the approximate versions converge faster and we obtain even higher speed-ups REFERENCES 1 I Amidror Scattered data interpolation methods for electronic imaging systems A survey Journal of Electronic Imaging vol I 1 no 2 pp 157-176 April 2002 2 P Alfeld Scattered data interpolation in three or more variables Mathematical methods in computer aided geometric design pp 1-33 1989 3 E H Isaaks and R M Srivastava An Introduction to Applied Geostatistics New York Oxford Oxford University Press 1989 4 A G Journel and C J Huijbregts Mining Geostatistics New York Academic Press Inc 1978 5 P Goovaerts Geostatistics for Natural Resources Evaluation New York Oxford Oxford University Press 1997 6 D L Hall Mathematical techniques in multisensor data fusion Norwood Artech House Inc 1992 7 Y Zhang Understanding image fusion Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing pp 657-661 June 2004 8 N Memarsadeghi J L Moigne D M Mount and J Morisette A new approach to image fusion based on cokriging in the Eighth International Conference on Information Fusion vol 1 July 2005 pp 622-629 9 N Memarsadeghi J L Moigne and D M Mount Image fusion using cokriging in IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS'06 July 2006 pp 2518 2521 10 T H Meyer The discontinuous nature of kriging interpolation for digital terrain modeling Cartography and Geographic Information Science vol 3 1 no 4 pp 209-216,2004  1 R Furrer M G Genton and D Nychka Covariance taperincg for interpolation of large spatial datasets Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics vol 15 no 3 pp 502-523 September 2006 12 N Memarsadeghi and D M Mount Efficient implementation of an optimal interpolator for large spatial data sets in Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Science ICCS'07 ser Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol 4488 SpringerVerlag May 2007 pp 503 510 13 L Greengard and V Rokhlin A fast algorithm for particle simulation Journal of Computational Physics vol 73 no 2 pp 325-348 1987 14 L Greengard The rapid evaluation of potential fields in particle systems Ph.D dissertation Yale NYU 1987 15 C Yang R Duraiswami and L Davis Efficient kernel machines using the improved fast Gauss transform in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems L K Saul Y Weiss and L Bottou Eds vol 17 MIT Press 2005 pp 1561-1568 16 V C Raykar C Yang R Duraiswami and N Gumerov Fast computation of sums of Gaussians in high dimensions Department of Computer Science University of Maryland College Park MD 20742 Tech Rep 2005 CS-TR-4767 17 C C Paige and M A Saunders Solution of sparse indefinite systems of linear equations SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis vol 12 no 4 pp 617-629 September 1975 18 S D Billings R K Beatson and G N Newsamm Interpolation of geophysical data using continuous global surfaces Geophysics vol 67 no 6 pp 1810-1822 NovemberDecember 2002 19 C E Rasmussen and C K I Williams Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning MIT Press 2006 20 G Christakos On the problem of permissible covariance and variogram models Water Resources Research vol 20 no 2 pp 251-265 February 1984 5

used to match the type of the play and Java functions extracted the specific information However to be useful this information must be matched with the ontology To this end the type of play was translated into a specific subclass of the PlayType class while the context of the play was used to determine the appropriate subclass of the Play class and to fill in the properties of these two classes The names of the players involved in the play were used to find the actual instances of the specified Player in the ontology taken from the roster files By reading the rosters and creating the teams first we can leverage the actors in this way when ontologizing the events of the game This helps protect the validity of the data by ensuring that all references to an individual actor refer to the same entity regardless of how they are referred to in individual events This point is best clarified with an example To use the previous example from the Boise St vs Oklahoma game by referring back to the input files we ensure that all references in the play-by-play to Jared Zabransky Zabranksy number 5 for Boise St or any other tangent reference to a property are referring to the same Player in the ontology Maintaining data integrity in this way goes to the heart of using an ontology which strives to eliminate all reference ambiguity in the data The final step established above for ontologizing the data was to write the data to permanent storage The necessity of performing this step is predicated upon whether a database connection was established in the beginning or not In the early development of both domains we represented the ontology using Jena s memory model which stores the model and its associated triples in memory However given that combat simulations can produce many gigabytes of data with the number ever growing an alternative was required as every time the program was run with the memory model it crashed due to running out of heap space As Figure 2 suggests establishing a database connection quickly became one of the few viable options Towards these ends an Oracle lOg database was used to house the data due to Oracle's commitment in the 10g and the subsequent release of the 1 Ig to store RDF triples uniquely as opposed to performing a conversion to a traditional relational database every time Putting the information into the database had the desired benefit of greatly expanding the constraint on file size Additionally once the database was established optimizations could be performed on the data storage to improve the access speeds of common queries By putting the information in a sufficiently large database parsing becomes a truly one-time expense where it never has to be repeated If a database is used the program no longer has to read in the template ontology at the beginning and then write the output ontology to a file for permanent storage at the end Instead the program can simply establish a connection to the database when started and it then has access to all of the preexisting data including the template ontology 7 ANALYSIS Up to this point we have described in extensive detail the problem definition how the template ontology was created and how the data was extracted and combined with the template ontology to form the structured output We will now examine the methods we used to analyze the data For both domains the major obstacle to performing analysis of significant depth is the massive amount of data associated with the event In order for analysts to answer substantive questions they must be able to efficiently filter the data for the information pertinent to the question at hand To achieve this data filtering we used SPARQL.6 The benefit of SPARQL for our application is that it allows for the easy creation of what we referred to as N-th order queries that filter the data to preciously what we need in accordance with the ontology By N-th order queries we mean a SPARQL query that has multiple layers or orders of filtering that restrict the data This is best seen through an example For illustrative purpose we will again use the Boise St vs Oklahoma game Let's say an analyst was interested in finding out if Boise St had any big pass plays when they were deep in their own territory The occurrence of such plays would speak to Boise St.'s ability to use big plays to change the game as well as to provide some barometer for how conservative their play calling on offense was As such the analyst might develop a SPARQL query that has an equivalent English sentence of Give me all the completed passes thrown by Boise St where they were on their own 25 or less that went for 15 or more yards This particular query is a fifth-order query Explicitly the layers of filtering are 1 completed pass 2 Boise St 3 own side of the field 4 less than 25 yardline and 5 gained 15 or greater yards To answer the posed question such an occurrence occurred twice in the Boise St vs Oklahoma game The first was a 19 yard gain from Jared Zabransky to Legedu Naanee starting at the Boise St 17 at the beginning of the second quarter and the other was a 36 yard completion from Zabransky to Derek Schouman starting at the 22 yardline on the last drive of regulation The ability to perform such N-th order queries is absolutely critical to operations analysis in combat simulations A sample question an operations analyst might ask for in a scenario is Give me all the times a F-22 on a DCA mission was shot and killed at by a specific SAM type within a geographic region bounded by minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes This is a ninth-order query where the layers are 1 shot fired 2 kill resulted 3 target of F-22 4 attacker of a specific SAM type such as SA-10 5 F-22 mission of DCA 6 shot location greater than minimum latitude 7 shot location less than maximum latitude 8 shot location greater than minimum longitude and 9 shot location less than a maximum longitude Given unstructured nature of the output data from most 8 6htro ii uerV 8  1 11 I_ 


simulations answering such questions previously required extensive datamining that could take at least hours if not days to perform and was highly susceptible to error However a SPARQL query could return the results in tenths of seconds for small data sets and minutes for very large datasets Plus if the parse is well formed and properly debugged there is no chance for errors either returning a false positive or an omission Another tremendous benefit received from the structuring of the data and querying it with SPARQL is the increased ease of debugging the definition of the scenario This is not necessarily a problem in football but it is a significant issue in combat simulation The very large scenarios blessed by the government to represent certain encounters of interest have thousands of platforms each individually created with unique properties As such even a low error rate yields a non-trivial amount of mistakes some of which could profoundly affect results Many man-hours are sunk into validating the details of a scenario such as the networks of the IADS or the command chain of platforms all of which is tedious Several well placed SPARQL queries can help greatly reduce the scenario debugging time and make the debugging less cumbersome in the process One of the lone downsides to employing the abovedescribed methodology for data mining and analysis in the combat simulation domain is the lack of familiarity of most analysts with these techniques While the learning curve is shallow schedule and mindset challenges limit most seasoned analysts ability to learn about Java RDF ontologies and SPARQL To help facilitate the creation of N-th order queries we developed a GUI to wrap around the code in the combat simulation domain The GUI was developed using NetBeans Matisse GUI developer and made creating N-th order queries simply a manner of selecting the desired options on the GUI As a result the analysts did not need to be Java programmers with extensive RDF knowledge in order to use the program Instead they simply needed to have knowledge of the domain which is already a prerequisite for performing the analysis 8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The combat simulation domain is faced with the problem of having several different tools that represent data that is fundamentally the same in their own unique way The domain requires a method for combining disparate data into a common ontology as well as a way to then mine through the masses of data and filter out only that which is relevant to the current analysis In this paper we proposed a solution to this problem using RDF ontologies to commonly represent the domain and SPARQL queries to filter the results Due to the propriety classified nature of the work however we developed and presented a solution to a similar domain that being analyzing college football College football was chosen due to its similarities to the combat simulation domain which include 1 the output comes from a variety of sources represented in their own unique way but typically from ASCII text chronological log files 2 both domains contain ASCII lists of actors performing actions specific to the domain 3 both domains allow for a limited number of actions yet require tremendous ontological flexible within the actions and actors and 4 both domains require analysts to apply many-order filters to extract the desired in-depth information The bulk of the paper focused on the specifics of how the ontology was created how the ontology was combined with the data and finally the methods used in querying the data To these ends Stanford's Protege was used to create the ontology A Java program was then used to parse the data from input and output files after which the information was combined with the template ontology through the use of the Jena Semantic Web Framework or Jena The data were stored in an Oracle lOg database for permanent storage SPARQL was then used to query the data with a GUI assisting in this process The work yielded some significant conclusions SPARQL provided a simple methodology for creating the N-th order queries required by both domains Furthermore the execution of these queries provided access to data and answers to questions in seconds that required hours or days to get previously This drastic reduction in time and increase in the ease of use could literally transform the modem day combat simulation analyst from a glorified data miner back into an analyst Abstracting away the data mining and post-processing allows the analyst to focus on the forest instead of the type of bark on the trees in the forest Furthermore the unification of several sources into a common ontology allows for the analyst to be an expert in the entire domain not an expert in a specific tool Furthermore the encoding of the output into an ontology helps ensure the validity of the data and provides for additional scenario debugging assistance The validity of the data is augmented by the fact that the ontology eliminates all ambiguity in which entity is being used regardless of how it was referenced as well as any ambiguity in the definition of a certain event The assistance in debugging the scenario comes from the use of SPARQL queries on the input to the scenario such as verifying the members of a network in the IADS or the command chain of the platforms The SPARQL queries help provide quick access to the information and allow it to be displayed in a manner that is less cumbersome to crosscheck This allows for faster debugging of the input scenario

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process.
