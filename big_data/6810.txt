MACA A Privacy-Preserving Multi-factor Cloud Authentication System Utilizing Big Data Wenyi Liu A Selcuk Uluagac and Raheem Beyah GT CAP Group The School of ECE Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta GA 30332 USA  wliu76@gatech.edu  gatech.edu  selcuk rbeyah  ece.gatech.edu Abstract Multi-factor authentication MFA is an approach to user validation that requires the presentation of two or more authentication factors Given the popularity of cloud systems MFA systems become vital in authenticating users However MFA approaches are highly intrusive and expose users sensitive information to untrusted cloud servers that can keep physically identifying elements of users long after the user ends the relationship with the cloud To address these concerns in this work we present a privacy-preserving multi-factor authentication system utilizing the features of big data called MACA In MACA the rst factor is a password while the second factor is a hybrid proìle of user behavior The hybrid proìle is based on users integrated behavior which includes both host-based characteristics and network ow-based features MACA is the rst MFA that considers both user privacy and usability combining big data features 26 total conìgurable features Furthermore we adopt fuzzy hashing and fully homomorphic encryption FHE to protect users sensitive proìles and to handle the varying nature of the user proìles We evaluate the performance of our proposed approach through experiments with several public datasets Our results show that our proposed system can successfully validate legitimate users while detecting impostors Index Terms Authentication in Cloud Fuzzy Hashing Fully Homomorphic Encryption Privacy-Preserving Authentication I I NTRODUCTION There is great demand to establish a multi-factor authentication MFA system which requires two or more authentication factors i.e knowledge possession identity to validate users during their login into a cloud service Several popular services employ MFA usually as an optional feature which is deactivated by default such as Amazon Google 2 Microsoft Each of these techniques requires an out-ofband channel e.g an App text message and an extra step for a user which reduces usability Similarly there have been quite a few academic proposals for MFA systems  In a typical MFA system each user is veriìed via the rst authentication factor usually password along with a second or even a third factor such as smartcards ngerprints  or user s mouse mo v ements 8 MF A solutions based on physical devices or physiological characteristics depend on the introduction of specialized hardware such as a token or a ngerprint reader which hinders usability and deployability by causing additional cost for manufacturing and implementation Alternatively the more usable and therefore more likely to be widely-adopted MFA solutions are based on users behavior however they do little to protect their privacy This is critical given that the validity of the speciìc user characteristics shared with a cloud service will likely signiìcantly outlast the period of time for which the services are needed  To address these challenges in this paper we propose a privacy-preserving multi-factor authentication system called MACA which collects hybrid user behavior proìles to serve as a second authentication factor along with the user password as the rst MACA is the rst MFA that considers both user privacy and usability Instead of just focusing on one speciìc category of user behavior like system processes or userês mouse movements we integrate features from several categories to generate a userês proìle We also adopt fuzzy hashing and fully homomorphic encryption FHE 13 techniques to ensure that a userês personal information is not leaked to cloud or a third party and that the system is able to tolerate variations in a userês plaintext and corresponding cryptographic proìles Further MACA incorporates big data features efìciently in the authentication process Speciìcally MACA uses a large combination of host-based characteristics and network-based features to proìle users Combining multiple features total 26 conìgurable features and the large amount of data associated with each feature enable a much simpler threshold-based user classiìcation instead of expensive machine learning on the cloud Since the operations for user classiìcation are simple the numerical portion of the proìle can be veriìed using FHE For example using FHE a cloud operator can ascertain whether a userês average throughput value is in an acceptable range without knowing the actual value Finally for the string portion of the user proìle fuzzy hashing is used to match similar strings without knowing the actual values of the strings We performed experiments using a user proìle database derived from several public datasets  and a dataset we generated Based on those data we evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of recall false positive rate size of information required for authentication system overhead  and resource utilization  Our results show that the proposed scheme shows signiìcant promise for detecting impostors from legitimate users The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows 2014 IEEE INFOCOM Workshops: 2014 IEEE INFOCOM Workshop on Security and

2 We review the related work in Section II Assumptions and the adversary model are presented in Section III We explain the details of MACA in Section IV We present our experimental design and discuss the results in Section V We conclude this paper in Section VI II R ELATED W ORK Authentication via more than one factor Multi-Factor Authentication MFA has become an increasingly essential component for cloud systems a vital means to ensure that users no matter where they are are in fact who they claim to be and thus are authorized to gain access to cloud resources A number of researchers have proposed the design and implementation of MFA systems  with each presenting its own speciìc advantages and tradeoffs Knowledge factor i.e passwords is the most ubiquitous authentication factor It is widely-known that the sole use of passwords has many weaknesses Nevertheless passwords are still in use and are the de facto standard MF A systems using passwords along with a possession factor are commonly found in electronic commerce and online banking Security tokens also called One-Time-Password OTP tokens is one of the most commonly-used possession factor  which generates a pseudo-random number at pre-determined intervals e.g RSA SecurID and V eriSign Security T o k e n 5 Additionally  these cards serve as an extra authentication factor especially in corporate network environments For instance in K umar proposed a secure remote user authentication scheme with smart cards for corporate networks Unfortunately an MFA system with a possession factor usually depends on the distribution of some speciìc device which is cumbersome and not user-friendly Besides the introduction of physical devices may pose further security risks if the devices are lost stolen or replicated without the knowledge of the legitimate user Finally authentication via an identity factor is also a wellstudied area of research Identity factors are further categorized as either physiological biometrics or behavioral characteristics 19 Physiological biometrics such as ngerprints iris and face have already drawn considerable attention in academia and have been implemented widely in industry Behavioral biometrics such as mouse movements keystroke dynamics graphical passwords have also gained popularity in the research community Similar to MF A systems with possession factors  MFA systems with physiological biometrics suffer from a relatively low usability and deployability due to the implementation cost of biometrics recognition devices To the best of our knowledge no consideration has been given to the privacy issue when authenticating based on user behavior for cloud systems utilizing big data This is critical given that the validity of the speciìc user characteristics shared with a cloud operator will likely signiìcantly outlast the period of time for which the cloud services are needed Therefore our goal in this work is to develop a privacy-preserving multifactor authentication system based on passwords along with hybrid user proìles that considers both usability and privacy issues As we consider a large amount of host-based characteristics and network-based features and the corresponding data the large amount of data associated with each feature enable a much simpler threshold-based user classiìcation instead of expensive machine learning in the cloud III A SSUMPTIONS AND A DVERSARY M ODEL In our system we make the following two assumptions 1 Perfect knowledge assumption   We assume that the adversary has perfect knowledge of the multi-factor authentication system including the strategy of user proìle acquisition the mechanism of proìle encryption/hashing and the details of the authentication protocol 2 First-Factor knowledge assumption  We assume that the adversary knows the victimês rst authentication factor which is the user password In our adversary model a malicious entity can attack the proposed multi-factor authentication system via impersonating a legitimate user victim in order to gain access to the victimês account We speciìcally consider the following two types of adversaries brute-force attacker and honest-but-curious server attacker  1 Brute-force attacker  A computationally bounded thirdparty adversary may attempt to authenticate with a spoofed second authentication factor by exhaustively searching for the correct user proìle Such an attack consists of enumerating all possible user proìles until the correct one is found which in the worst case would involve traversing the entire message space 2 Honest-but-curious server attacker  In our system we assume the server in the cloud that processes the authentication requests is honest-but-curious that a stores incoming cryptographic data without tampering with it b honestly processes each authentication request and returns the corresponding outcome c but tries to derive the underlying sensitive information from the userês cryptographic proìle Moreover we use a fuzzy hashing scheme implemented as sdhash  by Rousseu 21 to match data with similarities In industry fuzzy hashing has been applied in the realm of security forensics especially in identifying morphing malware and spam In our system we adopt fuzzy hashing to evaluate the similarity of two fuzzy hash values of user behavior features in the forms of strings without revealing the userês sensitive information to the authentication server Finally we achieve the privacy of a userês proìle with fully homomorphic encryption FHE 22 23 Speciìcally we used and improved the open-source library Simple-Homomorphic-Encryption  in our authentication system which is a C implementation of homomorphic encryption discussed in The user sends the information

from 51 subjects typists each typing a password 400 times 25 3 DACS Dataset  is a dataset consisting of the netw ork trace for an educational organization We used SplitPcap to obtain 30-min-long separate pcap les and for each small pcap le we ran TSTAT to deri v e the o w-based features thus generating the userês network behavior proìle This data set spans two months In addition to these three datasets we generated the dataset that contains le system and registry information with 130 different software names 30 O/S preinstalled 100 personalized for 15 subjects Then based on these four datasets we generated 300 different 30-min-long hybrid user proìle samples Moreover for each user we registered his/her rst piece of cryptographic hybrid user proìle in the database the enrollment of that user Then we appended a label to each proìle indicating the owner of that proìle We randomly chose half of all the hybrid user proìle samples and intentionally labeled them incorrectly making the actual owner of that proìle appear as an intruder For the other half of the hybrid user proìle samples we correctly labeled them treating the owner as a legitimate user Finally we randomly split all the labeled user proìles into two equal sized parts the training set and the testing set We hashed and encrypted each proìle in the testing set via Fuzzy Hashing and FHE as explained in Sections III IV We conducted all the experiments on a standard laptop computer with Intel CPU i5-M430 2.27GHz and RAM of 4 GB B Results and Discussion We evaluated our system in terms of recall false positive rate system overhead size of authentication packet and resource utilization 1 Recall   Recall is the proportion of positive cases that are correctly identiìed and was calculated using TP TP  FN TP denotes True Positive and FN denotes False Negative while in our authentication system an intruder is labeled as Positive and a legitimate user as Negative 2 False Positive Rate FPR  FPR is the proportion of negatives cases that are incorrectly classiìed as positive and was calculated using TN FP  TN TN denotes True Negative while FP denotes False Positive 3 Size of Authentication Packets hereafter referred to as packet size  Packet size is the size of all the authentication information transmitted from client to the server 4 System Overhead  System Overhead is the initial latency during the entire multifactor authentication process We evaluated the overhead introduced by user proìle acquisition cryptography data transmission and server processing 5 Resource Utilization  Resource Utilization is deìned as how much system resources it takes for user information acquisition program to continuously retrieve information and derive features in terms of CPU and RAM utilization We conducted a series of experiments on the testing set containing 150 labeled hybrid user proìle samples within different time window sizes for data collection To decide whether a hybrid user proìle is legitimate we rst determined appropriate thresholds for individual characteristics that comprise the proìles Next we used a majority vote to make the nal decision on the legitimacy of a proìle sample A training set containing 150 labeled hybrid user proìle samples served as a priori knowledge The experimental results in terms of recall and false positive rate FPR are presented in Table III TABLE

window for the data collection the better the system performance is in terms of recall and FPR When the time window is as long as 30 minutes initial bootstrap latency this drops to 0 for every attempt after 30 minutes we achieve an optimal result with recall of 80.8 and FPR of 14.7 Nevertheless a longer data collection time tends to reduce the usability of the system Therefore there is a trade off between system accuracy and efìciency Next we evaluated the other three system performance indicators packet size system overhead and resource utilization In terms of packet size for the rst-time user enrollment the packet size is the sum of the size of the userês public key pk  uid  Password Psw  and cryptographic user proìle  P  Since the size of uid and Psw are far less than the size of the rest we can neglect uid and Psw in the calculations Packet size Size  was calculated using Equation 5 in which pkSize denotes the size of public key pk  n denotes the number of string features  denotes the size of each fuzzy hash m denotes the number of number features and  denotes the size of each FHE ciphertext In MACA with pkSize 0  98 MB,n 9   0  125 KB,m 24  and   146 KB  the packet size for the enrollment is approximately 4507 KB In the authentication procedure the user is not expected to transmit their pk again so the packet size is around 3504 KB after enrollment Size  pkSize  n    m   5

6 data transmission T t and the server process T s  We can derive T using Equation 6 T t largely depends on the network environment In a high-speed Internet environment T t is normally under 30 seconds T s was less than 5 seconds in our experiments In total the system latency after users initiate a login request is around 35 seconds Note that system overhead may vary because it depends on the computing ability of both the client and the cloud and also to the speciìc network conditions T af ter  T t  T s 6 In terms of resource utilization in our experiments the running of the user proìle acquisition program takes less than 3 of CPU resources and about 15MB of RAM The biggest proportion of computing resource consumption stems from the capturing of network packets Because we only capture packet headers the resource demanded for network monitoring is still in an acceptable range As the statistics for resource utilization is based on a laptop computer with Intel CPU i5M430 2.27GHz and a RAM of 4 GB the CPU utilization percentage will decrease with a more powerful computer The evaluation of recall FPR packet size system overhead and resource utilization demonstrates the feasibility of MACA Note that as both packet size and overhead are largely dependent on the time and space complexity of FHE with further improvements in FHE one can reduce both packet size and system overhead thereby further boosting performance VI C ONCLUSION In this work we developed a privacy-preserving multifactor authentication system without introduction of any extra physical device for cloud systems utilizing big data features In our system called MACA the rst factor is a password and the second factor is a hybrid user proìle that summarizes user behavior MACA focuses on the privacy preservation of the second factor which has two advantages over previously proposed systems First user privacy is not leaked to ubiquitous cloud computing environment with FHE and fuzzy hashing Second the hybrid user proìling model is highly usable and conìgurable and integrates a lot of features and corresponding data which enables simple privacy-preserving MFA operations with FHE and fuzzy-hashing calculations One can always modify the feature list total 26 conìgurable features for user proìling in MACA according to the actual circumstances We evaluated the system performance via a series of experiments utilizing four different datasets resulting in an optimal recall of 80.8%and FPR of 14.7 Also both system overhead and resource utilization are within the acceptable range which substantiates the feasibility of our scheme We plan to extend our work by adding more features and including a weighting scheme on features that can be conìgured by the system administrator and

  7 5  T RACKER SEQUENCE  The Tracker Sequence is the output file of the SRS/Timeliner-TLX TM file parser. This file will be compiled which generates an executable and a listing file The executable is then installed into the Timeliner-TLX TM Executor / Engine. Upon installation, the operator must start the Tracker Sequence. As soon as the Tracker Sequence becomes active, this sequence will run every second scanning for active bundles. The first check in the sequence will determine if a given bundle is active. The logic will then decide if the specified sequence in the current bundle is active. If the sequence is active, it will then check if the sequence statement is within a range of line numbers. If the active sequence lies between the sequence statement range a message will then be logged to the Timeliner-TLX TM  engine log file indicating a requirement has been encountered. Figure 10 depicts the Tracker Sequence code Figure 10 \226 Tracker Sequence Code Example  6  R EAL TIME EXECUTION  The Tracker Sequence must be started first in the execution order as installing the HAL_Main Bundle will begin autonomous operations for the AFTS Test-Bed. The Tracker Sequence monitors for the bundle installation of HAL_Main. When the bundle is installed, sequences within the bundle become \223active\224 automatically. Once the HAL_Main bundle installation is detected, the Tracker Sequence monitors for the individual sequences to become active. Once the sequences become active, Timeliner-TLX TM begins reporting execution line numbers. The Tracker Sequence monitors the reported line numbers for requirement ranges, matching a line number to the requirement line number ranges. When a match is found, a message statement is issued to the Timeliner-TLX TM  console. A log message is written to the log file. This same interaction is performed for each bundle and sequence that is installed and becomes \223active\224, as many times as the sequence is executed. After the test-plan is executed, the log is utilized for analysis of requirement coverage. For the AFTS Test-Bed, the log depicts the time of execution and the order of the test-plan as executed in real-time. If multiple test plans are to be executed, such as an autonomous plan of fluid transfers, the Tracker sequence can simply stay active as it continually scans for bundle installations and active sequences until manually stopped by the operator. There are occasions where a requirement is satisfied by only a few lines of code producing a line number range that is small. The AFTS Test-Bed had one requirement \(validate transfer quantity\ which  encompassed only one or two lines of code. During testing the team noticed the validation requirement was not being reported, although the validation code was executed. This meant that the Timeliner-TLX TM execution engine was executing these lines of code rapidly enough that the reported execution line was past the requirement bounded code. The TLX engine executes at a 1 Hz rate within the CPU, and the number of statements that the engine can execute is dependent upon the number of sequences that are currently active. The more sequences that are active, the less number of statements within each sequence are executed The solution to force reporting of bounded statements is to place a \223Wait 1\224 statement within the requirement range The WAIT statement provides a one second wait in execution and will force the sequence to give up its execution time slice within the TLX engine, and the current line number will be reported  7  L OG OUTPUT AND ANALYSIS  Figure 11 shows the log output produced by the Tracker Sequence. The time frame of this log file shows the initialization of the AFTS through three autonomous fluid transfers; one via the back-up leg with one of a quarter tank quantity, a second transfer where the crew selects the quantity transferred over the backup leg, and the third transfer which is a crew selectable quantity transferred over the primary leg. During initialization of the AFTS, the software system queries the crew on the status of manual valves which does not provide telemetry. If the manual valves are not in an operational state, or the query is not Sequence TRACKER Active We start our control loop to monitor every second  Every 1.0 then If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.BUNSTAT = BUN_ACTIVE Then -- Is the bundle active If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.Initialize.SEQSTAT = SEQ_ACTIVE Then -- Is the Initialize Sequence active If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.Initialize.SEQSTMT IN 25..38 then -- Current line within the req range Message "GAFTS-0001 Manual Valve Status Query Requirement End If If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.Initialize.SEQSTMT IN 39..54 then -- Current line within the req range Message "GAFTS-0006 Autonomous Procedure Installation Requirement End If End If End If 


  8 answered within one minute, the system inhibits the autonomous installation of auto-procedures preventing operation of the test bed in a non-operational state. The log traces the date and time, the requirement encountered and executed, the Timeliner-TLX TM Bundle Name that contained the requirement, the tracking tag of the bundle which is created at compilation time and utilized for configuration management of the software system, and the requirement ID including the text that was encountered during execution. The Tracking Tag is another unique feature of the Timeliner-TLX TM system as this internal identifier is also reported in telemetry during execution allowing operations to uniquely identify the procedures in execution. The Tracking Tag can be decoded as it is a date/time stamp, produced in binary coded decimal, after a successful compilation of the procedure. The log output shows that after the crew manual valve query, autonomous installation of the AFTS software occurred and that three fluid transfers of different types were directed by the crew The log is then used to determine which requirements were met during the current test plan. In this way, test plans can be tailored to include operations that were missed. Software Quality personnel can now scan the log for requirement and test plan analysis for anomalies encountered during testing Figure \226 11 Timeline-TLX Log Output Example  8  S UMMARY  The Command and control procedures developed utilizing the Timeliner-TLX TM within AFTS test-bed have been instrumental in proving the concept of automated and autonomous operations for a deep space mission. The testing has helped to pave the path for extended research and validating the transition from auto-procedure to flight software. The idea of moving command and control from ground control centers to th e crew on a manned deep space mission involves extended research of how to develop intelligent auto-procedures and how much of the operational environment will change. The early analysis of Autoprocedures has shown that there are 4 types of procedures Extensive testing and research will be needed to solidify this confidence and exactly detail the development requirements for auto-procedures to be an accepted norm for operations Further hardware software integration testing will lead to a more detailed concept of what an autonomous architecture will entail and how to qualify the software for flight. The Timeliner-TLX TM system\222s unique line reporting feature provides a process to verify and validate what requirements are met in real time to aid hardware and software designers in this endeavor. It is envisioned that on-board intelligent auto-procedures will be required on manned deep space missions due to the extreme communications delays, and auto-procedure updates will still be occurring with Earth based assets. A rapid verification and validation of autoprocedures will be needed for such \223on mission\224 vehicle updates   R EFERENCES  1  Stetson, H.K.; Haddock, A.T.; \223Automated Operations Development for Advanced Exploration Systems,\224 American Institute of Aerona utics and Astronautics, Space Ops 2012, Stockholm Sweden  TIME TAG            BUNDLE NAME                     TRACKING TAG      MESSAGE TEXT  07/16/13 09:22:18 REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151   GAFTS-0001 Manual Valve Requirement 07/16/13 09:22:24  REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151     GAFTS-0006 Autonomous Procedure Requirement 07/16/13 09:22:26  REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151     GAFTS-0006 Autonomous Procedure Requirement 07/16/13 09:22:27  REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151     GAFTS-0006 Autonomous Procedure requirement 07/16/13 09:27:58  REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151    AAFTS-0002 Quarter Tank Transfer Requirement 07/16/13 09:38:10 REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151  AAFTS-0008 Crew Transfer Requirement 07/16/13 09:39:37 REQUIREMENT_TRACER2  1307160850040151  AAFTS-0007 Crew Return Requirement

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
