Conserved Domain Combination Identiﬁcation in Human Proteins Suk Hoon Jung Desok Kim Dong-Soo Han 001 School of Engineering Information and Communications University Yusong Daejeon Korea  jsh kimdesok dshan  icu.ac.kr Abstract In this paper we propose a method for the analysis of conservation of domain combinations in proteins Using the method we extract conserved domain combinations in Homo sapience proteome and examine their GO term annotations in order to understand the co-evolution of domains in a proteome Unlike conventional methods which use cooccurrence frequency for evolutionary analysis of domains the proposed method measures mutual dependency of domains in proteins as well According to the results domains in Homo sapience proteome turn out to form patterns whose members are highly afﬁliated to one another Besides GO term analysis shows that extracted patterns have a tendency of being associated with molecular functions and molecular functions are more related with mutual dependency than co-occurrence frequency of domains Those results indicate that the proposed method adopting mutual dependency outperforms conventional methods in terms of nding domain combinations conserved through evolution for molecular functional collaboration 1 Introduction Domain is a conserved unit of compact threedimensional structure and evolution 13  wh ich car r i es sp eciﬁc function 14 A s cons erv e d f unct i onal uni t s  domai ns offer an abstract level at which the protein may be studied 10 s o t h e d et ect i o n o f domai ns i s one of t h e  rs t s t e ps toward assigning functions to a protein Therefore domainbased protein function annotation resources are getting popular these days 6  a nd accumulated domain r es ources are widely utilized in laboratory a nd computational methods for protein function discovery 11 Although a domain has its own function the function of a domain should be considered in association with neigh\001 Corresponding author School of Engi neering Information and Communications University P.O.Box 77 Yusong Daejeon 305-600 Korea telephone 82-042-866-6290 e-mail dshan@icu.ac.kr bor domains due to environmental sensitivity of polypeptide chain Actually neighbor domains are one of the most inﬂuential circumstances for the domain folding and function and its experimental evidences were reported in several genes Domains in a protein might have relationship called domain interplay 17 or intra-domain communication 3 A domain might indirectly inﬂuences on neighbor domains in a protein 3  1 7   e x p licitly tak e s a r o le in en h a n c in g  repressing or stabilizing the functions of neighbors 4  o r strengthen target function with neighbors playing the same functional role 9  W i t h t h i s concept i on s e v e ral r es earch groups started to use the notion of domain combination in protein function prediction methods considering neighbor effect 12 15   s o t hat t he y obt ai ned r el at i v el y good res u l t s  Therefore considering a protein just as a set of domains and studying each domain independen tly might bring improper results in the study of protein function When we consider that proteins have evolved toward speciﬁc functions a domain may appear in association with other domains which have signiﬁcant effects on the aimed functions If so those co-appearing domains in a protein a domain combination must be conserved through protein evolution for functional inter play Several researches clue us on conserved domain combination phenomena in various way co-occurrence and domain assembling versatility and give some evidences supporting the notion of conserved domain combination 2 19   H o w e v er none of t hos e e l u ci dates the phenomena of conserved domain combination as they mainly explain only the master and servant relationship between two domains  They limit the number of domains in combinations and domain assembling versatility or association is measured based on an interesting domain but not on all of members in a combination Besides biological analysis is not sufﬁcient due to the manual inspection For the study of the conservation of domain combination a systematic method needs to be devised to measure the conservation degree of each domain combination Usually protein sequence conservation has been evaluated by sequence alignment Domain combination conservation should be evaluated in the similar manner as well yet also the rela

tionships of domains in a combination should be considered In this paper we fortify the notion of domain combination by identifying conserved domain combinations and analyzing functional relations among domains in a combination First we develop a quantitative method for the analysis of conservation of domain combination as applying two concepts of association rule learning technique that is widely used in data mining and treatment leaning The method measures mutual dependency between domains and co-occurrence frequency in a proteome Unlike other previous researches it systematically evaluates the signiﬁcance of each domain combination in terms of conservation irrespective of the number of members versatility and their continuity The term of support denotes domain’s co-occurrence frequency and all-conﬁdence denotes the mutual dependency in a combination respectively support and all-conﬁdence are the terms used in association rules in general The term of domain pattern is coined to denote a domain combination that is regarded to be highly conserved through evolution A domain pattern miner algorithm extracts domain patterns using predeﬁned minimum support and allconﬁdence threshold From the experiments we used record from UniProt Knowledgebase 7 releas e 9 3 a nd reﬁned them agains t InterPro 6 domai n i nformat i o n rel eas e 13.1 Domain pattern miner has extracted 681 domain patterns from 39,563 Homo sapience human proteins Four fth of human proteins have one or more domain patterns In order to elucidate biological roles or members cooperations of conserved domain combinations we have analyzed domain patterns based on Gene Ontology GO terms annotated to each domain 5  T he GO term analys is reveals that domains in a pattern have a tendency of having functional similarity which obeys our assumption about domains cooperation in conserved domain combination Also it is revealed that all-conﬁdence have higher correlation with functional similarity than support does support is conventionally used for conserved domain combination identiﬁcation These facts indicate that the strategy adopting mutual dependency outperforms methods using only cooccurrence frequency in identifying domain combinations contributing to the same function Besides The comparison among the results of analysis on three GO term categories shows that the domain patterns are correlative with molecular function but not with biological process or cellular component Therefore we conclude that the conserved domain combination is the team for molecular functional collaboration and the collaboration is one of the reasons why the combination have been assembled through the evolution 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Conserved Domain Combination Criteria From proteins in an organism we can extract huge amount of domain combination which may or may not have biological meaning Domain combinations appearing in several proteins within a genome are likely to have evolved by gene duplication so those are the result of evolutionary conservation of domains for some biological and functional advantage Therefore like the deﬁnition of conservation sequences frequently found identical domain combination in an organism should be regarded as conserved and signiﬁcant assembly In nature several domains are abundant like as Kinase 18  P rot e i n s  w h at ab undant domai n b el ongs t o  would generate a frequent domain combination having abundant domain Therefore this frequent combination caused by member’s abundance is not necessarily meaningful and association analysis can overcome this problem Conserved domain combination may comprise domains that carry some biological mean ing by members interplay thus the association characteristics of domains should be understood A domain has chemical and physical feature so its roles in domain interplay are limited and the domain would appear only in combinations in what it can take a role for target functions Therefore the members of conserved combination should have dependencies on each other members Also the dependency should be mutual since abundant domains compel dependency from minor domains If every domain is mutually dependent on one another in the same combination then we can say the combination is signiﬁcant and conserved 2.2 Domain Pattern Mining Conserved domain combination is easily identiﬁed as domain pattern with data mining technique that fulﬁlls two criteria frequency and mutual dependency We utilized two concepts in association rule running technique support and all-conﬁdence  Association rule running is widely used in the eld of data mining and can represent signiﬁcance and the strength of the itemset within the entire data The notion support denotes the number of transactions that support an itemset 1 Support for an itemset is deﬁned as in given transaction set the fraction of transactions that contains all items of given itemset In the case of this research the item is domain the itemset is given domain combination and the transaction is protein As support counts the fraction of itemset it is surely applicable to evaluate how frequently a domain combination occurs or domains occur together Support corresponds to statistical signiﬁcance so

motivation for support constraint comes from the fact that we are interested only in frequent appearing domain combination above predeﬁned minimum support Ifthe support of a domain combination is not large enough the combination is not thought to be conserved and not worth consideration Deﬁnition 1 Support of dc a domain combination is supp  dc   p  p 001 P 002 dc 003 p   P  where p is a protein in proteome P Conﬁdence measures the strength of association within itemset 1 In t h e c ont e x t o f p rot e i n s a nd domai ns  a n a s s o ciation rule is of the form X 004 Y  which means the presence of domain set X implies the presence of domain set Y in the same protein The conﬁdence of the association rule X 004 Y is written as conf X 004 Y as deﬁned by Deﬁnition 2 Deﬁnition 2 Conﬁdence of X 004 Yis conf  X 004 Y   p  p 001 P 002 X 005 Y 003 p   p  p 001 P 002 X 003 p  All-conﬁdence is a measure of the interestingness of an association whose result v alue can be regarded as a degree of mutual dependency within an itemset 16  Allconﬁdence value is the minimum of the conﬁdence values of all rules that can be produced from target itemset Also with the predeﬁned minimum threshold an association is deemed interesting if it has an All-conﬁdence greater than threshold This indicates that there is a dependency among all of the items in the association Since basic conﬁdence is measured with prior antecedent condition and item orientation it could not applicable for domain combination when we are not interested in certain domain in a combination In contrast to the conﬁdence  allconﬁdence is useful measure of mutual dependency within an itemset regardless of orientation of items Therefore it can surely be applied to measuring the strength of the domain combination Deﬁnition 3 The all-conﬁdence of a domain combination dc is all  conf  dc   p  p 001 P 002 dc 003 p  MAX  i 004 l  l 001 PowerSet  dc  002 l 005  001 002 l 005  dc 002 i   p  p 001 P 002 l 003 p    Domains in a conserved domain combination should be associated with and dependent on one another also they should be co-occurred frequently Therefore domain pattern mining with predeﬁned minimum support and allconﬁdence thresholds must be promising for conserved domain combination identiﬁcation Even though a domain combination has values that exceed predeﬁned constraints of support and all-conﬁdence  it could be useless as a domain pattern Some domain combination has superset with the same support  and that means the subset occurs only when the superset does In that case subset has no meaning or we can not measure the meaning of subset with given protein data Therefore those domain combinations should be trimmed before observing support and all-conﬁdence  These characteristic is deﬁned as maximal property and used to deﬁne domain pattern Deﬁnition 4 A domain combination X has maximal property if no superset of this combination has the same or greater support Deﬁnition 5 A domain combination X is a domain pattern if it has maximal property and supp\(X s c all-conf\(X  a c where s c and a c are predeﬁned minimum thresholds According to predeﬁned minimum support and allconﬁdence thresholds of course various domain pattern sets could be deﬁned Therefore minimum support and allconﬁdence threshold should be deﬁned after examining the characteristic of target organism or protein set 2.3 Functional Analysis of Domain Combination We introduce our strategy to measure functional similarity among given domain combination exploiting GO term information annotated to each member domain In this research we use a term Internal Function Similarity IFS  denoting whether members of a domain combination are devoting the similar function or not GO is the ontology for the feature of the gene products GO is a set of structured vocabularies organized in a rooted directed acyclic graph DAG describing attributes of proteins domains or RNA in three categories of cellular component  biological process and molecular function  Each of GO categories should be analyzed respectively as they have different biological meaning The functional similarity of two GO terms must be considered with hierarchical manner as GO is ontology Therefore we adopted FuSSiMeG function  t o i n v e s t i g at e s i m ilarity of two GO terms FuSSiMeG which is a tool computing the semantic similarity between two GO terms exploits Jiang and Conrath’s semantic similarity measure that provides the best result overall 8 Since FuSSiMeG generates similarity value for two GO terms it should be extended into IFS for observing functional relationship of multip le GO terms annotated domain

with their original undiscretized gene expression values SVM was run with its default radial kernel We ran randomForest 10 times with its default 500 trees for ALL LC and OC and its accuracy was constant For PC we had to increase randomForest's number of trees to 1000 before its accuracy stabilized over the 10 runs Table III contains the number of class 0/1 samples in the clinically determined training set the number of genes selected by our entropy discretization and our experimental results As shown in this table the overall average accuracies of BSTC and RCBT are again best at about 96 each When compared against RCBT SVM and randomForest on the individual tests we can see that BSTC is alone in having 100 accuracy on the majority of datasets However BSTC's performance on the preliminary AML/ALL dataset test is relatively poor This is likely due to over fitting Every error BSTC made mistook a class 0 AML test sample for a class 1 ALL test sample i.e all errors were made in this same direction And the ALL training data has both i about 2.5 times as many class 1 samples as class 0 samples and ii a small number of total samples/genes When the training set is more balanced and the number of samples/genes is larger we can expect that cancellation of errors will tend to neutralize/balance any over fitting effects in BSTC And BSTC is a method meant primarily for large training sets where CAR-mining is prohibitively expensive As we will see below in Section V-B.1 BSTC s performance is much better for larger AML/ALL training set sizes B Holdout Validation Studies Holdout validation studies make comparisons less susceptible to the choice of a single training dataset and provide performance evaluations that are likely to better represent program behavior in practice We next present results from a thorough holdout validation study completed using 100 different training/test sets from each of the ALL LC PC and OC data sets For these holdout validation tests we benchmark BSTC against Top-k/RCBT because i BSTC/RCBT perform hest in our preliminary experiments ii Top-k/RCBT is the fastest/most accurate CAR-based classifier for microarray data and iii we are interested in BSTC's CAR-related vs Topk/RCBT s CAR based scalability For the holdout validation study we generated training sets of sizes 40 60 and 80 of the total samples Each training set was produced by randomly selecting samples from the original combined dataset We then used the standard R dprep package's entropy minimized partition 17 to discretize the selected training samples Finally the remaining dataset samples were used for testing the two classifiers after rule/BST generation on the randomly selected training data For each training set size we produced 25 independent tests In addition to these training sets we created an additional 25 1-x/0-y tests To create these tests we chose training data by randomly selecting x class 1 samples and y class 0 samples to be used as training data As before the remaining samples were then used to test both classifiers For each dataset the x and y values are chosen so that the resulting 25 classification tests have the exact same training/test data proportions as the single related dataset test reported in section V-A For each training set size we plot our results using a boxplot Boxplot Interpretation Each boxplot that we show in this section can be interpreted as follows The median of the measurements is shown as a diamond and a box with boundaries is drawn at the first and the third quartile The range between these two quartiles is called the inter-quartile range IQR Vertical lines a.k.a whiskers are drawn from the box to indicate the minimum and the maximum value unless outliers are present If outliers are presents the whiskers only extend to 1 5 x IRQ The outliers that are near i.e within 3 x IRQ are drawn as an empty circle and further outliers are drawn using an asterisk 1 ALIJAML ALL Experiment Figure 4 shows the classification accuracy for the ALL/AML dataset As can be seen in this figure BSTC and RCBT have similar accuracy across the ALL/AML tests as a whole BSTC outperforms RCBT in terms of median and mean accuracy on the 40 and 80 training set sizes while RCBT has better median/mean accuracy on the 1-27/0-11 training size tests And both classifiers have the same median on the 60 training set size Over the 100 ALL/AML tests we see that BSTC has a mean accuracy of 92.13 while RCBT has a mean accuracy of 91.39 they are very close It's noteworthy that BSTC is 100 accurate on the majority of 80 training size tests However BSTC appears to have slightly higher variance than RCBT on all but the 40 training tests Considering all the results together both BSTC and RCBT have essentially equivalent classification accuracies on the ALL/AML dataset 2 Lung Cancer LC Experiment The results for the Lung Cancer dataset are reported in Figure 5 Here again both BSTC and RCBT have similar classification behavior RCBT has higher mean and median accuracies on the 40 and 60 tests while BSTC outperforms RCBT on the 1-16/0-16 tests Meanwhile both classifier have the same median on the 80 training test Over all 100 LC tests we find that BSTC has a mean accuracy of 96 32 while RCBT has a mean accuracy of 97.08 again they are very close As before BSTC is alone in having 100

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
