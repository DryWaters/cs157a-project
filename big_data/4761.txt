Abstract Association mining aims to 223nd valid correlations among data attributes and has been widely applied to many areas of data analysis In this paper we present a semantic network based association analysis model including three spreading activation methods and apply this model to assess the quality of a dataset and generate semantically valid new hypotheses for further investigation We evaluate our approach on a real public health dataset the Heartfelt study and the experiment shows promising results Keywords Association rule mining Semantic network Hypothesis generation Data quality assessment Association rule mining has b een widely applied to numerous domains such as analysis of marketbasket datasets text mining and disease diagnosis Association rules whose support and con\223dence are above user-speci\223ed thresholds are considered statistically signi\223cant and presented to end-users While these objective measures are e\002ective to reduce rule redundancy incorporation of subjective and domainspeci\223c knowledge is still a critical challenge for association analysis and these knowledge should be represented in a more structured way to maximize its usage Hence we choose semantic network to represent knowledge for association analysis Semantic network has been implemented in many knowledge bases Concepts and ideas in the human brain have been shown to be semantically linked which motivates the modern research of semantic network  A seman tic net w o rk represen ts kno wledge a s a directed graph where vertices represent concepts and edges represent semantic relations between the concepts Figure 1 shows a sample semantic network whose vertices represent concepts and edges are labeled with names of relations Concepts are organized into a hierarchical structure by Ping Chen Dept of Computer and Math Sciences University of Houston-Downtown 1 Main St Houston TX USA 77002 chenp@uhd.edu Walter Garcia Dept of Computer and Math Sciences University of Houston-Downtown 1 Main St Houston TX USA 77002 garciaw@uhd.edu Hypothesis Generation and Data Quality Assessment through Association Mining edges and other edges show causal relations e.g observable entity diagnose disease or syndrome stressed is a mental process diseases can be result of mental process Comparing with other knowledge representation models a semantic network has the following advantages 1 Easy to use A user needs little training or computer background to build semantic networks Semantic networks are easy to understand and its explanation is usually straightforward 2 Flexible incremental and easy to update Building a semantic network does not require a user to have a complete or perfect understanding at the beginning Instead the building processing can be incremental and knowledge can 1 BC\r is-a Proc. 9th  IEEE  Int.

vis-au An association edge in  2 Association Modeling with a Semantic Network BB\004 is a set of vertices that denote the attributes in the dataset and relevant concepts from its domain  These pairs are provided by users as not interesting or trivial instances For example in public health domain 215Obesity  No\216 is usually not interesting but 215Hypertension  Yes\216 is interesting Creation of such a semantic network can be highly automated if there exist electronic domain knowledge 2   An association edge denotes an association among attributes with as the antecedent part of an association also called the body and is a set of can be label with association edge means that this association is already known by the user A edge can be obtained from a user or other knowledge sources association edges represent highly con\223dent principles about a domain e.g 215observable entity indicates clinical 223nding\216 textitBASIC edges are used to identify semantically invalid hypothesis generated in Section 4 be updated locally as a user gets more familiar with a domain 3 Generative A semantic network is not a mere static structure instead it has a vertex-\223ring mechanism called spreading activation Firing or activation of a vertex sends activation to its semantically connected neighbor vertices Spreading activation only accesses local neighbor vertices so its time complexity does not grow with the size of the network In this paper we will discuss a semantic networkbased association analysis model With this model we will provide the following analysis techniques 1 Hypothesis generation New hypotheses are generated through generalization and inference from the association rule set and give end-users directions for further investigation 2 Data quality assessment A dataset is just an imperfect and incomplete re\224ection of a realworld object or scenario By analyzing association rules we can assess the quality of original dataset This paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we discuss a knowledge model to represent domain and user knowledge We present three spreading activation methods in 3 In Sections 4 and 5 we discuss how to assess data quality and generate hypothesis based on association mining We evaluate our method in Section 6 using a real-world public health dataset Related work is discussed in Section 7 We conclude in Section 8 for association rule analysis as a directed graph is a set of association edges connecting multiple vertices as the consequent part also called the head For example the association 215blood vessel feature heart rate hypertensive diseases\216 is shown in Figure 1 which involves three vertices Semantically an association edge means 215associated-with\216 In practice an edge often can be labeled with more speci\223c relations such as 215result-of\216 215indicate\216 etc If we know what values of these attributes take an association edge can represent one or multiple association rules edges connecting two vertices denotes a subclass-superclass relation with as the parent is a label set labels are speci\223ed by end-users A is a set of attribute-value pairs and 267\267\267 267\267\267 267\267\267 267\267\267 267\267\267  u u V We de\223ne a semantic network      k n n n n 2 2 2 2 2   as the child and V A H S T 200 a  1 1 1 1 1 1 2 i n i i i V a a a a  SN SN v v v  V 267\267\267  005 005  004        KNOWN,BASIC       v Anedge 200 004 005 004 200  200  1 V is-a   200 A H S T V A  v v u v H v u S A T KNOWN KNOWN KNOWN orboth i        BASIC BASIC BASIC v v v u v u v v v v v u u n v v v v

In 1999 the Heartfelt study was conducted to collect data on adolescent health The target population for this study was African European and Hispanic American adolescents aged 11 16 years residing in a large metropolitan city in southeast Texas with an ethnically diverse population 383 adolescents were recruited and the collected data included totally 105 attributes and 16912 records The attributes include age gender ethnic/racial group physical maturity resting blood pressure and heart rate ambulatory blood pressure heart rate and moods reported at 30-minute intervals body mass index fat free mass psychological characteristics such as anger and hostility Numerous 223ndings have been reported based on bio-statistical analysis of the Heartfelt study such as stress-induced alterations of blood pressure association of obesity and poor sleep quality ethnic group di\002erences in moods and ambulatory blood pressure relationship of am bulatory blo o d pressure to physical activity etc Uni\223ed Medical Language System UMLS is designed to help an information system 215understand\216 the meanings of concepts and terms and their relationships in biomedical and health domain The UMLS Knowledge Sources are multi-purpose and can be used to create process retrieve integrate and aggregate biomedical and health information UMLS divides medical ontology knowledge into three sources the SPECIALIST lexicon the Metathesaurus and the Semantic Network The SPECIAL5 size NewHypotheses attribute Data Quality Metric 1 Data Quality Metric 2 Public health monitoring and analysis is very important to national policy makers and general public Public health data is generally of large volume noisy and high-dimensional which is an ideal testbed for data mining techniques Therefore we chose a public health data set collected in the Heartfelt study as our case study All experiments were performed on a Pentium 4 3.0GHz PC running Windows XP We used the Apriori algorithm implemented in Weka 3.4  to generate asso ciation rules x N N errors/missing values objectivity believability Among these properties what directly a\002ect the quality of association rules are 1 whether the amount of collected data is appropriate If the collected data is not enough to approximate the 215true\216 scenario precisely we will get many wrong or coincident rules false negative 2 whether the set of data attributes is semantically coherent An association rule is valid only if the attributes in the rule are semantically relevant Rules generated by semantically isolated attributes will likely be coincident instead of valid A poorly designed experiment with many isolated attributes will miss many useful and interesting rules false positive Let denote the number of rules of type We calculate the ratio of the number of semantically valid rules to the number of nontrivial rules The intuition is that the larger a dataset is the more closely it should re\224ect the basic domain principles and the less semantically incorrect rules will be generated Since the hypotheses are generated by replacing original attributes with semantically similar attributes children siblings in the rules the more new hypotheses we get the more semantically incomplete the original attribute set is unknown and correct 212 NewHypotheses 6 A Case Study 6.1 The Heartfelt Study 6.2 Building a Semantic Network from UMLS to Analyze the Heartfelt Study To measure these two factors we propose the following metrics N x Q Q     N N N N BB4 KnownCorrect U nknownCorrect nontrivial U nknownCorrect rules 


BB\021 and specify trivial attribute-value pairs In our experiment we add 215associated-with\216 edges that should be known by general public such as 215body mass index is associated with obesity\216 215age is associated with sexual maturity\216 etc Trivial attribute-value pairs are generally not interesting to medical personnel such as 215obesity  no\216 215blood pressure normal\216,etc It took us about two hours to set up this semantic network Although actual time can vary from one dataset to another and from one user to another user once the semantic network is set up it can be reused by other users and revised to analyze similar datasets BASIC ZBMI is associated with Maternal obesity syndrome KNOWN is low and indicates that the dataset is small which is common in biomedical 223eld due to the prohibitive data collecting cost A small 6 is-a ZBMI is the z-score of body mass index that measures obesity and it is reasonable that ZBMI relates to maternal obesity syndrome These hypothesis should be of high quality since they are based on the rules generated from real data and validated by the basic biomedical principles speci\223ed in our semantic network We calculated IST lexicon is designed to provide lexical information for the SPECIALIST Natural Language Processing System The Metathesaurus is a multi-lingual vocabulary database that contains de\223nitions of biomedical terms their various names such as synonyms and abbreviations and the relationships among them The Semantic Network categorizes all concepts in the Metathesaurus into semantic types such as clinical 223nding organisms physical activity etc The Semantic Network also de\223nes a set of relationships between biomedical concepts These relationships provide the structure for the Semantic Network The primary relationship is the 215is-a\216 link which establishes the hierarchy within the Semantic Network Besides there are also a set of non-hierarchical relationships e.g 215associated-with\216 215a\002ect\216 215functionally related to\216 Using UMLS we created a semantic network for the Heartfelt dataset as follows a fragment of the semantic network is shown in Figure 1 1 Analyze the attributes in the Heartfelt dataset assign the attributes that are semantically similar to the same vertex e.g 215age of subject in years\216 and 215age of subject in months\216 are assigned to one vertex and totally we obtain 39 vertices 2 Extract parent and child concepts totally 162 of the original attributes from UMLS and add these new concepts and their relations into the semantic network As shown in Figure 1 majority of concepts are organized into the 215observable entity\216 tree and 215clinical 223nding\216 tree 3 Find the semantic type of each attribute using UMLS Di\002erent concepts can have the same semantic type and we found totally 9 semantic types UMLS provides 49 relations among these semantic types and they were added into the network as 215associated-with\216 or more speci\223c edges e.g 215a\002ect\216 and 215indicate\216 and labeled with and Q Q Q   Q Q  4 Ask a user to add additional 215associated-with\216 edges labeled with 36 07 The value of accordingtotwo metrics proposed in Section 5 We applied our hypothesis generation method to the association rules generated from Heartfelt dataset and totally we generated 1920 new hypotheses for further investigation These hypotheses point out new attributes that a user may collect in future experiments These hypotheses introduced new attributes siblings and children of original attributes excluded if they already exist we do not have any real values for these attributes Instead these hypotheses describe possible correlations among semantically relevant attributes For example 6.3 Experiment Results and Discussion size size size 0 0 attribute attribute
