Researchers\nmust now carefully determine how to store, transfer and analyze\n“Big Data” in collaborative environments. This task is even more\ncomplicated when considering budget and locality constraints\non data storage and access. In this paper we investigate the\npotential to construct a Social Content Delivery Network \(S-CDN model builds upon the incentives of collaborative\nresearchers within a given scienti?c community to address their\ndata challenges collaboratively and in proven trusted settings. In\nthis paper we present a prototype implementation of a S-CDN\nand investigate the performance of the data transfer mechanisms\n\(using Globus Online been observed in\nmany scienti?c domains as a means of facilitating collabo-\nration. Increasingly social networks are used to coordinate\nresearch communities. Two examples are MyExperiment [1]\nand nanoHub [2], for the bioinformatics and nanoscience\ncommunities respectively. Both enable users to share data\nand processes and even execute scienti?c applications on\ndistributed resources, and both leverage their own proprietary\nsocial networks between users. There are also many examples\nof portal frameworks that enable community collaboration for\nexperiment management, e.g., RunMyCode.org \(for supporting\nreproducibility of results generally con-\nsisting of Web-based interfaces for accessing HPC and data\nresources allow scientists to access\ndata, perform computations, and interact with community-\nowned resources using web-based interfaces to run simulations\nand analyze data. We believe that similar socially oriented ap-\nproaches towards collaboration can be applied to the problems\nassociated with research data distribution and delivery.\nScienti?c collaborations are increasingly data intensive,\nand in many cases, data sizes exceed the storage capacity read-\nily available to researchers. Due to the size of so called ”Big\nData”, datasets are often no longer stored locally, but rather\nin data warehouses and storage clouds where storage capacity\nis limited only by a user’s willingness to pay. However, these\napproaches are not without limitations, for instance, the cost\nof cloud storage may become prohibitive with large datasets\nor when data must be frequently transferred, users may be\nunwilling to trust cloud providers with their sensitive data, and\nlatency may prevent users having access to data on demand.\nIn the context of collaborative eScience, large datasets must\nbe carefully distributed to support high performance, reliable,\nand trustworthy access by a wide group of users. In [3] we\nproposed the use of a Social Content Delivery Network \(S-\nCDN relationships between researchers\nto create a “trustworthy” CDN fabric on which large scienti?c\ndata can be hosted and accessed by researchers. In this model,\nsocial networks are leveraged as a means to authenticate\nusers, to identify locations within a scienti?c community for\ntrustworthy data storage, and to provide high availability and\nef?cient access to datasets. Members of a scienti?c community\ncontribute storage resources to act as nodes within a content\ndelivery network for caching, temporary, as well as persistent\nstorage. Each user allocates a portion of their hard disk or\nstorage server \(e.g., a directory or folder delivery system itself.\nIn this paper we describe our ?rst steps in implement-\ning a S-CDN. In this prototype we construct a CDN layer\nusing Globus Online’s transfer functionalities, and a custom\nservice to distribute data across the network leveraging users\nrelationships with one another. To evaluate our approach we\ncompare the speed of data transfer between our model \(using\nGlobus Online Dropbox\nand Amazon S3. We also brie?y compare the cost of using\nthese approaches and demonstrate the potential advantages of\nthe proposed approach.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we\noutline the proposed S-CDN model for Scienti?c Content\nDelivery and Sharing. In Section III, we present the prototype\nimplementation of a S-CDN. In Section IV, we investigate the\nperformance of the S-CDN prototype and discuss the potential\neconomic bene?ts of using such an approach. In Section V,\nwe discuss related work Finally, in Section VI, we summarize\nthe paper and present our future work.\nII. SOCIAL DATA SHARING\nWe envisage a Social CDN \(S-CDN now common-\nplace constructs of social network platforms like Facebook,\n2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on e-Science\n978-0-7695-5083-1/13 $25.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/eScience.2013.52\n350\nFig. 1. S-CDN: Usage and Overview. Data followers of a user receive data\nupdates when the user shares a dataset with the S-CDN 


Allocation servers\ndetermine the most ef?cient placement and transfer of the dataset.\nGoogle+ and Twitter However, where the goal of social\nnetwork platforms is to enable interpersonal exchange and\ncommunication, the goal of a S-CDN is to facilitate data\nsharing and exchange in collaborative research. Example sce-\nnarios range from small scale or informal research projects\ninvolving a small number of researchers, e.g., a PhD project or\ninitial paper project, to large scale projects involving consortia\ncomposed of multiple institutions and individuals, e.g., a multi-\nsite geosciences project involving dozens of different data\nsources or a ’citizen science’ -based investigation involving\nhundreds of contributors.\nThe concept of a S-CDN [3] builds upon the idea of\na Social Cloud [4], [5]: “a resource and service sharing\nframework utilizing relationships established between members\nof a social network.” In a Social Cloud, users connect with\ntheir peers to exchange resources in a Cloud-like manner. This\ncan, for example, be realized in the construction of a Social\nCompute Cloud [6], a Social Data Cloud [4], [5], or a Social\nCloud for collaborative eResearch [7]. A S-CDN ?ts into the\nSocial Cloud landscape through the exchange of data \(sharing infrastructure to support the exchange\nand collaboration processes.\nFig. 1 illustrates the S-CDN model. Here a user has\nrun an experiment as part of a collaborative project and the\nuser now wants to share the results with their collaborators.\nThe basic notion of a Social Cloud in this setting would\nconstitute a backup action being performed by the user using\nthe storage resources of a their social peers, similar to that of\na Dropbox storage action. In a S-CDN, however, the backup\naction is secondary to the action of sharing and distributing\ndata amongst collaborators. Fig. 1 depicts four key aspects that\ndifferentiate the S-CDN use case from other forms of CDNs,\nP2P networks, ?le sharing, and collaboration approaches:\nData Follower Circles: A user has one or more sets of\n“Data Followers”, denoted here as a Data Follower Circle.\nA data follower is similar to a Twitter follower: a user that\nfollows status updates and data posts of a given user. However,\nin contrast to Twitter, a data follower must be authorized by\na user in order to control access to the user’s data. There\nare, however, different policy approaches that could be used\nas a proxy for explicit authorization, such as an existing\ndigital relationship within a social network platform, a given\nFig. 2 S-CDN Architecture. Users register with the S-CDN service, which\nuses a social network adapter to store relationships with other users. The S-\nCDN service determines replica placement based on relationships between\nusers and leverages Globus Online to transfer ?les between users and storage\nendpoints.\nrelationship type \(e.g., colleague, close friend etc speci?ed\nfriend list \(in Facebook in Google reciprocally follow their data\nfollowers or that this process should be automated. Therefore,\nlike circles in Google+, a follower-followee connection is not\nconsidered bilateral. However, the relationship between these\nusers must be bilaterally authorized .\nData Status Update: In order to share data, a user appends\nthe data set to be shared \(via a social network application S-CDN what the\ndataset should be shared with what data follower circle, and in-\nvokes the S-CDN’s data transport and management algorithms.\nLikewise, when users access datasets status messages may also\nbe published to enable social interactions around data usage.\nResource Servers: A S-CDN differs from classic CDNs at\nits resource layer. In a S-CDN, storage resources are directories\nlocated on the edge devices owned \(and therefore contributed are used to share and access data, and\nalso as temporary hosts for others’ data within the network.\nAllocation Servers: An integral part of the CDN plat-\nform is its overlay: the allocation servers, which perform all\ndata management actions. These actions include instantiating\ndata movement to/from followees and followers as back-ups,\ncaches, and repositories. The infrastructure to support the\nplatform may either be performed by a trusted third party,\nor through a co-operative collaboration infrastructure [8].\nIII. ARCHITECTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION\nOur implementation of a S-CDN leverages Globus On-\nline \(GO performance data\ntransfer between CDN nodes and users, a Django based web\napplication and associated database to store and manage users\n351\nand allocate storage across the network, and social network\nintegration to gain access to relationships between users.\nFig. 2 shows the S-CDN prototype architecture. As a\nrequirement of joining the S-CDN every user has to ?rst set\nup a GO endpoint, which is shared with the S-CDN. This\nendpoint provides access to the user’s storage resources both\nas a means of uploading/downloading datasets from the S-\nCDN and also for temporary replica placement. The user\nthen has to register with the S-CDN via Facebook \(1 and\nallow the application access to their friends and friend lists\n\(2 most commonly\nused social network; other social networks could also be inte-\ngrated in a similar manner. The S-CDN agent collects pro?le\ninformation about the user \(3 of the standard Facebook friend lists\n‘Close Friends’ and ‘Family’. The S-CDN allocation algorithm\ndetermines 


a relationship score \(4 the\nreplica placement algorithms when determining where to place\nreplicas. The assumption here is that close friends may be more\nwilling to host their friends’ datasets and they may also be\nmore likely to be accessing similar datasets. The relationship\nscore is calculated by multiplying factors for the user their\nrelationships, their groups and their interactions in the S-\nCDN. Currently the relationship score algorithm considers the\nnumber of downloads of a user’s datasets. Steps \(2 4 to the S-CDN website. Relationship\ninformation is periodically updated when users log in to the\nS-CDN website or service. All information about the user,\nincluding mappings to other users and relationship scores is\nstored in a database \(5 6 stored in the database. The user\nmay select any dataset on one of their registered endpoints to\nshare with their S-CDN followers. Likewise they may choose\nto download their followees’ datasets to any one of their\nregistered endpoints. The user can choose to register a dataset\nwith the S-CDN \(7 registered by locating a root\ndirectory on one of the user’s registered endpoints. When a\ndataset is added the S-CDN grouping algorithm \(8 current\nimplementation, three possible subsets of all users exist: All\nusers, every user known in Facebook Facebook ‘friends replica endpoints are selected, the\ninformation on the locations of the new replicas are stored in\nthe database \(9 10 each of the\nselected replica endpoints \(11 owner through an assisted\nsearch or by a unique URL. Currently, the S-CDN simply\nselects a replica at random and initiates a GO transfer. As\nsoon as we deviate from the ‘man in the midde’ approach and\nuse GO’s sharing system, all transfers will occur transparently\nand asynchronously, and users will be noti?ed of successful\ntransfers and errors through GO noti?cations.\nContinuing the social theme of the application, the S-\nCDN application includes a ‘news’ page that shows the recent\nactions of friends, including registration of endpoints and\ndatasets as well as downloads of datasets. This page allows\nfollowers to monitor the actions of their followees, and it\nalso serves as a record of a user’s actions within the S-\nCDN, providing a means for other users to also download\nand view interesting datasets that have been uploaded, used,\nor downloaded by their friends.\nA. Storage Repositories and Transfer\nThe S-CDN model is based upon users contributing storage\nresources to facilitate the CDN layer. Access to, and transfer\nbetween, users’ storage resources is provided by GO. We\nchoose GO as it provides reliable and high performance\ndata transfers between third party endpoints, that is, the S-\nCDN agent can start a transfer between two remote endpoints\nwithout needing to manage the transfer, and if faults occur,\nsuch as users’ endpoints going of?ine, GO will continue to\nretry the transfer when the endpoint returns online. GO is\nimplemented following a Software-as-a-Service \(SaaS model,\nin which the main capabilities are provided to users through a\nthin web client and a REST API. In its standard model, GO\nallows authenticated access to an endpoint to users with valid\naccounts on the speci?ed endpoint. More recently, GO has\nreleased a beta version of a sharing service1 that enables users\nto share access to ?les and directories on endpoints directly\nwithout requiring physical accounts on the host. The S-CDN\narchitecture makes use of these new sharing capabilities to\nenable users to share parts of their storage resources with the\nS-CDN itself. To do so, users are required to con?gure a shared\nendpoint and share read and write access with the S-CDN user\n\(‘scdnagent the speci?ed directory to the S-CDN, which\nin turn enables it to transfer data to and from the endpoint.\nThis approach was chosen because we did not want to just\nuse the service to enact a social network, although this would\nhave been possible, because we believe the capabilities of\nsocial networks like Facebook to ultimately be more ?exible.\nThis is why a user has to share his endpoint with a ‘man in\nthe middle’, which allows it to restrict access to other users’\nendpoints while still being able to move data freely.\nWhile this model may resemble a Peer-To-Peer \(P2P endpoints and therefore submission of transfer requests is\npossible from anywhere, not only from a node in the structure;\nreplication is done by the S-CDN rather than sharing datasets\nthat have been explicitly downloaded by others in the network;\nand general management is performed by a centralized service.\nB. Allocation Server\nThe allocation server is at the center of the S-CDN. It\nadds network structure to the GO infrastructure by storing\ninformation on registered users, speci?cally mappings between\nS-CDN users, their Facebook IDs their friends and datasets.\nThe allocation server is implemented as a service to enable\nusers to interact with the S-CDN through its REST API and\nweb site. In order to provide these services reliably, the S-CDN\nis currently hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. We used the\npopular web framework for Python ‘Django’, and 


deployed\nvia WSGI on an Apache HTTP Server. All our information\nis stored in a database, for which we used MySQL. Django\n1https://www.globusonline.org/plus/\n352\nFig. 3. S-CDN Website showing the data sharing screen.\nmakes storing data in the database convenient: corresponding\nwith Object Relational Mapping, we used the user models\ngiven by Django and de?ned our own models for endpoints,\ndatasets, replica locations relationships, downloads and events\nin the S-CDN. Django saves all information on models in their\nrespective tables. In terms of scalability, the implementation\nallows us to easily add additional application and database\nservers to scale with increasing number of users and requests.\nThe GO backend is also highly scalable and enables execution\nof many concurrent transfers. The allocation server integrates\nwith existing social networks and enables invocation of arbi-\ntrary replica placement and retrieval algorithms as described\nin the following sections.\nC. Social Middleware\nTo extract the social relationships needed for the S-CDN,\nwe use the Django ‘django social auth’ module. This module\nenables association of a user’s arbitrary social network account\n\(for instance Facebook social network provider\nas it is the most commonly used social network; however, other\nsocial networks can also be easily integrated into our model.\nWhen a user associates their Facebook account with their S-\nCDN account, they are asked to give delegated access to the S-\nCDN application following the OAuth protocol. This delegated\npermissions allows the S-CDN application to access various\nparts of the user’s online pro?le \(e.g their friends and friend\nlists the user’s Facebook ID and their S-CDN\nuser account. Using this token the S-CDN retrieves the user’s\npro?le information, their friends, and any friend lists through\nthe Facebook Graph API. These lists are then compared against\nexisting S-CDN users and only relationships with friends that\nare also members of the S-CDN are stored in the database. All\nsocial information is periodically updated when users log into\nthe S-CDN.\nD. Replica Placement\nThe current S-CDN prototype places complete replicas\nof each dataset on randomly selected available endpoints of\nthe dataset’s owner’s friends \(followers the number of nodes selected for replication valid ?rst approach, as even in small\ncommunities only one replica of a desired dataset has to\nbe online for a request to be satis?ed. This is even more\ntrue in our scienti?c context, as many servers will be almost\nalways online. However, since GO endpoints may be set up\non machines with entirely different online behaviors, such as\nlaptops and dedicated storage servers, and the online time\nof peers correlates to some degree, availabilty and access of\ndatasets will have to scale to the requirements. Which is why\nthe replication factor should be increased to deliver higher\nquality of service. For larger datasets it may be impractical\nto replicate entire datasets both due to limitations on total\nstorage space and also the time to access entire datasets. We\nwill investigate the ability to replicate only partial datasets,\nsimilar to the mechanisms used in P2P networks and manage\ntheir allocation across the CDN. As the system is implemented\nas a service, it is not practical to execute allocation code on the\nendpoint’s host machine. Instead, all allocation decisions are\nmade by the allocation server itself. This approach restricts\nthe direct use of computational intensive algorithms such as\nerasure codes.\nE. Replica Selection\nSimilarly to allocation, the S-CDN must select a replica\nfrom which to download a dataset. At present this selection\nis also done at random. However we plan to explore various\ndifferent algorithms. We intend to investigate metrics such as\nlocality, bandwidth, and social relationship \(trust s EVALUATION\nOur evaluation of the S-CDN prototype focuses on the\nperformance of the data transfer mechanisms used and the\npotential cost to a user of deploying such a model. We compare\nboth of these aspects against two existing cloud providers\nDropbox and Amazon S3.\nA. Data Transfer Performance\nSince we selected GO as our underlying transfer tech-\nnology due to its design for provide high performance data\ntransfer, we compare the transfer rates of different cloud\nstorage services to GO when uploading and downloading\ndatasets of various sizes. To fairly compare these different\nsystems we implemented a transfer client that leverages the\n3 systems’ published APIs and deployed it at the University\nof Chicago. We then created different datasets and measured\nthe total time to upload and download data to a Dropbox\naccount hosted on Amazon S3, an Amazon S3 bucket and a GO\nendpoint hosted in Amazon EC2. While this is not a perfectly\nfair comparison as we do not know the internal speci?cations\nof the cloud storage provides, we believe this analysis provides\na general basis from which to compare these approaches. Each\nof these systems have been evaluated with respect to three\ndifferent types of datasets that are typical of scienti?c data: a\nlarge number of tiny ?les, a medium number of medium sized\n?les, and one large ?le. As the S-CDN is designed to target\nvarious scienti?c communities, we assume that their datasets\nwill be of a similar nature to one of these datasets.\nAs Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show, GO performs best for all three\ndatasets, with exceptional performance for large amounts

The\nresults for Dropbox upload and download for the 1 GB ?le\nare not shown as we were unable to upload and download\nsuch a large ?le using the Dropbox Core API. We also did not\ngo beyond this number of ?les \(1000x1KB problems using commercial cloud solutions for\nlarge datasets is the prohibitive cost of storage. To investigate\nthe potential advantages of the S-CDN model, we brie?y\nexplore the costs associated with hosting a 1 TB scienti?c\ndataset on each of these platforms. Table I shows the cost of\nstorage and data transfer using each of these approaches. All\nvalues are obtained from the respective published websites.\nAn enterprise account for Dropbox amounts to $795 per\nyear, accepts up to 5 users and the size of the storage is not\n?xed Backup and version history are included. Hosting 1 TB\nof data on Amazon S3 costs $96.81 per month and 1161.72\nper year. Additional charges for PUT and GET requests apply,\nas do for data transfer. As an example of these costs, copying\nthe entire 1 TB dataset would cost an additional $20.48. The\ncalculations in the table also include the adjusted cost if the\nentire dataset was also copied once per month. As Dropbox\ndoes not charge for transfers it would still cost $95 while\nAmazon S3 would cost $1407.48 for a single account and a\ntotal of $6322.68 for ?ve accounts \(in comparison to Dropbox users 5 1 unlimited unlimited\nUp-front cost - - 257 700\nCost per year \(1 TB energy COSTS \(US constructed\nusing a lightweight host such as a Raspberry Pi2 \(RPi place \(such as is the\ncase in a university or research lab roughly compares to a Amazon EC2\nmicro instance in terms of RAM and CPU at the price of about\n$43 on Amazon.com. A ?ash card for about $8 and a charger\nfor about $6 have to be acquired separately. A Western Digital\n4 TB hard disk for storage costs about $200, the size of which\nis based on the assumption that other users would want to\nutilize storage on this node for replica placement. The energy\nintake of a RPi is 3.5 W which amounts over the course of\none year to 30.66 kWh. The hard disk consumes 18 W, which\nequates to 157.68 kWh per year. At the US average price of\n$0.128 per kWh we expect this infrastructure to cost $24.10\nfor energy at full load for a year. Assuming the infrastructure\ncan be used for 2 years \(based on the shortest warranty period\nof its components more viable, endpoint setup could\nutilize a desktop PC. The typical price for a low-end PC is\napproximately 500, plus $200 for a 4 TB hard drive. This\namounts to up front costs of $700. Again we assume network\naccess to be already in place. A PC based system can run for\nas low as 90 W, which amounts to 788.400 kWh per year or\n$100.92. Using our assumptions of running the structure for 2\nyears, this amounts to a total price per year of $450.92.\nTherefore the Raspberry Pi and PC based systems could\nrun for double the time at less cost than either of the cloud\nsystems considered. While the other cloud solutions may have\nadditional services, the S-CDN mode also includes backups\nintrinsically as replicas are stored on other endpoints.\nV. RELATED WORK\nCommercial CDNs such as Akamai, Amazon CloudFront,\nand Limelight implement an infrastructure with thousands of\ndedicated resources geographically located to assure reliable\naccess and high bandwidth to data For this reason, using these\nkinds of services is usually expensive and therefore infeasible\nfor research-scale data. Open source approaches such as Coral\nCDN allow one to create personal P2P-based CDNs without\nthe need to pay a provider, yet the costs to implement an\ninfrastructure that supports a scalable distributed network are\nquite signi?cant in themselves.\nFriendBox [9] aims to provide a service similar in its\npurpose to the S-CDN proposed in this paper. The most\nsigni?cant difference between our approaches is that Friendbox\naugments storage capacity and availability by using commer-\ncial providers when the available friend based P2P storage is\n2http://www.raspberrypi.org/\n354\nnot suf?cient. There are also several small differences between\narchitectures, for example FriendBox is able to use erasure\ncodes because of a client present on the peers system, in\nour model we do not use a specialized CDN client on users’\nsystems. Due to the reliance on commercial providers, it\nis assumed that FriendBox would implement a hybrid cost\nmodel that is somewhere in between our model and that of a\ncommercial cloud provider. In a similar vein, MetaCDN [10],\n[11] offers the capability to create a CDN on top of different\nStorage Cloud providers, such as Amazon S3. MetaCDN is\nshown to be a low cost alternative to existing commercial op-\ntions, while providing similar functionality such as replication,\nfail-over, geographical load redirection, and load balancing.\nContent-as-a-service \(CoDaaS  uses cloud services\nto host and distribute user generated content through virtual\ncontent delivery services Dealing with a problem space that is\nsimilar to ours, CoDaaS concentrates its efforts on supporting\nuser generated content created by non-professional producer,\nthis content has unique hosting requirements that 


current CDNs\nare not able to provide. For example, the data’s long-tail nature\n\(most content is of low interest to most users content. CoDaaS builds a dynamic content distribution\ntree over a media cloud, with the intent to be cost- and QoS-\neffective.\nTo deal with privacy concerns in online social networks,\ndistributed social online networks DOSNs users’ peers’ systems, and\ntherefore leverage social trust for security. Prominent examples\ninclude Diaspora3 Peerson [13], My3 [14], and a DOSN\nSocial CDN [15]. The focus of our work is on data too\nbig for traditional CDNs, unlike the concepts behind these\nDSONs, but they do highlight the viability of our approach\nand also include content distribution algorithms that could be\nused in our approach. My3 replicates data across peers in\na way that a user’s content is only available to themselves\nand their friends, independent of online status. Updates are\nspread across peers until the pro?les are consistent. Requested\nreplicas \(or trusted proxy sets geographical location and online status. The Social\nCDN [15] consists of social caches [16] that are used to\ndistribute updates amongst friends. The approach is similar to\nour work in the aspect that it uses a social network topology\nrather than geographical location to form the CDN. Several\ndistributed selection algorithms are proposed to optimize cache\nselection and information distribution in DOSNs. The social\nscore algorithm is of particular relevance to our work, as it\nconsiders social network principles such as node centrality\ncomputed by each node to select social caches.\nAnother approach for bridging the gap between social and\noverlay networking is the social virtual private network \(So-\ncialVPN  establishment\nof peer-to-peer links between users that are connected through\na social network. This involves the discovery of peers and the\nidenti?cation of cryptographic public certi?cates \(e.g., X.509\ncerti?cates or X.509 certi?cate ?ngerprints examples span from Facebook\nmessages to encrypted Google talk chat sessions or PGP-\nsigned mail exchange. The authors demonstrate a prototype\nusing the IPOP virtual network across a variety of social\nnetworks \(Facebook the Drupal content management system, a\nPGP-signed email exchanges system SocialVPN routers across ?ve continents using the\nPlanetLab infrastructure, as well as over100 SocialVPN virtual\nendpoints deployed dynamically over the Amazon Elastic\nCloud \(EC2 supplement our\napproach, since a SocialVPN can be used to establish secure\nlinks between participants involved in a S-CDN.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nCollaborative scienti?c research increasingly relies upon\nlarge datasets contributed by a wide range of researchers spread\nacross the world. Researchers are faced with challenges asso-\nciated with ?nding, accessing and moving important datasets\nbefore they are able to conduct their research analyses. In\nthis paper, we investigate the potential use of a collaborative\ndata sharing model based upon social relationships between\nresearchers and a CDN overlay approach to improve data\navailability and provide scalable data storage. In this model,\nresearchers contribute storage resources to host data subsets\nused by others in their network. This approach has the ad-\nvantage of making research datasets available even as datasets\nbecome large and also amortizes the cost of storage across a\ngroup of collaborative workers.\nIn this paper, we described our initial prototype archi-\ntecture, including aspects such as the Django-based service\nand user interface, the data transfer layer based on Globus\nOnline, and initial data placement and retrieval approaches. We\ndemonstrated that this approach, when compared with other\ncommon cloud storage approaches, can be both cost effective\nand also faster.\nOur future work primarily focuses on developing replica\nplacement and retrieval algorithms to determine the “best”\nnode on which to store and retrieve datasets. We aim to\ninvestigate social strategies based on users’ relationships with\none another and also their standing in the research community.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWork by Katz was supported by the National Science\nFoundation while working at the Foundation; any opinion,\n?nding, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this\nmaterial are those of the author\(s Science Foundation.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration. This infonnation will be \nused to create a baseline behavior for comparison with \nactual data to discriminate between nonnal and abnormal nbehavior. \nTable 3 is a list of biological diagnostic measurements to be \nincluded in CCSDS telemetry available for ground \npersonnel to complete a prognostic analysis used to predict \nmental illness would be occurring in the near future. In the \nevent that the presence of accelerated aging is identified, \nindicating that mental illness will occur, changes to the \nenvironment to the environment can be made to prevent \nmental illness from occurring. \nTable 3 includes 3 5  measurements are from the circadian \nand ultranian rhythms including the value for the least \nsignificant bit \(LSB into telemetry in the CCSDS format and the \nexpected extreme range that the measurement will need to \nmeasure across and not be exceeded. The LSB value is \nimportant because it defines the smallest increment n\(resolution e.g. knowledge the \nmeasurement. The measurement range is important to defme \nthe 5th or 6th degree polynomial used to convert the 8-bit \ndigital words in telemetry back to analog telemetry so the \ntelemetry processing and display system can accurately \ndisplay the biological and engineering diagnostic \ninformation to ground personnel for analysis. \n1 7  \nTable 3 .

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
