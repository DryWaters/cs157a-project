Thus, the improvement\nof scalability and ef?ciency of recommender systems is also\nnecessary and urgent. In view of these challenges, a preference-\naware service recommendation method on Map-Reduce, named\nPASR, is proposed in this paper. It aims at presenting a per-\nsonalized ranking list and recommending the most appropriate\nservices to the users from big data environment. In this method,\nkeywords are used to indicate users’ preferences, and a user-\nbased Collaborative Filtering algorithm is adopted to generate\nappropriate recommendations. To improve the scalability and\nef?ciency of PASR, we implement it on a distributed computing\nplatform, Hadoop, which uses Map-Reduce as its computing\nframework. Finally, experimental results show that our approach\nperforms well both in accuracy and scalability.\nKeywords- recommender system, preference, keyword, big data,\nMap-Reduce Hadoop\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA. Background\nWith the growing number of alternative online services,\nrecommending services that users preferred effectively has\nbecome an important research issue. Service recommender\nsystems have shown to be valuable tools to help users deal with\nservices overload and provide appropriate recommendations\nto them. Examples of such practical applications include\nCDs, books, web pages and various other products now use\nrecommender systems [1], [2].\nAccording to the de?nition of recommender system in 3],\nservice recommender system can be de?ned as any system\nthat produces individualized recommendations as output or\nhas the effect of guiding the user in a personalized way to\ninteresting or useful services in a large space of possible\noptions. Recommender systems developed as an independent\nresearch area in the mid-1990s when recommendation prob-\nlems started focusing on the rating model [4], [5]. Over\nthe last decade there has been much research done both\nin industry and academia on developing new approaches for\nservice recommender systems [6], [7], [8]. Most recommender\nsystems are based on different service ranking methods to\nrecommend the best or best N services to the users. Current\nservice recommendation methods usually can be classi?ed into\nthree main categories: content-based, collaborative, and hybrid\nrecommendation approaches [9 Content-based approaches\nrecommend services similar to those the user preferred in the\npast Collaborative-?ltering approaches recommend services to\nthe user that users with similar tastes and preferences preferred\nin the past. Hybrid approaches combine content-based and\ncollaborative-?ltering methods in several different ways.\nIn recent years, the tremendous growth of the number of\ncustomers and services poses some key challenges for recom-\nmender systems. So the current service recommender systems\nstill need further improvements to make recommendations\nmore effective and scalable in big data environment. These im-\nprovements include utilization of multi-criteria ratings, better\nmethods for representing users preferences and the informa-\ntion about the services to be recommended. Incorporation of\nmore powerful processing platforms is also urgently needed\nto improve the scalability problem of recommender system.\nDistributed parallel computing is an effective way to solve the\nproblem of scalability and high computation complexity in\nbig data environment. Cloud computing can provide effective\nplatforms to facilitate parallel computing. There are several\ncloud computing software and tools available, such as Hadoop\n[10 Mahout [11], Map-Reduce of Google [12], the Dynamo\nof Amazon.com [13], the Dryad of Microsoft and Neptune\nof Ask.com [14] etc. Among these tools, Hadoop is the most\npopular open source cloud computing platform inspired by\nMap-Reduce and Google File System \(GFS  and\nmass data storage with good fault tolerance.\nB. Motivation\nIn most existing service recommender systems such as hotel\nreservation systems and restaurant guides, the ratings of the\nservices and the ranking lists presented to the users are the\nsame. They didn’t consider users’ different preferences, thus\ncould not meet users’ personalized requirements. Here, an\nexample in hotel reservation system is used to illustrate this:\n2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering\n978-0-7695-5096-1/13 31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CSE.2013.128\n846\nExample 1. Alice and Tom are browsing a hotel reservation\nwebsite to reserve a hotel in Kowloon, Hong Kong respectively.\nBut the ratings and ranking list of the hotels provided by the\nwebsite to them are the same. Assuming there are three hotels\nin Kowloon: A, B and C. Comparing the three hotels, A is\nconvenient to the airport and has a shopping mall nearby;\nB has convenient transportation with an underground station\nnearby and owns comfortable accommodation equipment; the\nbreakfast and food of C is delicious and its view is very good.\nAccording to the overall ratings provided by the 


website, B is\nbetter than A and A is better than C. However, in this travel,\nAlice prefers a shopping mall near the hotel and good location,\nwhile Tom is concerned about food and wishes good view\naround the hotel. So hotel B may not be the best choice for\nthem, and hotel A and C may be more appropriate to Alice\nand Tom respectively.\nSo the problem is how to provide Alice and Tom a personal-\nized ranking list respectively to recommend the most appropri-\nate hotels to them ef?ciently. As shown in Fig.1 \(a b reviews of W Hong Kong hotel snapshotted\nfrom a well-known travel review site \(www.tripadvisor.com Fig.1, we can see that user ua prefers modern feel\nand delicious food, while another user ub is concerned more\nabout good location, great service, breakfast, shopping and\nconvenient transportation. We know that the reviews of the\nusers commented for the hotels are related with both their\npreferences and the quality of the hotels. So the review of ub\nto is useful to both Alice and Tom, while the review of ua is\nuseful to Tom only since the review of ua is irrelevant to the\npreferences of Alice.\n\(a b hotel\nMotivated by this observation, in this paper, we propose\na preference-aware service recommendation method, named\nPASR, which is based on a user-based Collaborative Filtering\nalgorithm. To improve the scalability and ef?ciency of our\nmethod in big data environment, we implement it on a dis-\ntributed computing platform, Hadoop, which uses Map-Reduce\nas its computing framework.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section\nII presents the preliminary knowledge of our method. Then\na preference-aware service recommendation method on Map-\nReduce, named PASR, is described in Section III. In Section\nIV, experiments are designed and implemented to evaluate\nthe performance of our method. Related works are presented\nin Section V Finally, Section VI gives conclusions and an\noutlook on possible continuations of our work.\nII. PRELIMINARY KNOWLEDGE\nIn this section, we provide the preliminary knowledge of\nour method: user-based Collaborative Filtering algorithm and\noverview of Map-Reduce.\nA. User-based Collaborative Filtering Algorithm\nCollaborative Filtering \(CF many\ncommercial recommender systems [9]. In CF based systems,\nusers receive recommendations based on people who have\nsimilar tastes and preferences, which can be further classi?ed\ninto user-based CF and item-based CF In user-based systems,\nthe prediction of the rating of an item for a user will depend\nupon the ratings of the same item rated by similar users. While\nin item-based systems, the predicted rating depends on the\nratings of other similar items by the same user. In this work,\nwe take advantage of a user-based CF algorithm to deal with\nour problem. Fig.2 gives the work?ow of a user-based CF\nalgorithm, which can be described in detail as follows:\nFig. 2. The work?ow of a user-based CF algorithm\n\(1 is to\nmake recommendations for the user based on the likeness of\nother users who have similar taste. So the preferences of the\nactive user and the past users for the items should be collected\n?rstly.\n\(2 computation: Identifying the past users who\nhave similar taste with the user is crucial in CF algorithm,\nwhich is to ?nd neighborhoods for the user based on the\nsimilarity of their preferences.\n\(3 generation: Once the most similar\nusers are found, the predicted rating of each item for the user\ncan be calculated. Finally, the item\(s s Map-Reduce\nMap-Reduce [12] is a popular distributed implementation\nmodel proposed by Google, which is inspired by the Lisp pro-\ngramming language map and reduce operations. Map-Reduce\nframework consists of two phrases map phase and reduce\nphase. The input of the computation is a set of < key, value >\n847\npairs and the output is also a set of < key, value > pairs. The\nprocesses can be speci?ed by the following two functions:\nMapper k1, v1 >? list < k2, v2 >\nReducer :< k2, list < v2 >>? list < k3, v3 >\nIn the map phase, the map functions are executed in parallel\nwith various splits of the input data which is stored in a\ndistributed ?le system \(DFS The Map-Reduce library groups\ntogether all intermediate values associated with the same\nintermediate key I and passes them to the reduce function. In\nthe reduce phase, the reduce function accepts an intermediate\nkey I and a set of values for that key. It merges these values\ntogether to form a possibly smaller set of values.\nBesides the map and reduce phase, developers are also\nallowed to program a combine phase which is processed\nbetween map phase and reduce phase but executed on the\nsame node as the mapper function. The combined function\naims to reduce the communication load through the network\namong clusters by operating the local pairs.\nIII. A PREFERENCE-AWARE SERVICE RECOMMENDATION\nMETHOD ON MAP-REDUCE\nIn this paper, we propose a preference-aware service rec-\nommendation method on Map-Reduce, named PASR. In this\nmethod, keywords are used to indicate users’ preferences, and\na user-based CF algorithm is adopted to generate appropriate\nrecommendations. It aims at calculating a personalized rating\nof each candidate service for each user, then a personalized\nranking list of all the services will be presented to each user. To\nimprove the scalability and ef?ciency of our recommendation\nmethod, we implement PASR in a Map-Reduce framework on\nHadoop by splitting the proposed algorithm into four Map-\nReduce phases. Without loss of generality, we assume that 


the\nservices with higher ratings are more preferable to the user, so\nthe service\(s s will be recommended\nto the user.\nA. A Preference-Aware Service Recommendation Method\nA preference-aware service recommendation method, PAS-\nR, is presented in this section. The main steps of this method\nare described in detail as follows. Table I summarizes the\nfrequently used symbols.\n1. Capture user preference:\nIn our method, a keyword-candidate list and specialized\ndomain thesaurus are given to help obtain users preferences.\nThe active user can give his/her preferences for the services\nby selecting the keywords from the keyword-candidate list. In\nthis paper, the active user refers to the current user needed\nto be recommended The preferences of the past users can be\nextracted from their reviews for the services according to the\nkeyword-candidate list and the domain thesaurus.\na give\nhis/her preferences about the services by selecting the key-\nwords from the keyword-candidate list, which re?ect the qual-\nity criteria he/she concerned about. The keyword-candidate list\nis a set of keywords about the quality criteria of the services,\nTABLE I\nFREQUENT SYMBOLS\nSymbol De?nition\nK The keyword-candidate list K={k1,k2,...,kn}\nAm the pair-wise comparison matrix, Am=\(aij user\nRK a review keyword set of a review for a service\nsim\(UK,RK vector of a keyword set W=[w1,w2,...,wn]\nwrki\nthe weight of the keyword rki in a review\nkeyword set\nwhich can be denoted as K = {k1, k2, ..., kn}, n is the number\nof the keywords in the keyword-candidate list. The keywords\nin the keyword-candidate list could be a word or several words\nrelated with the quality criteria of the services. An example of\na simple keyword-candidate list of the hotel reservation system\nis described in Table II.\nTABLE II\nAN EXAMPLE OF THE KEYWORD-CANDIDATE LIST OF HOTEL\nRESERVATION SYSTEM\nNo. Keyword No Keyword No. Keyword\n1 Service 7 Transportation 13 Airport, Train\n2 Room 8 Family, Friends 14 Wi-Fi\n3 Shopping 9 Location 15 Environment\n4 Cleanliness 10 View 16 Bar\n5 Food 11 Quiet 17 Beach\n6 Value 12 Fitness\nBesides The active user should also select the importance\ndegree of the keywords. The importance degree of the key-\nwords is shown in Table III: “1” represents the general, “3”\nrepresents important and “5” represents very important.\nThe keyword set about the active user’s preferences can be\ndenoted as UK = {uk1, uk2, ..., ukl where uki\(1 ? i ? l number of the keywords selected.\nTABLE III\nIMPORTANCE DEGREE OF THE KEYWORDS\nImportance degree 1 3 5\nMeasurement general important very important\nb pref-\nerences of the past users can be extracted from their reviews\nfor the services according to the keyword-candidate list and\n848\ndomain thesaurus. Each review could be transformed into a\nkeyword set.\n Preprocess: Firstly, html tags and stop words [16], [27]\nin the reviews snippet collection should be removed to avoid\naffecting the quality of the keyword extraction in the next\nstage.\n• Keyword extraction: In this phase, we will extract key-\nwords from the reviews. In fact, the words in the reviews\nmay be not exactly the same as the keywords in the keyword-\ncandidate list, but they characterize the same aspects. So in this\npaper specialized domain thesauruses for different domains\nare built to support the keyword extraction. An example of\na simple domain thesaurus of hotel reservation system is\nshown in Fig. 3. The domain thesaurus is associated with the\nkeyword-candidate list. Thus the reviews can be transformed\ninto keyword sets more accurately according to the domain\nthesaurus. For example, if a review of a hotel has the word\n“spa”, which characterizes the same aspect as the keyword\n“Fitness”, then the keyword “Fitness” should be contained in\nthe keyword set of the review. Actually, various factors, such\nas synonyms, different forms of a word, should be considered\nin real domain thesauruses of our experiments, Fig. 3 is\njust a simple example. After the process a review can be\ntransformed into a set of keywords which can be denoted as\nRK = {rk1, rk2, ..., rkh} , where rki\(1 ? i ? h work, a review is equivalent to its corresponding\nreview keyword set. For convenience, in the following dis-\ncussion, the keyword set about the active user’s preferences\nand the keyword set of a review are called as the preference\nkeyword set and a review keyword set respectively.\n2. Similarity computation:\nThe second step is to identify the reviews of the past users\nwho have similar tastes to the active user, which is to nd\nneighborhoods for the active user based on the similarity of\ntheir preferences.\nBefore similarity computation, we should ?lter out the\nreviews having nothing to do with the active user’s preferences\nby the intersection concept in set theory. If the intersection of\nthe preference keyword set of the active user and a review\nkeyword set is an empty set, then the review keyword set\nshould be ?ltered out.\nA most frequently used similarity computation method is\napplied into our recommendation method: a cosine-based\napproach [18], which is similar to the Vector Space Model\n\(VSM  representing text documents \(and any objects, in\ngeneral ap-\nproach, the preference keyword set of the active user and\nthe review keyword sets of past users should be 


transformed\ninto n-dimensional weight vectors, which can be denoted as\nW = [w1, w2, ..., wn], n is the number of keywords in the\nkeyword-candidate list, wi is the weight of the keyword ki. If\nthe keyword ki in the keyword-candidate list is not contained\nin the keyword set, the weight of ki is 0, i.e., wi in the weight\nvector of the keyword set is 0.\nIn our method, we use the mathematical property of An-\nalytic hierarchy process \(AHP is provided by Saaty in 1970s to choose the best\nsatis?ed business role for its hierarchy nature [20], [21 The\nmathematical property of AHP model makes the weight of the\nkeywords more objective than the subjective ones. The weight\ncomputing based on the AHP model is described as follows:\nFirstly, we construct the pair-wise comparison matrix in\nterms of the relative importance between each two factors.\nThe pair-wise comparison matrix Am = \(aij 1, 2, 3, ...,m and i = j;\naij = aik/ajk, i, j, k = 1, 2, 3, ...,m and i = j.\nAfter checking the consistence of the matrix, then we\ncalculate the weight by the following function:\nwi =\n1\nm\nm?\nj=1\naij\nm?\nk=1\nakj\n\(1 formula \(2 work, aij\nrepresents the relative importance of two keywords, m is the\nnumber of the keywords in the preference keyword set.\nThe weight vector of a review keyword set can be decided\nby the term frequency/inverse document frequency \(TF-IDF  weights in Information Retrieval. TF, the\nterm frequency \(or normalized frequency keyword set of a review r by user u is de?ned as\nTF =\nNrki\ng?\ni=1\nNrki\n\(2 occurrences of the keyword rki\nin all the keyword sets of the reviews commented by the same\nuser u, g is the number of the keywords in the keyword set\nof the review r. The inverse document frequency \(IDF dividing the number of all reviews by the number\nof reviews containing the keyword.\nIDF = log\n|R|\n|r? : rki r?| \(3 of reviews where\nkeyword rki appears. Then, the TF-IDF weight of the keyword\nrki in the keyword set of review r can be decided by the\nfollowing function:\n849\nFig. 3. An example of a simple domain thesaurus of hotel reservation system\nwrki = TF × IDF =\nNrki\ng?\ni=1\nNrki\n× log |R||r? : rki ? r?| \(4 on the cosine-based approach is\nde?ned as follows:\nsim\(UK,RK UK,RK WRK?2\n=\nn?\ni=1\nWUK,i ×WRK,i?\nn?\ni=1\nW 2UK,i\n?\nn?\ni=1\nW 2RK,i\n\(5 vectors of the prefer-\nence keyword set UK and a review keyword set RK respec-\ntively. WUK,i is the i-th dimension of\n??\nWUK , and WRK,i is\nthe i-th dimension of\n??\nWRK .\n3. Recommendation generation:\nOnce the set of most similar users are found, the personal-\nized rating of each candidate service for the active user can\nbe calculated. Finally, the service\(s s we use a weighted average approach to calculate the\npersonalized rating of a service for the active user.\nrp r¯ + k\n?\nRKj?Rˆ\nsim\(UK,RKj rj ? r 6 UK,RKj UK of the active user and a review keyword\nset RKj ; multiplier k serves as a normalizing factor, k n1?\nRKj?Rˆ sim\(UK,RKj corresponding\nrating of the review RKj , and r¯ is de?ned as the average\nratings of all the reviews of the service.\nRepeating the steps above, we can calculate the personalized\nratings of all candidate services for the active user. Once the\npersonalized rating of each service for the active user are\ncalculated, we can rank the services by the personalized ratings\nand present a personalized ranking list to the active user. Then\nthe service\(s s the best\nK services to the user.\nB. Implementation on Map-Reduce Framework\nTo improve the scalability and ef?ciency of our recom-\nmender system in big data environment, we implement our\nmethod in a Map-Reduce framework on Hadoop platform. The\nwhole computation ?owchart on Map-Reduce is shown in Fig.\n4, which consists of four phases. The ?rst and second phases\nare executed of?ine, and the other two phases are executed\nonline.\nMap-I: Map < i, j, rij , Rij > on j such that the tuple\nwith the same j are shuf?ed to the same node in the form\nof < i, rij , Rij >.\nReduce-I: Take < i, rij , Rij > as the input and\nemit < i, j, rij RKij , r¯j > for each input of Map-I <\ni, j, rij , Rij >? I1. The output of Reduce-I O1 = {<\ni, j, rij , RKij r¯j >}, j ? [1, N ] will be used as the input\nof Map-III to calculate the similarity.\nThe ?rst phase is to process the reviews of candidate\nservices into keyword sets and compute the average ratings\nfor each service I1 = {< i, j, rij , Rij >}, j ? [1, N ] is the\ninput of Map-I, where rij is the rating on service j by past\nuser i, Rij is a review commented on service j by user i, N\n850\nFig. 4. The computation ?owchart of PASR on Map-Reduce\nis the number of candidate services, and RKij in the output\nof Reduce-I is the review keyword set of Rij .\nMap-II: Map < i,Rik > on i such that the reviews of the\nsame user i are shuf?ed to the same node in the form of\n< Rik >.\nReduce-II: Take < Rik > as the input and emit < i,Wi >.\nWik is the weight vector of a 


review keyword set of a past\nuser i. And the tuples < i,Wi > will be used to calculate the\nsimilarity in Reduce-III.\nThe second phase processes the reviews of the past users\ninto keyword sets and takes advantage of the TF-IDF measure-\nment to calculate the weight vectors of the review keyword sets\nof past users. I2 i,Rik >} is the input of Map-II, where\nRik is a review of user i.\nMap-III: Map < i, j, rij , RKij , r¯j > on j, and tuples\nwith the same j are shuf?ed to the same node in form of\n< i, rij , RKij , r¯j >.\nReduce-III Take < WUK >, < i,Wi > and\n< i, rij , RKij , r¯j > as the input, then emit\nSimilarity = {< i, j, rij , sij r¯j >}, j ? [1, N ].\nThe third phase is to compute the similarity between the\nactive user and the past users WUK is the weight vector of\nthe preference keyword set of the active user. sij is denoted\nas the similarity of the preference keyword set of the active\nuser and the keyword set of a review on service j by user i.\nMap-IV Map < i, j, rij , sij , r¯j > on j so that the tuples\nwith the same j are shuf?ed to the same node in form of\n< i, rij , sij , r¯j >.\nReduce-IV: Take < i, rij , sij , r¯j > as the input, and emit\nRanking ? list pj , j >}, j ? [1, N ], where pj is the\npersonalized rating of service j to the active user. The tuples\nof the output are ordered by the services id j, which is just\nthe personalized ranking list of the candidate services to the\nactive user.\nThe last phase aims to calculate the personalized rating\nof each candidate service and present a personalized ranking\nlist to the active user. Based on the output of this phase, the\nrecommendation can be obtained.\nIV. EXPERIMENT\nIn this section, we present the experiments results to show\nthe performance in scalability and accuracy of our approach.\nA. Setup and dataset\n1. Setup:\nOur experiments were performed on a Hadoop distributed\nplatform consist of 18 PC machines noted h0 ? h17, h0 is\nNameNode and JobTracker, h1 ? h17 are DataNodes and\nTaskTracker. The speci?c con?guration of each PC is as\nfollows:\nHardware environment: CPU Intel\(R R 6x4GB Disk: 2TB 3.5-inch 7.2K\nRPM SATA II Hard Drive.\nSoftware environment: Redhat Enterpreise Linux Server 6.0;\nJava 1.6.0; Hadoop-0.20.205.0.\n2. Dataset:\nTo evaluate the accuracy and scalability of our method two\nkinds of dataset are adopted in the experiments. Firstly, a real\ndataset is used to evaluate the accuracy The real dataset is\ndata of a speci?c service domain \(hotel reservation review site \(www.tripadvisor.com available from a variety of sources. We collect\nthe reviews data of the hotels located in Hong Kong and lter\nout the hotels having no reviews. After cleaning, there are\n435666 review records, with 44676 users and 305 hotels. All\nthe ratings rated for the hotels range from 1 to 5, with 5 as\nthe excellent. In our experiments, the entire real dataset was\nsplit into 80% train data and 20% test data.\nFurthermore, to evaluate the scalability and ef?ciency of\nour approach in big data environment, a synthetic dataset is\ngenerated randomly, which is much larger than the real dataset.\nB. Performance evaluation\n1. Accuracy evaluation\nMean Absolute Error \(MAE quality\n851\n[23]. It is de?ned as the average absolute deviation between a\npredicted rating and the user’s real rating.\nMAE =\nM?\ni=1\n|pi ? qi|\nM\n\(7 user i respectively. And M is the number of the pairs of\nthe predicted ratings and the real ratings < pi, qi We also\nuse the Normalized Mean Absolute Error \(NMAE de?ned as:\nNMAE =\nMAE\nM?\ni=1\nqi/M\n\(8 this work, we compare our method with other\ntwo well-known recommendation methods: user-based algo-\nrithm using Pearson Correlation Coef?cient \(PCC and\nIPCC respectively [9]. From Table IV, it could be found that\nour method provide a more accurate prediction than other two\napproaches.\nTABLE IV\nMAES AND NMAES OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES\nRecommendation\nmethod\nPASR UPCC IPCC\nMAE 0.5939 0.7758 0.7107\nNMAE 0.2135 0.2502 0.2471\n2. Scalability evaluation\nWe adopt a well-accepted scalability metric, Speedup [24],\nto measure the performance in the scalability of our method.\nSpeedup refers to how much a parallel algorithm is faster than\na corresponding sequential algorithm, which can be de?ned as\nfollows:\nSp =\nT1\nTp\n\(9 parallel execution time with p\nprocessors. If the speedup has a linear relation with the\nnumbers of nodes with the datasize ?xed, the algorithm will\nhave good scalability.\nFrom Fig. 5, we can see that the speedup of our method\nincreased relative linearly with the growth of the number of\nnodes in big data environment. We also can nd that larger\ndataset size obtained a better speedup. These show that our\nmethod on Map-Reduce has good scalability over big data\nand better with larger dataset.\nOverall, the experiment results show that our method on\nMap-Reduce framework performs well both in accuracy and\nscalability.\nFig. 5. Speedup of PASR\nV. RELATED WORKS\nThere have been many recommender systems developed\nin both academia and industry. Grundy system is the rst\nrecommender system, which builds models of users based\non a limited amount of information on each individual user\nby using stereotypes as a mechanism [25]. Adomavicius and\nTuzhilin give an overview of the 


eld of recommender sys-\ntems and describe the current generation of recommendation\nmethods in [9]. They also describe various limitations of\ncurrent service recommendation methods, and discuss possible\nextensions that can improve recommendation capabilities and\nmake recommender systems applicable to an even broader\nrange of applications.\nMost existing service recommender systems are only based\non a single numerical rating to represent a service’s utility\nas a whole [26]. In fact, evaluating a service through mul-\ntiple criteria and taking into account of user feedback can\nhelp to make more effective recommendations for the users.\n[27 presents a multi-criteria service recommendation method\nwhich is based on the idea of clustering users in preference\nlattices” according to their criteria preferences. They present\nthree different methods for predictions to instantiate the overall\nclustering approach. In [28], Dietmar Jannach et al. use\nSupport Vector regression to determine the relative impor-\ntance of the individual criteria ratings and suggest combining\nuser-based and item-based regression models in a weighted\napproach. They aim at leveraging information derived from\nmulti-dimensional ratings to improve the predictive accuracy\nof multi-criteria recommender systems.\nWith the development of cloud computing software tools\nsuch as Apache Hadoop, Map-Reduce and Mahout, it be-\ncomes possible to design and implement scalable recom-\nmender systems in big data environment. The authors of\n[29] implement a CF algorithm on Hadoop. They solve the\nscalability problem by dividing dataset. But their method\ndoesn’t have favorable scalability and ef?ciency if the da-\n852\nta grows 30] presents a parallel user pro?ling approach\nbased on folksonomy information and implements a scalable\nrecommender system by using Map-Reduce and Cascading\ntechniques. In [31], Y. Jin et al. propose a large-scale video\nrecommendation system based on an item-based CF algorithm.\nThey implement their proposed approach in Qizmt, which is a\n.Net Map-Reduce framework, thus their system can work for\nlarge-scale video sites.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we propose a preference-aware service recom-\nmendation method on Map-Reduce, named PASR. In PASR,\nkeywords are used to indicate users’ preferences, and a user-\nbased Collaborative Filtering algorithm is adopted to generate\nappropriate recommendations. More speci?cally, a keyword-\ncandidate list and domain thesaurus are provided to help obtain\nusers’ preferences. The active user gives his/her preferences by\nselecting the keywords from the keyword-candidate list, and\nthe preferences of the past users can be extracted from their\nreviews according to the keyword-candidate list and domain\nthesaurus. Our method aims at presenting a personalized rank-\ning list and recommending the most appropriate service\(s data environment, we implement it in a\nMap-Reduce framework on Hadoop platform. The experiment\nresults show that our method, PASR, performs well both in\nthe accuracy and scalability. In our future work, we will\ndo further research in how to distinguish the positive and\nnegative preferences of the users from their reviews to make\nthe predictions more accurate.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis paper is partly supported by the National Science Foun-\ndation of China under Grant No. 61021062 and 61073032, and\nJiangsu Provincial NSF Project under Grant BE2011171, and\nNational Key Technology R&D Program of the Ministry of\nScience and Technology under Grant 2011BAK21B06.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.

datasets are \nproduced by two or more Map Functions, joining among \ndifferent datasets is widely applied in ConMR. There are a \nnumber of research papers to address the problem of joins \nusing MR related solutions Broadcast join is proposed in \n[18] for one dataset is relatively small. This dataset can be \ncopied to each computing machine for conducting join \noperations at local file systems. Different join algorithms are ncompared in [19]. One-phase-join mentioned in [20] uses a \nfiltering-join-aggregation model to deal with Map-Join-\nReduce. Research papers [21][22] optimize multiple joins \nusing Lagrange relaxation method. In [23 the authors \npropose matrix-based method to balance the input and \noutput dataset size for different Reduce Tasks. In [24], \nHilbert Space Filling Curve is proposed to deal with multi-\nway theta-join problem. \nRestore 25] has been used to keep intermediate results \nfor future workflow use. Unlike this method, our data reuse nis share-aware and corresponding optimization is offered. \nVI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper, we propose ConMR, a concurrent MR \nprogramming model. ConMR addresses the need to define \nmultiple independent MR sub-jobs to provide a solution to a \ncomplex problem. Besides this, ConMR reduces the amount \nof work by taking into account data sharing at the job  and \nfunction levels. To summarizes the main contributions.  \n\(1 We propose a concurrent MR framework ConMR \nwith multiple heterogeneous map and Reduce Functions. \nThe shared data of different map and Reduce Functions are \ndefined by programmers to guarantee the data sharing is nimplemented in an efficient manner. \n\(2 levels. For job-level data sharing, the \nframework manages the data by replicating data to ensure \ndata locality. For function-level data sharing, it provides \noptimization by supplying the shared data to multiple Map \nTasks from different Map Functions. It also merges the \noutput of the same Map Functions on the shared data. \n\(3 nMatching. Results have demonstrated up to 4X performance \nspeedup compared to traditional non-concurrent MR n \n \n678\n  \nFuture work will focus on the following three directions. \n\(1 Handler to process \ndifferent Map Functions, we can optimize it further by \nmerging the outputs of the intermediate key-value pairs. For \nexample, we can merge the outputs of MF11 and MF13 in \nFig. 2\(a intermediate key-value pairs can be like \n<EI00, PS, 12000, 96> et al.  \n\(2 method using a large \ncluster size on both a public cloud and a private cloud. \nCurrently we are using up to eight instances on Amazon \nEC2. The advantage of the programming model will be \nfurther amplified given a larger cluster size. \n\(3 programming model \nwith built-in support for job- and function-level optimization. \nAcknowledgments: This publication was made possible by \nNPRP grant # 09-1116-1-172 from the Qatar National \nResearch Fund \(a member of Qatar Foundation acknowledge Amazon for providing \nresearch grant for using Amazon web services. \nVII.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
