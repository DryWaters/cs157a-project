The idea of transition learning is to apply balanced\nensemble learning for a certain time, and then to switch to\nnegative correlation learning. The short learning period with the\nsudden changes of learning behaviors is called transition learning.\nExperimental studies had been conducted to examine the learning\nbehaviors in the transition process. It was found that the training\nerror rates had big sudden changes in the beginning of transition\nprocess. The changes in the training error rates became smaller\nand smaller at the end of transition process. The more interesting\nresults are how such sudden change on the training set would lead\nto the testing set. By observing the performance on the testing\nerror rates, it was found that transition learning were able to\nprevent the learning from over?tting.\nIndex Terms—Neural network learning, balanced ensemble\nlearning, negative correlation learning.\nI INTRODUCTION\nOver?tting has often been observed in single neural network\nlearning when there are a limit number of training data points.\nWhen over?tting happens, the learned neural network could\nperform extremely well on the training data, but poorly on the\ntesting data. Therefore, some strategies such as early stopping\nand weight decay have been developed to prevent from over-\n?tting. Such over?tting could appear in the ensemble neural\nnetwork learning as well although it has been expected that\nover?tting might not be so severe in the learned neural network\nensembles. Early stopping can certainly also be used in the\nensemble neural network learning. However, early stopping\nrequire to use a certain number of data points as the validation\nset that cannot be used in learning. It would mean that the\nfewer data points can be used in training after adopting early\nstopping. For those applications that only few learning data\npoints are available, there might not be enough data points for\ntraining if too many data points would be used as validation\nset. Meanwhile, if there would be too small number of data\npoints in the validation set, learning could be stopped too\nearly because it might only take very short time to reach a\ngood performance on a small validation set. Therefore, early\nstopping is often not a good choice for an application with few\ndata points.\nBalanced ensemble learning [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] was\ndeveloped from negative correlation learning 6] by shifting\nthe learning targets. The idea of balanced ensemble learning\nis to weaken the error signals on the learned data points\nin order to enforce the learning to turn to those not-yet-\nlearned data points. By comparing balanced ensemble learning\nand negative correlation learning for two structures of neural\nnetwork ensembles on both low noisy data and high noisy data,\nit was found that balanced ensemble learning could achieve\nmuch lower error rates than negative correlation learning on\nsome hard training sets [3], [4], [5]. It was also found that\nbalanced ensemble learning could even make an ensemble\nwith small neural networks to reach a similar level of er-\nror rates of an ensemble with large neural networks trained\nby negative correlation learning. However, over?tting might\nhappen in balanced ensemble learning for the ensembles with\nlarge neural networks. Therefore, some measures such as extra\nrandom learning had been taken in balanced ensemble learning\nto prevent the ensembles with large neural networks from\nover?tting [7], [8].\nWhile balanced ensemble learning could learn faster with\nthe higher risk of over?tting, negative correlation learning\nis more robust in generalization. What would happen in\nthe process if the learning would transition from balanced\nensemble learning to negative correlation learning? In this\npaper, transition learning by negative correlation learning was\nintroduced to balanced ensemble learning. The idea of tran-\nsition learning is to apply balanced ensemble learning for\na certain time, and then to switch to negative correlation\nlearning. Experimental studies had been conducted to examine\nthe learning behaviors in the transition process. It was found\nthat the training error rates had big sudden changes in the\nbeginning of transition process. The changes in the training\nerror rates became smaller and smaller at the end of transition\nprocess. The more interesting results are how such sudden\nchange on the training set would lead to the testing set.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II\ndescribes the transition learning between balanced ensemble\nlearning and negative correlation learning. Section III examines\nthe learning behaviors in the process of transition process.\nFinally, Section IV concludes with a summary of the paper.\nII. TRANSITION LEARNING AFTER BALANCED ENSEMBLE\nLEARNING\nA balanced ensemble learning [1] was developed by chang-\ning error functions in negative correlation learning [6]. In\nnegative correlation learning, the output ? of a neural network\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics\n978-1-4799-0652-9/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI n2647\n10.1109/SMC.2013.452\nensemble is formed by a simple averaging of outputs ?? of\na set of neural networks Given the training data set ? =\n{\(x\(1 1 x  


ensemble are trained on the same training data set ?\n  1  individual network ? on the ?th\ntraining pattern x  the ?th training pattern, and ? is the number of\nindividual networks in the neural network ensemble.\nThe idea of negative correlation learning [6] is to introduce\na correlation penalty term into the error function of each\nindividual network so that all the individual networks can be\ntrained simultaneously and interactively The error function\n?? for individual ? on the training data set ? in negative\ncorrelation learning is de?ned by\n?? =\n1\n?\n???=1  2 patterns and 2 the\nmean-squared error of individual network ?. The second term\nis a correlation penalty function. The purpose of minimizing\nis to negatively correlate each individual’s error with errors for\nthe rest of the ensemble. The parameter ? is used to adjust the\nstrength of the penalty.\nThe partial derivative of ?? with respect to the output of\nindividual ? on the ?th training pattern is\n      1      3   to the target output 0,\nthere is no correlation penalty function, and each individual\nnetwork is just trained independently based on\n    4     5     For the classi?cation problems,\nit is unnecessary to have the smallest difference between  an example of a two-class problem, the target\nvalue ? on a data point can be set up to 1.0 or 0.0 depend on\nwhich class the data point belongs to. As long as ? is larger\nthan 0.5 at ? = 1.0 or smaller than 0.5 at 1.0, the data\npoint will be correctly classi?ed.\nIn balanced ensemble learning [1], the error function for\neach individual on each data point is de?ned based on whether\nthe ensemble has learned the data point or not. If the ensemble\nhad learned to classify the data point correctly, a shifting\nparameter ? with values of 0 0.5 could be introduced\ninto the derivative of error function in Eq.\(refrelation each\nindividual\n    6 1\nwould be added to the the derivative of error function for each\nindividual\n    7 data too well to\nprevent from learning hard data points too slowly.\nIn this paper, the learning was divided into two processes.\nBalanced ensemble learning was applied in the ?rst learning\nprocess, while negative correlation learning took the place in\nthe second learning process. It was to discover how the learning\nbehaviors would change in the transition period. It was also to\nsee whether such transition learning could help in preventing\nfrom over?tting and improving the generalization.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe following two data sets were obtained from the UCI\nmachine learning bench-mark repository. They were available\nby anonymous ftp at ics.uci.edu \(128.195.1.1 diabetes data set is a two-class problem which has 500\nexamples of class 1 and 268 of class 2. There are 8 attributes\nfor each example. The data set is rather dif?cult to classify. The\nso-called “class” value is really a binarised form of another\nattribute which is itself highly indicative of certain types of\ndiabetes but does not have a one to one correspondence with\nthe medical condition of being diabetic.\nThe Australian credit card assessment data set is to assess\napplications for credit cards based on a number of attributes.\nThere are 690 cases in total. The output has two classes. The\n14 attributes include 6 numeric values and 8 discrete ones, the\nlatter having from 2 to 14 possible values.\nn-fold cross-validation were used in which n is set to 12 for\nthe diabetes data, and 10 for the card data. 5 runs of ?-fold\ncross-validation had been conducted to calculate the average\nresults, in which total 60 runs and 50 runs have been carried\nout for the diabetes data and the card data respectively. The\nensemble architecture used in the experiments has 10 neural\nnetworks. Each individual neural network is a feedforward\nneural network with one hidden layer and 10 hidden nodes.\nBalanced ensemble learning with ? = 0.25 and ? = 0.25 was\napplied in the ?rst 2000 training epochs respectively, while the\ntraining was switched to the negative correlation learning in\nthe second 2000 training epochs in each run.\n2648\nA. Results of Transition Learning at Ensemble Level\nTables I and II presented the changes of average error\nrates of the learned ensembles by balanced ensemble learning\nwith 0.25 and ? = 0.4 to negative correlation learning.\nThe comparison results between balanced ensemble learning\nand negative correlation learning had been discussed in the\npast results. Generally speaking balanced ensemble learning\nis able to learn hard data points faster and better than negative\ncorrelation learning. However, such power of learning could\nalso lead balanced ensemble learning to over?tting 


severely.\nTABLE I\nCHANGES OF AVERAGE ERROR RATES OF THE LEARNED ENSEMBLES BY\nBALANCED ENSEMBLE LEARNING WITH 0.25 TO NEGATIVE\nCORRELATION LEARNING.\nNo. of epochs Diabetes Card\nTrain Test Train Test\n50 0.223 0.240 0.112 0.139\n2000 0.060 0.261 0.007 0.157\n2001 0.117 0.251 0.049 0.142\n2050 0.124 0.242 0.033 0.138\n4000 0.078 0.239 0.010 0.146\nTABLE II\nCHANGES OF AVERAGE ERROR RATES OF THE LEARNED ENSEMBLES BY\nBALANCED ENSEMBLE LEARNING WITH ? = 0.4 TO NEGATIVE\nCORRELATION LEARNING.\nNo. of epochs Diabetes Card\nTrain Test Train Test\n50 0.231 0.240 0.124 0.138\n2000 0.091 0.281 0.010 0.169\n2001 0.211 0.273 0.105 0.135\n2050 0.184 0.241 0.076 0.138\n4000 0.088 0.241 0.013 0.141\nIn Table I, negative correlation learning reached 6% of\nthe training error rate after 2000 training epochs on the\ndiabetes data while balanced ensemble learning was just able\nto have 7.8% by continuing another 2000 training epochs.\nSuch differences of the training error rates between negative\ncorrelation learning and balanced ensemble learning were also\nfound on the card data. By observing the testing error rates,\nnegative correlation learning fell to over?tting on both data\nsets.\nThe surprised results did not come from comparing the\nend results between balanced ensemble learning and negative\ncorrelation learning. After having the lower training error rate\nby 2000 training epochs of balanced ensemble learning, the\ntraining error rates turned much higher just by switching\nto negative correlation learning for one training epoch. For\nexample, the training error rates became twice worse from 6%\nto 11.7% on the diabetes, and seven times worse from 0.7% to\n4.9% on the card data set. Meanwhile, the testing error rates\nbecame better in such a short transition on both data sets.\nThe training error rates changed slowly in the ?rst 50\ntraining epochs after switching. On the testing error rates,\nthe over?tting was corrected back Transition learning with\n? = 0.4 in Table II showed the similar trends to those of\ntransition learning with 0.2. Even larger changes were\nseen in the early stage of transition learning with ? = 0.4.\nB. Results of Transition Learning at Individual Level\nTables III and IV presented the changes of average error\nrates of the individual neural networks in the learned ensembles\nby balanced ensemble learning with ? = 0.25 and ? = 0.4\nto negative correlation learning. Obviously balanced ensemble\nlearning were able to create weaker learners with the higher\nerror rates than negative correlation learning. However, too\nweak learners could lead to over?tting on the three tested\ndata sets. By adopting transition learning, the weaker learners\ncould become a little stronger. Meanwhile, the over?tting was\ncorrected back. By continuing transition learning, individual\nneural networks had becomed so strong that they turned to\nbe similar. It is not so useful to combine the similar neural\nnetworks into an ensemble. Therefore, only short transition\nlearning should be conducted to make the individual learners\nneither too weak or too strong.\nTABLE III\nCHANGES OF AVERAGE ERROR RATES OF THE LEARNED INDIVIDUAL\nNEURAL NETWORKS IN TRANSITION LEARNING WITH ? = 0.25.\nNo. of epochs Diabetes Card\nTrain Test Train Test\n50 0.394 0.402 0.306 0.318\n2000 0.318 0.402 0.243 0.338\n2001 0.311 0.375 0.207 0.266\n2050 0.256 0.328 0.106 0.194\n4000 0.177 0.304 0.041 0.194\nTABLE IV\nCHANGES OF AVERAGE ERROR RATES OF THE LEARNED INDIVIDUAL\nNEURAL NETWORKS IN TRANSITION LEARNING WITH ? = 0.4.\nNo. of epochs Diabetes Card\nTrain Test Train Test\n50 0.449 0.450 0.421 0.424\n2000 0.425 0.460 0.398 0.432\n2001 0.371 0.395 0.229 0.248\n2050 0.268 0.305 0.124 0.176\n4000 0.171 0.298 0.043 0.190\nTables V and VI presented the changes of average cover\nrates of the individual neural networks in the learned ensembles\nby balanced ensemble learning with ? = 0.25 and ? = 0.4\nto negative correlation learning. The cover rate between two\nindividual neural networks is the rate of outputting the same\nclass for the same data points. If the cover rate between the two\nindividual neural networks would equal to 1, it would mean\nthat the two neural networks would output the same class for\nevery data points. The smaller the cover rates are, the more\ndifferent the two neural networks are. The individual neural\nnetworks by balanced ensemble learning were so different that\nthe average cover rates had fallen below 0.5 on ? = 0.4,\nand been just above 0.5 on ? = 0.25. The cover rates\nquickly rose in transition learning. In the past research, it had\n2649\nbeen suggested that the more different the individual neural\nnetworks in an ensemble would be, the better performance\nthe ensemble might have. The experiment results showed that\nsuch conclusions might not be able to be applied to balanced\nensemble learning. The individual neural networks by balanced\nensemble learning might be too different while the individual\nneural networks by negative correlation learning might be\ntoo similar. With transition learning, the individual neural\nnetworks could be just different enough to achieve the better\nperformance.\nTABLE V\nCHANGES OF AVERAGE COVER RATES OF THE LEARNED INDIVIDUAL\nNEURAL NETWORKS IN TRANSITION LEARNING WITH ? = 0.25.\nNo. of epochs Diabetes Card\nTrain Test Train Test\n50 0.524 0.524 0.572 0.572\n2000 0.542 0.528 0.599 0.566\n2001 0.573 0.564 0.681 0.663\n2050 0.657 0.643 0.837 0.799\n4000 0.746 0.696 0.934 0.817\nTABLE VI\nCHANGES OF AVERAGE COVER RATES OF THE LEARNED INDIVIDUAL\nNEURAL NETWORKS IN TRANSITION LEARNING WITH ? = 0.4.\nNo. of epochs Diabetes Card\nTrain Test Train Test\n50 0.472 0.473 0.473 0.473\n2000 0.473 0.473 0.474 0.473\n2001 0.547 0.543 0.698 0.696\n2050 0.691 0.685 0.849 0.837\n4000 0.763 0.714 0.933 0.820\nTables VII and VIII presented the changes of correlations\nof the output by the individual neural

Other interactions are possible e.g. the source service \nadds its sensor class and instance to a store service \(at a period \nmatching the sensor reading update and not \nrequire additional transmission to the original source node. \nV. IMPLEMENTATION \nA. HPP Implementation \nThis section discusses the design and implementation issues \nencountered in an initial implementation using the CIM \ninformation model for sensor objects and storing this data in \nHBase. The implementation in ‘C’ includes the Data Model \nService, Object Space and Local Instrumentation Layers \nshown in Figure 1 and a DM_SINK_SRV service written in \nJava to integrate with HBase. The ‘C’ code was implemented ninitially on Linux, using the hpp_service abstraction on top of \nthe hpp channel abstraction to hide the specific network layer \ndetails. Testing was done using Linux based source nodes \nsending hpp messages to transfer their classes and instances to \na specified number of remote nodes using a small number of nfunctions, as the following code is all that is required for a \nservice to start receiving messages from other services: \n \n    rv = hpp_endpoint_check\(endpoint_ptr rv == 0 hpp_endpoint_accept\(endpoint_ptr rv > 0 endpoint_ptr timed out with no data, so loop again \n \nThe Linux code was then ported to Contiki running on a \nSky WSN mote emulated in Cooja the object space at different times as the node \nstarted up \(and added dynamically later nclass and instance objects were created at the start of the \nprocess, followed by the node class and instance and the local \ninstrumented objects for led and temperature sensor. This \nshowed the architecture and its abstractions worked across \nLinux and constrained nodes. \nB. Data Model Service Layer \nThe initial Contiki implementation includes a number of \ncustom CoAP "resources" on top of the data model layer, using \nthe object space. For example, a DM_SOURCE_SRV service \nand node objects were implemented as key value pair objects \nbe sent to another node such as a DM_STORE_SRV. Also, a \nCoAP resource was implemented for the creation of HPP nobjects dynamically. Classes and instances for red/blue/green \nleds, temperature sensor and node, using a subset of attributes \nfrom the CIM object, were also implemented. The following \npseudo-code \(not including error code s dm_register_dm_service\(objectAttr_t *template_ptr, \nobjectAttr_t *inst_ptr, objectAttr_t *inst_key_ptr if \(dm_srv_class_hdl == 0 n DMServiceTemplate,    \n                         DM_SERVICE_CLASSNAME  if \(service_role || DM_SOURCE_SRV  li objectswith object store  \n  if \(service_role || DM_SINK_SRV  objects we are interested in to \n  }         // object space on remote peers \n  if \(service_role DM_STORE_SRV  from peers \n  return \(0 dm_initialise    classes/instances. Retrieving object instances is done by \ndm_get_instance\(inst_handle  which \nuses key values or particular attribute values according to the \nmatching specified. Matching is implemented in the data model \nlayer and not the object library \(the contents of objects are \ntransparent to it nsetupTemplate  dm_add_instance instrumented data is implemented using an \nli_class_property for each property and an li_inst_property \nwith the value. This per property approach aligns with the \nhardware/vendor specific implementations to access particular \nreadings or data,  e.g. to access sensor data by reading a value \nfrom a register or an API call like get_sensor_reading is to be put in \(it could appear in more than \none ninformation models or be added into tables or key value stores \nsuch as HBase.

nmessage building parts of the hpp protocol have been ported to \nContiki as part of the pre-existing erbium-REST \nimplementation example [9]. This approach allowed these \nitems to be tested on hardware with a supporting REST \ninfrastructure and for the port to use existing Contiki libraries. \nThe code samples below show the integration itself was \nstraightforward. The hpp message payload was simply added as \nCoAP payload using the call REST.set_response_payload nthe existing Contiki networking stack will not be difficult. The \nadditional code required in Contiki compared to Linux \nconsisted of: \n• A Contiki call to initialize hpp_element. The simple call \nservice_hdl service_initialise nhpp_service daemon to set up the service and node objects. \n• Integrating with the REST code. This consisted of code to \nadd the resource into the erbium resource handling list \nrest_activate_resource\(&resource_hppnode and the code \nto implement that resource. The CoAP resources were \naccessed via URLs using a suffix of hpp/[classname] and \nthe node responded with the properties implemented in \nthat hpp object as key value pairs in the CoAP payload, \nusing multiple CoAP buffers. A RESOURCE macro is \nused to define a CoAP resource and the CoAP verbs such \nas get or put it handles, with a corresponding function to \nimplement it called resource-name_handler. The handler \nbelow for the node object returns the node instance from \nthe object space when queried over CoAP: \n \nvoid hppnode_handler dm_find_instance\(NODE_CLASS instObj_ptr, response, buffer Resource for Hpp Objects. This allowed a URI \nlike /nodeAddr/hpp/object?hdl=x to select an object by \nthe handle allocated when it was created in the object \nspace or to walk through the available objects, as shown nby the following handler: \n \nvoid hppobject_handler request, "hdl chdl hdl instObj_ptr, response buffer wrapping the Contiki \nled calls  and is called by a resource handler to set a led: \n  \nli_mote_method\(int method_cap, int inst_id, int setting uint8_t method_cap == MOTE_CAP_LED_SET n    if \(setting == MOTE_LED_ON led Integration of Data From  Contiki Based Node with HBase \nWe created a HBase table for each hpp class with a row for \neach instance. The tables have two column families named \n"key attributes" and "attributes" and a column family qualifier \nfor each attribute.

It is planned to nperform more objective tests in defined scenarios. \n1 ensuring that “end-\nuser” and “WSN geek” are catered for [6]. The “end-user” is a \ndomain expert concerned with using the WSN data and not \nwith the network/node specifics, which  the “WSN geek” is \nconcerned with. We have shown examples where the end user \nis able to access the data simply with known CoAP Resources \nor objects or from the HBase store. The “WSN geek” has been \nprovided with a cross-platform architecture using an object \n551\nspace and data model layer with a local instrumentation layer \nfor incorporating node specific functionality and capabilities. \nThe code extracts show that these items made it straightforward \nfor a node to implement objects from a rich information model \non both a Linux and Contiki platform and to map to CoAP nResources. This also meets the design goal of the same \nabstractions giving a generic information infrastructure across \nheterogeneous platforms of different capability, even when \nused with delivery protocols other than the hpp protocol. The \nobject space was also shown to easily map objects to specific nCoAP REST resources and the hppobj resource above showed \nit also easily supported discovery and searches 


across the \nimplemented objects.  \nThe value of some of the service abstractions has been \nshown with a Java DM_SINK_SRV service that receives data \nas hpp key value pairs  from Contiki and stores that data in \nHBase and also a DM_SOURCE_SRV that adds its classes and \ninstances to specific remote nodes \(via hpp add directly or in a \nCoAP PUT payload based \nimplementation of the objects fits naturally with the low level \nspecifics of the nodes and maps to CoAP REST resources, such \nas led and sensors and groupings of individual attributes, such \nas proposed in the IP for Smart Objects \(IPSO  having a class object as a template with attribute \ndescriptions and its instance object with attribute values was \nsuccessful in three ways; it allowed selective use of attributes \nfrom CIM classes on constrained nodes important for the \nmany strings used in objects such as CIM_NumericSensor abstractions in a COAP/REST environment \nand also allowed straightforward mapping of these attributes \ninto a HBase store. \n3 and the use of a property per attribute mapped \nwell to HBase columns. Furthermore, the approach of separate nkey and non-key properties could be mapped to separate HBase \ncolumn families, allowing a HBase scan across all rows of key \nattributes as well as non-key attributes, rather than only being \nable to use the key attributes as instance identifiers. The hpp \nmessage primitives also mapped well to HBase functionality, \ne.g the two column families defined for attributes allowed \nadding new objects with their attributes by creating a table \(and \nits columns class. Similarly, a hpp Add \nof an instance \(at a given time The architecture allowed hpp data on the node to \nbe transported and stored in HBase, using CoAP, requiring no napplication level proxy and only requiring a proxy at the \nnetwork level \(the rpl border gateway Implementation and Code Porting Issues \nThe approach of initially implementing on Linux allowed \nthe design to be refined and the code to be debugged and tested \nmore easily and rapidly, using the more advanced Linux ndevelopment and debug environments. It also provided services \non Linux that could integrate easily with those on constrained \nnodes. These benefits came at little cost in terms of the \nsubsequent port to Contiki as most of the code did not require \nany changes, given the availability of standard C libraries in \nContiki. The main code changes were to provide a revised \nMakefile, a simplified implementation of gettimeofday object leases and to change the type of function parameters \nand structure members to reduce size \(e.g. from int to char the hpp code. Retaining parts of the erbium \nand CoAP stack did allow using the CoAP transport and the \nCopper Browser plugin for testing. A more complete \nintegration with CoAP would reduce the memory footprint and nallow more hpp functionality to be included. \nTABLE I.

The REST engine and CoAP use a \nsmall amount of memory compared to networking, which is \nequivalent to that for the platform and core It can be seen that \nthe code and data usage of hpp is equivalent to that of CoAP, \nso that it is feasible for a constrained device. \nVII. CONCLUSION \nWe have proposed a set of requirements for an architecture \nthat reflects the characteristics of WSNs and would allow \nWSNs to be more widely deployed and more easily integrated \nwith applications, including Big Data services to collect and \nanalyse their data. We have proposed a holistic architecture \nwith defined abstractions, software layers, a loosely coupled \nobject space and a simple and flexible protocol. These \nabstractions also enabled the approach of developing the code ninitially on Linux and then porting to Contiki. We have also \nevaluated the architecture based on an initial implementation. \nThe first requirement has been met by showing that the \narchitecture and abstractions can be relatively easily \nimplemented on both constrained WSN nodes with acceptable \n552\nmemory use and are also suitable for more capable devices and \napplications, e.g. on Linux. The second requirement has been \nmet by providing abstractions for the basic operations of a \nsensor node and the services using it, e.g. the local ninstrumentation layer handled the underlying Contiki hardware \nlibraries and the data model layer handled the REST resources. \nThe third requirement has been met with the service roles, \nalthough only the source, sink and store roles have been \nimplemented at this point. The fourth requirement has been met \nby showing the exchange of sensor information from the node \nto CoAP to HBase independent of the underlying technology 


nFurther work is planned to port the hpp channel abstraction \nto Contiki and to investigate further integration of hpp with the \nCoAP transport, to implement the other service roles in the \narchitecture, as well as investigating the use of service \ncapabilities/interests, particularly in terms of the interaction nwith Big Data services in the cloud to perform processing. It is \nalso planned to investigate support for P2P overlays and the use \nof Distributed Hash Tables \(DHT more nodes to verify the \narchitecture meets the fifth requirement of being able to scale \nfrom small static networks to larger dynamic, heterogeneous \nenvironments and to show the benefits of the characteristics of nthe P2P and tuple concepts in the architecture \(high scalability, \nredundancy, fault-tolerance and self-management constrained and powerful \nplatforms and enable a straightforward integration with Contiki \nand HBase to store sensor data, requiring only simple message \nreformats without requiring semantic changes or application nproxies in an infrastructure of nodes and services. \nREFERENCES \n[1] N.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
