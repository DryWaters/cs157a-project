INTRODUCTION \nManual data entry and data collection became problematic \nduring the early stages of part identification largely due to \nhuman error. Technological advancements in the 1960s and \n1970s allowed for the achievement of better product coding \nthat improved the accuracy and speed of data processing. \nOne of the earliest forms of product coding is barcode \ntechnology. Barcodes simplified inventory tracking and nmanagement and greatly improved checkout speeds in retail, \nwholesale, and grocery industries. Realizing the efficiency \nthat barcodes brought to commercial applications, the \nUnited States Department of Defense \(DoD mandated \nbarcodes for all DoD material in 1981 [1].  \nHowever, traditional barcode technology \(i.e one-\ndimensional barcodes time [1]. \nBarcodes had short-range readability, and many did not \npossess automated tracking [2]. Traditional barcodes also \npresented both poor data security and limited storage \ncapacity for characters. In some situations, restrictions \nrelated to printing on paper or plastic impeded the \napplication of barcodes on labels [3]. Since traditional \nbarcodes were typically printed on labels, this limited the \nuse of barcodes to certain applications and environments.  \nTwo-dimensional \(2D information in a small space. They differ from \nthe one-dimensional \(1D nin both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Thus, 2D \nbarcodes are capable of storing over 100 times more data \nthan typical 1D barcodes [4]. Examples of 2D barcode \nsymbologies include the QR code, EZ code, and Data nMatrix code. The Data Matrix symbol is the most popular of \nthe 2D barcode symbols. The symbol has been adopted by \nthe automotive, electronics, pharmaceutical, and aviation \nindustries.  \nDirect part marking \(DPM is an ideal method for applying \n2D barcodes to aerospace parts. DPM creates permanency \nof marks and ensures traceability of a part throughout its \nentire lifecycle. DPM techniques are preferable when the \nproduct is separated from its external packaging and \ntraceability is required. They are also preferable when a part \nis too small to be marked with barcode labels or tags. Parts \nthat are subjected to environmental conditions that hamper \nthe durability of add-on identification markings are also \ngood candidates for DPM. Furthermore, DPM is the \nsuggested method when part identification is required \nbeyond the expended life of the part [5]. \nThe biggest challenge in a DPM application is to \nconsistently produce good quality markings for parts \nrequiring machine-readable information [6]. Another \nchallenge is ensuring the act of marking does not inhibit the nfunctionality of the actual part. Incorrect or improper \napplication of part marking techniques can lead to damaging \na part beyond the level of acceptability. Hence, this paper \n  2 \nwill address several concerns of 


DPM. It will analyze the \nflexibility, efficiency, marking quality, and limitations of \ndifferent DPM techniques. The primary objective of this \nresearch is to evaluate the pros and cons of different DPM nprocesses and determine the feasibility of implementing \nspecific DPM procedures into future programs for the nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration \(NASA Office \(GAO  programs were NASA systems. \nAccording to the GAO report, the Aerospace Corporation \nconducted a study and found that “both prime contractors \nand the government space market lost traceability into parts \nas suppliers moved from having to meet military \nspecifications and standards to an environment where the \nprime contractor would ensure that the process used by the \nsupplier would yield a quality part” [7].  Parts quality \nproblems contributed to significant cost overruns, schedule \ndelays, and reduced system reliability. These findings nindicate an immediate need for a system that can enhance \noperability/supportability and reduce life cycle costs.  \nThe Data Matrix ECC 200 symbol is a two-dimensional, \nmachine-readable symbol that can mitigate these problems \nby enhancing traceability of thousands of parts commonly \ninvolved within a single supply chain. The 2D barcode can \nalso be applied to non-paper substrates. An optimal way to \nensure that part markings survive the harsh conditions of \nspace is through DPM techniques.  \nThe Data Matrix symbol is a 2D array of square or round \ncells arranged in contiguous rows and columns that can \nstore information, identify individual components of a larger \nitem, or track items between a sender and recipient [8]-[9]. \nThe standard Data Matrix ECC 200 symbol is highly \nrecommended because of its high accuracy in situations \nwhere the code might even be partially damaged or suffers \nfrom poor resolution. It is a highly secure marking, and \nthus, may not be easily counterfeited. The Data Matrix \nsymbol is also used by industries across the world. As a \nresult, it is compatible with nearly all extant part marking \ntechniques [10]. \nToday, it is common for manufacturers to use human \nreadable designations on parts that have the substrate space \nfor part marking. Yet, there are some parts that lack \nsubstrate space for marking; instead they rely on marked \npackaging for identification However, once the part is \nremoved from the packaging, the traceability of the part is \nlost. This results in scrapping parts since there is no \nverifiable link to a database for tracking the part [8]. Direct \npart marking of Data Matrix symbols eliminates this \nproblem, as it provides tracking of parts that have ninsufficient substrate space. This is one of the chief \nadvantages of the Data Matrix symbol: the symbol can be \ngenerated and placed on micro-size spaces while \nmaintaining readability even at low contrast ratios. For nexample, Data Matrix readers can decode a 50-character \ncode that is only two or three millimeters wide Etched Data \nMatrix codes might be as small as 300 micrometers [9]. \nDirect part marking is the optimal marking method for \nproviding the fidelity needed to apply micro-size, high-\ndensity, machine-readable marks such as the Data Matrix \nsymbol. \n3. CRITERIA FOR MARKING \nCurrent DPM technologies were selected using [5 The \nhandbook consists of collective industry knowledge on \nautomatic and data capture systems and provides guidance \non how to best apply the Data Matrix symbol to aerospace \nparts based on prior testing. Assessment of prior testing can \nbe used to determine the survival of part marking techniques \nin various environments The International Standards \nOrganization and the International Electrotechnical \nCommission Standard 15415 ISO/IEC-15415 the grade is lower than a ‘C’ \nduring or after service, repair, or overhaul [11]. Ref. [8] \ngives an extensive overview on the effect of the part \nenvironment on various marking processes. The Materials \nInternational Space Station Experiment \(MISSE marking processes for use in Low Earth Orbit \n\(LEO   marking tests will be assessed to determine the \ndurability of marks created from different processes.  \n4 STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF NON-INTRUSIVE \nMARKING METHODS \nDirect part marking can be applied in one of two ways nthrough non-intrusive marking or through intrusive \nmarkings. Nonintrusive markings, also known as additive nmarkings, are produced as part of the manufacturing process \nor by adding a layer of media to the surface of a part using \nmethods that have no adverse effect on the part. Intrusive \nmarkings alter the surface of a part e.g., abrade, cut, burn, \nvaporize, etc  markings can result in degradation of \nmaterial beyond the point of acceptability. Determining \nwhich technique is suitable for a given application is \ndependent on the part’s function.  \nNon-intrusive marking methods are recommended for \nsafety-critical parts \(i.e., parts which could fail, resulting in \nhazardous conditions napproved [8]. Examples of non-intrusive markings include \nautomated adhesive dispensing; cast, forge, and mold; ink \njet; laser bonding; laser engineered net shaping \(LENS stencil. Ref. [5] provides an \noverview of each of these techniques. In Table 1, some non-\nintrusive part 


marking techniques are listed along with their \ndescription, common applications, advantages and ndisadvantages.\n \nTable 1. Non-intrusive direct part marking methods. \nMARKING \nPROCESS DESCRIPTION ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES \nAutomated \nAdhesive \nDispensing \nDeposits precise amount of adhesive on a repeatable basis n \nApplications: \nElectronics \nAdvantages \n• Time/pressure dispensing is a data-driven process, flexible nsimple to operate \n• Auger system handles a wide range of adhesives \n• Piston pump systems are not as sensitive to viscosity changes; \ncapable of creating larger dots; consistency at higher speeds \nDisadvantages n• For time/pressure systems, higher speeds result in less consistent \ndots \n• For piston pump system sensitive to air in fluid and complex \ncleaning procedures \n• For auger systems, sensitive to viscosity changes \nCast Metal \nMarking \nFor DPM of investment casting parts, wax coupons are \ndirectly attached to the wax pattern of the part to be marked \nbefore being put through the investment casting process. \nFor sand casting, the Data Matrix symbol would be placed \ninto a recess of the mold pattern before the sand mold is ncompacted and formed.  \n \nApplications: \nEnd use parts subjected to high stress, Non-machined \nsurfaces nAdvantages: \n• Less costly than injection molding; relatively little residual stress \nDisadvantages: \n• Sand casting may produce rough surfaces as opposed to die \ncasting \n• Cell profiles with aspect ratios substantially greater than 1 may \nbe difficult to produce using the investment casting process \n• Coupon overall thickness less than 0.02-inch \(0.51mm such as \nattachment to wax pattern \n•  \nMolding The hot, viscous fluid is pressed or injected into a die under nconsiderable pressure, where it cools and solidifies. \nVariants of the process use gas pressure or vacuum to press \na heated polymer sheet onto a single-part mold.  \n \nApplications: \nGlasses, thermoplastics, Elastomers Polymer Foams, \nRubber \nAdvantages: \n• Elaborate shapes can be molded \n• Blow-molding and thermo-forming are rapid, low-cost molding \nprocesses \n• Adapted to materials that are viscous when molten \nDisadvantages: \n• The die must withstand repeated application of pressure, \ntemperature, and the wear involved in separating and removing \nthe part, and therefore it is expensive \nForging Characters raised or depressed depending on method of \nmanufacture, unless otherwise specified by drawing \n \nApplications: \nNon-machined surfaces only \n \n nAdvantages: \n• Can increase the strength of the final product \nDisadvantages: \n• Hot forging of metals allows larger changes of shape but \ngenerally gives a poor surface and tolerance because of oxidation \nand warpage \n Cold forging gives greater precision and finish, but forging \npressures are higher and the deformations are limited by work \nhardening \n  4 \nMARKING \nPROCESS DESCRIPTION ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES \nInk Jet Precisely propels ink drops to the part surface, after which \nthe fluid that makes up the ink dot evaporates, leaving a ncolored die on the surface of the part creating the pattern of \nmodules that make up the mark.  \n nApplications: \nPost-packaging, Warehousing, Automotive \n \nAdvantages: \n• Low entry cost \n• High speed \n• Easy to read if contrast is good \n \nDisadvantages: \n• Not considered permanent by some industry standards \n• Dot registration can vary \n• Higher cost consumables \n• Mark quality dependent on surface cleanliness \n• Difficult to read if contrast is poor \nLaser \nBonding \nAn additive process that involves the bonding of a material \nto the substrate surface using the heat generated by an Nd: \nYAG, YVO4, or CO2 laser.  \n \nApplications nMaterials with high absorptivity \nAdvantages: \n• Laser bonding overcomes the two most serious limitations of nthermocompression bonding, namely the need for high \ntemperature and high pressure, which are known to cause damage \nto the device and affect its long-term reliability. \n \nDisadvantages: \n• Coatings are application-specific \n• Generally limited to flat or slightly curved surfaces \n• Restricted to materials thicker than 0.001-inch \(0.025 mm substrate to melt the \nupper surface.

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF INTRUSIVE \nDIRECT PART MARKING \nIntrusive DPM methods require less marking area for data \nmatrix identification symbols. Thus, parts with marking \nareas significantly less than 6.75mm would benefit more \nfrom intrusive DPM techniques than from nonintrusive \nDPM techniques. Laser marking is considered the most \nappropriate technique for producing the Data Matrix symbol non small parts due to the flexibility of the laser spot size [6]. \nHowever, some laser marking machines can be large, and \nthe implementation cost of the method can be high \ncompared to other intrusive part marking methods [12]. As \npreviously mentioned, intrusive part marking methods, \nespecially laser marking, should not be used on safety-\ncritical applications because they can potentially damage a \npart. If an intrusive method 


is used for a safety-critical \napplication, careful engineering analysis and metallurgical \ntesting is required before application. The following \ndiscussion provides an overview of intrusive DPM \ntechniques such as direct laser marking methods and other \ncommonly used intrusive DPM techniques.  \nDirect Laser Marking Methods  \nThe use of lasers to mark parts is becoming particularly \npopular for the application of Data Matrix symbols. Laser \nmarking provides the following capabilities: high speed, \nconsistency, and precision [13 highly readable and \npermanent marks; marks applied at angles on complex \nsurfaces; adjustable sizing of marks to fit the available space \n[14]. However, laser marking thermally alters the surface of \nthe substrate Therefore, the engineer should consider \nseveral factors before deciding to employ laser marking. For \nbrittle materials, the process can lead to the propagation of \ncracks emanating from the regions hit by the laser. For very \nthin metals, the process could cause deformation such as \ncurling or wrinkling effects [15]. The laser irradiated \nmaterial may oxidize or burn off, melt and resolidify, \nevaporate, ablate, undergo chemical change or changes to its \nmicrostructure and physical properties [16]. Understanding \nthese and other limitations can assist in deciding the best \nmarking method for the part. Some of the latest techniques \nin laser marking include Laser Induced Surface \nImprovement \(LISI LIVD Etch \(GALE Surface Improvement—LISI™ laser marking \nuses a laser beam to melt a pre-placed powder mix of \nalloying compounds into the surface of the base metal, \nprecisely and according to the desired pattern [16]. It is nmeant to form an improved alloy with high corrosion \nresistance and wear properties. The coating, which is a nformulated powder, protects the marking from corrosion and \nwear. However, this method modifies the chemical ncomposition, microstructure and properties of the base metal \nsurface [16]. It has the potential to create undesirable defects \nsuch as pores or unwanted compounds, like brittle \nintermetallics [16]. A reduction of fatigue resistance has \nalso been observed when using a pulsed laser for LISI™ \nlaser marking [16]. A continuous wave laser may be \npreferable over a pulsed laser to limit the reduction of \nfatigue resistance nProject MISSE tested different part marking techniques \nsuch as LISI that would expose both human-readable nmarking and machine-readable marking to LEO \nenvironments \(i.e., vacuum, solar UV radiation, \nmicrometeoroids and space debris, atomic oxygen, and deep \nthermal cycles  of using the LISI process after a year exposure to \nLow Earth Orbit. The marking process received ‘passing npreflight and post-flight verification grades as defined by \nISO/IEC-15415 [11].  LISI™ laser marking has generally \nbeen used on metal parts that rust when exposed to their \nnormal operating environment. It may not be a suitable \nprocess for glass materials, but it may be modified to work \nwell with some ceramics and plastics. More empirical \ninformation on employing the process in these material \napplications is needed nLaser Induced Vapor Deposition—LIVD is a coat and \nmarking method developed by Siemens. The heat coming \nfrom the visible spectrum laser vaporizes material from a \nmarking media trapped under a transparent part. The ngenerated heat causes a buildup of gaseous vapors and \ndroplets. These vapors and droplets condense onto the ncooler transparent surface to form a hard, uniform coating \nthat is applied in a prescribed pattern. The process does not \nrequire the use of high heat or seal gas/vacuum chambers. \nThe machine-readable markings can be formulated to be \nread using optical readers and sensing devices like X-ray, \nthermal imaging, ultrasound magneto-optic, radar, \ncapacitance, or other means of sensing [5].  \nThe marking tests conducted by Project MISSE used glass \nas a base material, and the materials that were marked using \nthe LIVD process were brass and tin. The Data Matrix \nsymbol markings using LIVD all received passing grades as \ndefined by the ISO/IEC-15415. When the marking material \nwas tin, the marking process received an A for its preflight \nand post-flight verification grades. When the material was \nbrass, the process received a B for preflight and post-flight \nverification grades. This is clearly indicative that the \nmarking quality can vary for different materials. It is \nrecommended that markings applied to glass substrates \nusing the LIVD process should be applied to the interior \n\(unexposed  The process is also limited to \nlasers operating in the visible spectrum. \nGas Assisted Laser Etch—Laser marking conducted in an \nambient environment often results in a limited degree of \ncontrast between the engraved mark and the substrate \nbackground. This can limit marking speed and the number \nof different materials that could be marked. One technique \nthat could enhance contrast and increase readability in a ngaseous environment is Gas Assisted Laser Etch \(GALE is \nperformed under low power settings. An assist gas reacts \nwith the material under the influence of the laser energy to \nproduce a reactant that is a different reflective color from \nthe background. The assist gases might be reducing, \noxidizing, or inert depending upon the target material. A \nhigh contrast, readable mark is created at the coincident \npoint of the laser [8]. \nThe University of Tennessee Space Institute 


evaluated LISI \nand GALE marks for aerospace marking applications and \ndetermined that the marking processes are durable for \napplication in harsh environments [17]. Project MISSE \nassigned an overall pre-flight verification and post-flight \nverification grade of ‘A’ for GALE markings exposed to \nLEO environments after 4 years \(2001-2005 growth, and error correction. GALE \nmarkings are limited to only metallic alloys. Since the \ntechnique involves laser etching, it may create debris and \naffect the surface of the substrate. \nLaser Etching—Laser etching involves heating the substrate \nsurface to a level that causes substrate surface melting. \nLaser etching has been used in the past for enhancing the \nlabeling of automotive parts [18]. It gained popularity in the \nautomobile industry due to its ultra-high speed, which is \nessential to shortening manufacturing and delivery \nturnaround time for an ordered car. Laser etching is \nfrequently used to mark plastics that contain pigmented \nmaterials that are discolored by the laser beam in order to \nproduce a striking color contrast Additives can be applied \nto plastics that do not mark well to enhance contrast [5]. \nLaser etch is generally limited to 0.001 inch maximum \ndepth and performed at lower power settings. When using \nlaser etch on safety critical parts, it is best to coat the part \nbefore marking it. Aluminum parts marked using laser \netching had high passing preflight and post-flight \nverification grades after exposure to LEO environments \nafter a year nLaser Coloring—Laser coloring involves employing a low \npower laser to pass slowly across the substrate surface in \norder to create contrast for the marked area. The process is \nperformed without burning, melting or vaporizing the \nsubstrate material. Though the process involves fewer \nsurface disruptions than other intrusive marking methods, it \ncan have adverse effects on parts that have been previously \n  6 \nheat-treated It can reduce the corrosion resistant properties \nof some stainless steel alloys. These effects can be nminimized by adjusting laser settings. The process is not \nrecommended for parts thinner than 0.10-inch [5 nGovernment testing was conducted to assess the effects of \nchemical environments on the survivability of markings \nfrom different part-marking processes during ground and \nsuborbital operations [8]. The chemical environments \nincluded deicer, fuels, grease, hydraulic fluid, and \nlubricating oil. Part markings from laser coloring remained \nlegible when exposed to grease, but testing is not complete \nfor assessing how the markings tolerate other chemical \nenvironments.  \nLaser Engraving—Laser engraving is performed by \nvaporizing the surface of the substrate material. As the \nmaterial is vaporized, exhausted ventilation removes any \nfumes or smoke [19]. Laser engraving is expensive and \nlabor-intensive, but it is the quickest laser marking method nthat can be produced. Laser engraving markings remain \nreadable in most ground and sub-orbital operations and LEO \noperations. The marking has a lower contrast than other \nmarking processes, however. Laser engraving is acceptable \nin safety-critical applications when used in conjunction with \nthe “coat and remove” process. This process involves \ncoating a part with a medium of contrasting color that is \nremoved afterwards by the laser to expose the underlying \nmaterial. Laser engraving may produce micro cracking on \nsome materials [5]. Hence engineering approval or the \nexpert advice of a metallurgist is required before using the \nprocess in safety critical applications. Marking tests \nperformed by Project MISSE revealed high grades for parts \nthat used glass as a base material and copper as the marking \nmaterial. Direct laser engraving involves the removal of part \nmaterial, but laser engraving using the “coat and mark” \nprocess does not remove part material. \nLaser Shot Peening—Laser shot peening has been used in \nthe past to improve fatigue lifetime of Navy aircraft narrestment hook shanks [20]. The process is similar to the \nconcept used in shot peening in that it induces residual \ncompressive stress into metal surfaces. An intense beam of \nlight is directed onto the part’s critical surface which creates \nhigh-pressure plasma that generates a shock wave, driving \nthe compressive stress deep into the surface [21]. The \nsurface to be peened is under a laminar flow of water called \nthe tamping layer”. The tamping layer acts as an inertial \nstop when the high-pressure plasma is formed.  The plasma \nis formed in nanoseconds and the mass of the water prevents \nit from expanding, thus driving the energy into the work \npiece surface [21].  \nAn ablative layer is applied in the locations that will be laser npeened. The ablative layer prevents the surface from slightly \nburning. The resulting compressive residual stress lowers \nthe mean tensile stress. Cracks are generally suppressed in a \ncompressive surface. Thus, the residual compressive stress \ntypically provides excellent protection against crack \ninitiation and growth as well as fatigue failure. It is \nbeneficial to induce as much compressive stress with as \nlittle cold work as possible. More cold work results in a \nrougher surface finish along with less desirable compressive \nsurface stress [21]. It has been noted that pulse duration, \nirradiance, and number of treatment layers have the most nsignificant impact on the residual stress developed by laser \npeening. An example of such research is the considerable \neffort that has been applied to studying the modeling \nresidual stress profiles in friction stir-welded 7075-T7351 \naluminum alloy specimens [22]-[23] and high strength \n300M steel [24].  \nLaser shot 


peening marking can be used on any non-brittle \nmaterial that undergoes plastic strain upon surpassing its nstress yield point.  It will not work well on materials that \nfracture such as glass. Laser shot peening can be controlled \nby varying the pulse intensity, focal spot size and location, \nand the pulse number at each peening location. One of the \nmajor disadvantages of laser shot peening is its relatively \nslow speed and high cost in terms of the processed surface \narea. The laser pulse energy has to be sufficiently large and \nthe laser spot size has to be sufficiently small. It is mostly \nused in applications where shot peening is not applicable \n[25]. Altogether, laser shot peening is an advantageous part \nmarking method— especially for safety-critical parts that \ncannot be marked with the current nonintrusive part \nmarking methods. The marking process received a B for \npreflight and post-flight verification grades. This constitutes \nan acceptable marking quality, but represents fixed pattern \ndamage up to 9 percent.  \nOther Intrusive Direct Part Marking Methods \nOther common intrusive DPM methods used to produce \nmachine-readable symbols include dot peening electro-\nchemical marking, and engraving/milling. Dot peening \noffers low implementation and operating costs compared to \nlaser markings, but it is more time-consuming and less \nversatile in respect to material applications. Dot peening is \nhighly durable, but it can alter the surface of a part. In \naddition, dot peening can produce low contrast marks and \ndifficult readings. \nElectro-chemical marking is good for round surfaces and \nstress-sensitive parts [13], but this type of marking process \ncannot be applied to nonconductive materials. Electro-\nchemical etching produces highly durable marks, and there \nis no debris from the process. However, the process can \npotentially produce toxic by-products. Electro-chemical \ncoloring is one of the least intrusive marking processes, but \nit less durable than electro-chemical etching.  \nEngraving is great for glass, plastic, phenolic, ferrous, and \nnonferrous metals. Engraving also offers low nimplementation and medium operating costs [13]. However, \nengraving can also be time-consuming. This marking nprocess is not recommended for 2D barcode symbols.  \n  7 \nMany of these methods have been used by the aerospace, \nautomotive, medical, and pharmaceutical industries for \nyears. So unlike many of the laser marking methods \npreviously discussed, there has been an extensive amount of \ntesting for these methods in ground suborbital, and LEO \nenvironments. Ref. [8] showed that marks created using dot \npeening or mechanical engraving remained readable after \nbeing exposed to a large number of ground, suborbital, and \nLEO environments. Government testing on electro-chemical \nmarking processes has not been completed. \n6. COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS STUDY \nThe cost of implementing machine-readable Unique \nIdentification \(UID future NASA programs \nusing DPM techniques will depend on a number of factors. \nThe costs will depend on the marking methods to be used \nand where the items will be marked \(i.e., in-house versus \noutsourcing item’s characteristics will also determine \nthe cost of using a particular DPM technique. For example nfactors such as part geometries and material properties will \ninfluence the cost of marking. Recurring and non-recurring \ncosts must also be considered when determining the \nlifecycle costs of marking each item.  \nIt is essential to understand the impact of costs on Parts \nManagement. Parts Management promotes costs savings nenhances logistics readiness, reduces maintenance cost, and \nenhances interoperability [26]. The six specific drivers for \nwhich Parts Management can lead to cost benefits are: \n• Engineering and design \n• Testing \n Manufacturing \n• Purchasing \n• Inventory \n• Logistics support [26] \nFor DPM, engineering and design of Parts Management \nwould relate to the selection of marking technique, \nintangible costs, and recurring costs— the last entails \nreplication of effort, part analysis and approval, and \nmaintenance. During the testing phase it is determined \nwhether or not a marking method would be acceptable for \nthe intended use. The cost benefit here is avoiding the loss \nof resources associated with improperly applying a DPM \ntechnique. During the manufacturing phase, cost benefits are \nnoticed based on cost savings from the lack of need to \npurchase new equipment or tooling or additional storage at \nthe manufacturing site [26].  \nCost benefits are realized if the business decides to use \nexisting equipment and tools for part marking. In addition, \nany avoidance of purchasing new equipment/tools reduces \nprocurement-related costs [26]. The cost for storage \nincreases as new equipment/tools for new part marking \nmethodologies are placed in service. For logistics support nintroduction of new methods requires changes to \ninformation systems, supporting documentation \(i.e nmaintenance manual, user handbooks, etc nand equipment may also negatively affect cost benefits. \nDoD and Private Industry Cost Benefit Analysis Studies on \nUID Implementation:  \nThe DoD conducted a cost benefit analysis study of UID \nimplementation into their supply chain [27]. The study \ncompared the costs of in-house part marking with \noutsourcing part marking. The data for these comparisons \ncan be found in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. The \nmarking costs for in-house marking are significantly less \nthan outsourcing, but initial setup costs are extremely high nCost, timeliness, infrastructure, and in-house benefits are \nsome factors the DOD suggests program managers 


consider \nwhen selecting either in-house part marking or outsource \npart marking. \nA study was also conducted by A. T. Kearney on barcoding \nbusiness benefits [27]. Cost reduction and improved \nefficiency were found in the following areas: merchandising \nand sales time handling data, customer service time dealing \nwith purchase orders, finance time reconciling invoices, \ninventory out of stocks, logistics costs, warehouse and direct nstore delivery, speed to market, shelf tag and scan errors, \nand data cleaning. Smaller businesses are expected to have \nless cost benefits with implementing the 2D Data Matrix as \nthe volume of parts is a function of costs. DoD’s cost \nbenefits for marking parts with 2D barcoding are \nsignificantly greater than the cost benefits NASA would \nobserve because of its larger volume of parts. Hence, when \nlooking at historical cost benefits for 2D barcode \nimplementation, more focus should be placed on businesses \nthat work with a small to medium range volume of parts in \ntheir supply chain. This may help provide NASA with a \nbetter estimation on potential cost benefits.\n  8 \n \nTable 2.

However, because UID implementation \nhas not been thoroughly executed in the past at NASA, there \nis not much historical data to reference for estimating UID \nimplementation costs through DPM techniques. Change \nrequests \(CRs sent to contractors such as Boeing \nfrom previous missions— may be referenced to gain an idea \nof the estimated cost of incorporating the Data Matrix \nsymbol onto aerospace parts aboard NASA programs nNevertheless, implementing the Data Matrix symbol is more \nbeneficial to Mission Assurance and Quality Control. It \nincreases supportability and safety of systems and \nequipment. It mitigates the risk of human error. UID \nprovides information on what particular part was used in \nwhich implementation [26]. UID provides the history of a \npart, which can reveal its manufacturing, stresses over its \nlifecycle, and any possible faults. The UID can reveal the \nlocation of the part, for instance, if it is currently on a \nmission, disposed of or on the shelf. The bottom line is that \nthe improved management of parts, reliability, safety, and nimproved efficiency of implementing the UID can be as \nmuch of a deciding factor as any cost benefits nImplementation of UID for the International Space Station  \nThe International Space Station \(ISS uses a \nlabeling system known as the Inventory Management \nSystem \(IMS  and \nidentification system that incorporates human readable \ninformation and machine-readable information on to parts. \nThe barcode is in conformance with Code 39 barcode \nsymbology [28]. The IMS may be used to complement the \nmanufacturer or vendor label – which supplies the \nmanufacturer’s identification, part number batch-serial \nnumber and/or stock number per MIL-STD-130. The \nprimary purpose of the IMS is to provide information on the \nlocation, status, maintenance, and resupply information for \nparts. In accordance with 28], items that are too small to be \nlabeled with IMS, such as screws and other consumables, \nmust be placed in a bag. However, once these items are \nseparated from their packaging, it becomes difficult to trace \ntheir 


lineage. This could result in parts becoming \nunapproved and eventually scrapped from service. The other nlimitation of the IMS database system is that it requires \nmanual data updates or line-of-sight barcode scans, one item \nat a time [29]. This can make the parts verification process \nvery time-consuming.  \nAnother parts management issue that may become \nproblematic in the future is NASA’s use of a conservative \napproach for determining, obtaining, and delivering spare \nparts to ISS [30]. The expected lifetimes of the replacement nunits are determined by a combination of the performance of \nthe systems and the manufacturers’ predictions Thus far, \nthis has proven to be a sufficient approach. However, \naccording to the Government Accountability Office \(GAO predictions [30]. If this continues, \nNASA may find itself purchasing an excess of spare parts. \nThe GAO also conducted an assessment of several large-\nscale projects at NASA: finding that parts obsolescence and npurchase of spares contributed to the increased costs of the \nOrbiting Carbon Observatory 2 [31].  \nThe DoD in particular, has experienced problems with \nunapproved parts and an excess of spare parts in its ninventories. In an effort to achieve what is known as total \nasset visibility \(TAV materials meeting \ncertain requirements to be marked using item unique \nidentification \(IUID selected the ECC 200 Data \nMatrix symbol as the technology used to mark IUID on \nparts. An IUID supplies parts with a globally unique \nidentifier and “enhances operational readiness and efficiency \nby greatly reducing the time required for acquisition, repair, \nand deployment of items” [10]. It reduces lifecycle costs by \nreducing the amount of time it takes to conduct an inventory. \nIt improves speed and accuracy of data processing and data \ntransfer [32]. This reduction in labor time and errors would \nalso result in reduced lifecycle costs. A similar unique \nidentification policy implemented at NASA could help \nprovide the same benefits as it does for the DoD. To reduce \nthe excess of spare parts in the future, and thereby wasteful \nspending, UID can improve repair times and part reliability \nby tracking the maintenance cycle of critical parts. \n7. CONCLUSION nApplying the Data Matrix symbol using direct part marking \ntechniques helps ensure traceability of parts throughout their \nlifecycle. Direct part marking techniques that involve laser \nmarking processes may be the optimum techniques for \napplying the Data Matrix symbol to very small items where \nspace is limited. It enables more data to be stored on very \nlittle substrate space. Safety-critical parts should always be \nmarked using a non-intrusive method unless documented \nand approved for intrusive part markings. When selecting \nthe best method for a given part, program managers should \nconsider the durability, structural compatibility naffordability, and manufacturing constraints associated with \napplying the technique. Researchers are continuing tests on \nthe International Space Station to assess marking quality of \ndifferent techniques on parts manufactured from different \nmaterials and operating in Low Earth Orbit conditions. More \nempirical research is also being conducted to assess the \nquality of readability for parts after exposure to ground and nsuborbital environments and service, repair, and overhaul \nenvironments.  \nThe cost of implementing Unique Identification for \naerospace parts in future NASA programs \(and possible \ncurrent programs like the International Space Station technique, part function, environment, and method \nof manufacture \(e.g., in-house or outsourcing nthe cost and time savings from past implementation of Item \n  10 \nUnique Identification by the DoD showed the potential for \nsimilar benefits to NASA. An analysis of current data \nacquisition and part verification problems experienced on \nthe International Space Station suggests that the \nimplementation of Unique Identification can improve speed \nand accuracy of data processing and data transfer. The future \nof unique identification marking such as the Data Matrix \nbarcode promises advanced reporting of part failure for ntargeted repair, improved preparation for maintenance, and \nconservation of resources. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nC M.

SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs.

To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
