In order to keep the study back \nground clear, the majority voting method has been applied over \nthe three classification algorithms, which are the k-nearest \nneighborhood support vector machine and the C4.5 tree.

INTRODUCTION \nThis study is built on one of the high-circulating \nnewspapers in Turkey, which have special pages for economy nnews. We have collected only economy news, which are \nseparate from other news like sports or magazine, etc The \nproperties of the dataset will be explained in the experiments \nsection. We have processed the news text via the text mining \napproach called term frequency - inverse document frequency \n\(TF-IDF explained in the methodology section. \nOn the other hand, we have processed the stock market closing \nvalues by using several signal processing approaches such as \nrandom walk \(RW MA nrelative strength index \(RSI BB parameters. Finally \nwe have investigated the correlation between the features \nextracted from text mining and signal processing to compare \nthe effect of signal processing outputs into the economy news. \nDuring this correlation study, we have implemented k-nearest \nneighborhood \(KNN  C4.5  nsupport vector machine \(SVM  we have \nimplemented an ensemble classifier over those three classifiers, \nwhich are based on majority voting MaVL time series analysis methods on stock market \nvalues with the economy news.  \n \nFig. 1.  Overview of study nThe correlation between news and the stock market is one \nof the indicators of the speculative markets [4 nOne of the difficulties in this study is dealing with natural \nlanguage data source, which requires a feature extraction. The \nother difficulty is dealing with a stock market value, which is \nconsidered as a signal. On the other hand, the big data we are \ndealing with is also problematic. The dataset holds 131,248 \ndistinct words and when the feature vector of each economy \nnews item is collected, the total size of the feature vector is \nover 2.5 GByte, which is beyond the computation capacity of a \nsingle computer with these classification algorithms.  \nAnother difficulty is converting the time series analysis into \nthe classes Since we are using the classifier algorithms and \nbenchmarking their performances, the conversion is done nthrough the direction of the stock market. Therefore three \nclasses, up, down and neutral are considered the three classes \nwe aim to successfully predict from the economy news. \nA. Feature Extraction  \nWe have implemented a feature extraction algorithm 1 in \norder to extract two feature vectors n978-1-4673-6213-9/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 272 ISI 2013, June 4-7, 2013, Seattle, Washington, USA\nAlgorithm Feature Extraction Methods \n1.

Ci ç? closing_value\(date\(Ei Termj,Ei Top300\(sort\(IG economy news corpus and another from \nthe closing values of the stock market. We have limited the \nnumber of features to 300 and the Top300 function gets the \ntopmost 300 features from the feature vector.  \nThe V2 feature vector is calculated easily by checking the \nclosing value of the economy news on the date. There are some \nnews items, which are published during the time the stock \nmarket is closed like on weekends and we have considered \nthese values as a third class besides the increase and decrease \nclasses.  \nThe correlation algorithms run over the two vectors V1 and \nV2 extracted via the Algorithm 1.  \nDuring the execution of algorithm, the execution requires \nmore memory than the available hardware, where we run the \nalgorithms on a Intel 7 CPU and 8GByte of RAM. The \nrequired memory is calculated in equation \(1 139,434 words x 9871 news x 6.7      \n                                       average word length x 2 bytes for n                                    each character =~17GByte           \(1 solution we have limited the number of words with the \nhighest occurrences. The number of occurrences on our 


nimplementation is 30 and a word is taken into consideration \nafter this number of occurrences. The words appearing above \nthis threshold value are 2878 and the memory required is \nreduced to 700MByte which is easier to handle in the RAM.  \nB. Evaluation \nThe results of executions can be summarized in TABLE I. \nTABLE I. ERROR AND SUCCESS RATES OF CLASSIFICATION METHODS \t f-measure \nAverage \nRMSE RAE Correctly  \nClassified \nRandom \nWalk \n0.497 0.4182 0.9921 52.37% \nRSI 0.501 0.4404 0.9930 50.70% \nMACD 0.491 0.4174 0.9892 52.52% \nBollinger \nBand \n0.504 0.4141 0.9810 53.49% \n \nThe success rate in TABLE I is the percentage of correctly \nclassified instances. For example, the success rate of Random \nWalk with length=2 can be considered as the 37% of the \ninstances are correctly classified to predict an increase, \ndecrease or no change in the stock market value depending on \nthe economy news processed.  \nThe time series analysis method, “acceleration” should not \nbe considered because of its unsuitable data output The \nacceleration values calculated are either 0 or so close to 0, so \nthe data set expectation was not realistic. This is the reason of \nhigh success rate on the acceleration analysis. On the other \nhand rest 9 methods are suitable for the correlation and the \nhighest success is achieved from the Bollinger Band with 52 ncorrectly classified news.  \nThe value of success is highly related with the market \nstructure so the success rate here should not be understood as \nthe success rate of the methodology or the classifier. The \nsuccess rate in the table is the correlation between economy \nnews and the stock market closing values \nIII CONCLUSION  \nDuring this study, it is first time the effect of time series \nanalysis methods over the stock market closing values and their \ncorrelation with the economy news in the Turkey case has been \nstudied via an ensemble classifier. The feature extraction \nmethod and classification methods are kept simple and the \nstudy is mainly focused on the time series analysis. The \nanalysis has shown that the success of Bollinger band is higher \nthan the rest.  \nWe believe this study would help to understand the market \nstrength in Turkey from a financial perspective and also the \nstudy can help further research with other classification \nalgorithms and feature extraction methodologies. \nREFERENCES \n[1] I.

For example, healthcare or security\napplications may have a different notion of multimedia\ncontent importance than home environments. Thus, in a\nplatform that serves all verticals, it is dif?cult to decide\nwhat formulas and algorithms \(i.e., which instantiation of\na QoI calculator such as the one described in [19 used. Similarly, scoresheets such as those used in [20]\nare too ?ne-granular for the frontend of a horizontal M2M\nplatform.\nAnother idea would be to ?lter based on data classi?-\ncation. The logic would be similar to QoI assessment, but\nthe importance of the data would be judged based on the\ncategory they belong to, rather than on a QoI score. The\nused scienti?c methods are also quite different here. For\nexample, the Kobe solution [22 of Microsoft Research uses\nstandard machine learning techniques in order to classify\nthe readings of different sensors \(Sound recordings, Images,\nGPS series human voice”, “loud noise”, “fast movement”,\nand many more. In order to use similar data classi?cations\nfor performing M2M data ?ltering, we would need to adjust\nthe class de?nitions and the training methods of the machine\nlearning approach to the M2M scenario. Then, if it were\ndesired to use the classi?cation for ?ltering purposes, it\nwould be enough to provide the M2M platform operator\nwith the ability to express which classes of readings should\nbe reported to the M2M backend. However, not only are\nexisting class de?nitions and training methods immature for\nsupporting ef?cient M2M data ?ltering, but such a solution\nwould also hit against the same problem as QoI assessment\ndoes, i.e., missing techniques for the harmonic coexistence\nof various verticals.\nConsidering the pros and cons of these approaches and\nhaving examined the gaps that appear when it comes to\ntheir employment inside a horizontal M2M platform, we\nbelieve that the best approach in order to address the gaps\nof the related work is the following: conceive a solution that\nallows for the co-existence of domain-speci?c ?lters, but in a\ncoordinated, controlled, and regulated manner that does not\nharm the horizontality” of the platform. Such an approach\nis contributed by this work and presented in the following.\nIV. AN APPROACH FOR ENABLING VERTICAL\nTECHNIQUES IN HORIZONTAL PLATFORMS\nThis section describes the proposed approach after pro-\nviding a summary of its core parts.\nA. Core novel parts\nThe main points that render our solution conceptually\nand technically different from approaches such as the ones\ndescribed in the previous section are the following:\n• A system \(?ow, algorithms, and con?guration handling of various ?lters from\ndifferent verticals. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis not only the ?rst work that speci?es ?ltering as an\nindependent module of an M2M platform, assembled\nby well-de?ned components but it also has the follow-\ning novelties: \(i functions, \(ii iii management, and \(iv M2M data ?ltering logic\n• A common, system-wide logic for meaningfully ad-\njusting the thresholds of heterogeneous ?lters based\non M2M-speci?c data categorization and M2M-speci?c\nplatform structures. This includes the ?rst ?lter-\nindependent ?ltering-related algorithm, a step towards\nunifying ?lters or supporting their co-existence.\nB. Filtering ?ow and logic\nAssuming a standard M2M architecture enhanced by a\nFiltering Module on each gateway and the existence of the\nmain entities that are depicted in Figure 1\(a proposed ?ltering logic is summarized in the sequence\ndiagram of Figure 2. The entities M2M Platform Frontend,\nM2M Data Gateway, and M2M Device were already shown\nin Figure 1\(a their role\nand their position in the technical landscape should be clear.\nThe M2M Filtering Module can be understood as part of the\nM2M Platform Frontend that consists of heterogeneous ?l-\ntering functions, along with the software needed to interwork\nwith the other components, as well as some con?guration.\nIt could be a gateway component such as a software library,\na standalone gateway application or an OSGi bundle.\nBelow is a summary of the ?ow of the ?ltering system,\nwhereby the most innovative parts relate to the way the\nthreshold calculation, the automated threshold adjustment,\nand the transition from the data assessment to the ?nal data\nforwarding are handled internally:\n• Step 1: The idea is to let the M2M Filtering Module\nmaintain different \(possibly heterogeneous are adjusted each time the backend sends updated\nrequirements. Note that the actions 1.x in the sequence\ndiagram are decoupled and happen asynchronously to\nTable I\nDEFINITIONS\nR = [r1, r2...rn], ri = \(ci wi integer corresponding to a category \(or type range and mapping rules are ontology- and implementation-speci?c i.e., wi × 100% of the data -the most important- shall be stored  qi, cqi , ti  N,\nF : Set of ?lters f implemented in the Filtering Module.\nqi: Function used by fi for QoI calculation implementation-speci?c.\n\(Any logic; qi\(data  corresponding to the category of data fi is used for.\nti: Current threshold for fi; data mapped by qi below it 


are ?ltered.\nAlgorithm 1. Basic logic for thresholds adjustment\n// Input: R \(set of requirements list of thresholds 1? wi ti for\nend for\nreturn T\nthe others; the sequence only indicates an intuitively\nlogical order. As is also shown in the de?nitions of\nTable I, the requirements implicitly indicate which top\npercentage of the information of a certain category\nshould be currently reported and stored into the backend\ndatabases. A decision with regard to the thresholds is\nto implicitly de?ne many different levels for the QoI\nvalues that can be returned by each method \(i.e., timax\nlevels for the i-th method ti, ti+1 de?ned and implemented.\nOnce the above is speci?ed, “current thresholds” can\nbe set upon reception of backend requirements with\nthe logic of Algorithm 1 or sophisticated extensions of\nit. Algorithm 1 is a basic logic for lter-independent\nthreshold adjustment based on backend requirements.\nThe exact threshold adjustment approach is understood\nbetter by a combined study of the necessary de?nitions\n\(Table I illustrative examples\nthat are provided after the description of the steps of\nthe ?ow.\n• Step 2: This step refers to the standard process of\ncommunicating with the M2M devices and reading\ninformation from them. The details of this step are out\nof scope for this work. Different technologies may be\n289\ninvolved, usually using periodical, but also event-based\ntriggering of this step. The evaluation in Section V will\nbe performed with polling in ?xed intervals.\n• Step 3: For this, it is important to have established an\nappropriate set of lters. The decision here is to keep\nthe Filtering Module open to extensions, i.e., to the\naddition of new lters, not necessarily known when\nimplementing the entire proposed ?ltering framework.\nHowever, this requires the new ?lter to have two\nfeatures: Firstly, the return values of its QoI function\n\(qi split into levels. Secondly, it\ncan be meaningfully applied for a category of data \(cqi used in the system. When the\nactual data is captured from the M2M devices \(Step\n2 appropriate ?lter fi of the\nFiltering Module \(selected based on the category cqi of\nits QoI assessment function qi result, the M2M Data Gateway may\nbe allowed to report the data to the backend or not.\n• Step 4: According to the de?nitions of Table I, the ?nal\n?ltering action looks like:\nif qi\(data ti else\nreject\nwhere function v\(t may be gen-\nerated by the ?ltering module, allowing the reporting of\nthe data to the backend. The employment of an access\ncontrol mechanism in the context of data ?ltering to\nensure that a platform operator can control the rate of\nthe reported data without having to blindly reject write\nrequests is nothing obvious. In a standard approach, the\nM2M Filtering Module would forward the data by itself\nto the backend. However, the described passkey-based\nmechanism stems from the scenario-speci?c feature\nthat -according to standardization trends- the M2M\ndata gateway has components of many providers, while\nthe M2M Filtering Module is controlled by the M2M\nplatform operator.\nThe following paragraphs provide a better understanding\nof the proposed approach through an illustrative overview\nand a simple example for the system compilation and the\n?ltering con?guration.\nFigure 1 depicts a landscape with multiple gateways\nshowing how each of them may contain multiple ?lters,\nand thus multiple ?lter con?gurations, as well. Further, it\nis shown how requirements are sent from the M2M backend\nto the M2M frontend, while at the bottom of the ?gure, there\nis a zoom into two sample instances of ?lter con?gurations.\nThe following example explains what these instances could\nrefer to and how they could be set based on an example\ninstance of R.\nFigure 3. System overview with example ?lter con?gurations\nExample IV.1. Assume a ?lter f1 using as q1 an M2M-\nequivalent of the approach of [20], thus assigning to sensor\nreadings a QoI value \(? R  that evaluates the importance\nof captured video data between 0% and 100% \(refer to\n[19] for a similar example category 1 category “2 category “3 smart city scenario \(safety, energy, logistics, etc and cq2 = 1.\nFurther, due to the continuous and “score-like” nature of\nthe values returned by q1 and q2, it would be possible to\nde?ne, for example, six levels \(i.e., seven possible threshold\nvalues; t1max = 6 e.g., every 1 point, and ten\nlevels \(i.e., eleven possible threshold values; t2max = 10 10%. Running then Algorithm 1 for,\ne.g., R = [\(1, 0.75 2, 0.7 3, 0.5 the current thresholds of the two existing ?lters.\nC. Further aspects of the approach\nWhat has been presented is a formal description of the\nframework parts that help understand the innovative aspects\nof the solution. In terms of engineering and algorithmic\ndetails, many parts have not been speci?ed, either because\nthey are obvious or because they are left open to the imple-\nmentation. Such parts could be, for example, the 


software\nneeded to implement such a ?ltering middleware, the exact\nlogic of the used ?lters, or variations and more sophisticated\nextensions of Algorithm 1. Here are some further important\nfeatures of the presented solution with regard to ?exibility\nand scalability:\n• Data for which it is impossible or not desirable to calcu-\nlate their QoI can still be integrated in the solution. For\nsuch data, a trivial ?lter with two possible thresholds\ncan be employed. This can be set to either allow all\n290\nor ?lter all. Data which is critical and must always be\nsent can, of course, bypass the Filtering Module.\n• The implementation and the security levels of the\npasskey-mechanism are open. In a solution where all\nmodules of the M2M Data Gateway are implemented\nand owned by the platform operator, and thus trusted,\nthe mechanism can be implemented as a simple yes-or-\nno response.\n• Independently of the nature of a QoI calculation func-\ntion q, appropriate selection of thresholds can make\nthe distribution of the returned values approximately\nuniform, thus rendering the function suitable to be used\nby a ?lter of the presented approach.\nV. AN EVALUATION FROM THE UTILITY-MONITORING\nDOMAIN\nThe main advantages of the presented approach do not\nlie in the QoI-assessment techniques or the ?ltering ratios\nthemselves. Filtering ratios can be anyway directly con?g-\nured or set to the desired levels, while they also heavily\ndepend on the exact datasets in a way that renders general-\npurpose comparisons meaningless. Note that both the QoI-\nassessment logic of our approach and this of the other\ncompared approaches will use case-speci?c algorithms.\nThe advantages of our approach lie rather in the enable-\nment of intelligent control of the ?ltering system and in\nthe easing of ?ltering-related con?guration actions. There-\nfore, the purpose of this evaluation is not to scienti?cally\nprove and nominate the best solution”, but to measure and\ndemonstrate how our solution behaves in a real scenario\nfrom the utility-monitoring domain, and reach conclusions\nabout the bene?ts but also the limitations that are mirrored\nin the results.\nA. Scope and setup\nThe evaluation has been performed on data collected by\na middleware which NEC has deployed to monitor and\ncontrol the utilities of the Commerzbank Arena football\nstadium in Frankfurt. The middleware gives access to 13,143\nobjects \(sensors, switches, meters the utilities and has\nbeen run in a read-only, 5-minute-interval polling mode\nfor 1 day, so that 24 ? 12 ? 13 143 = 3, 785, 184 values\nhave been read in total. Although the experiment is limited\nin size, it must be considered that it refers to only one\nday and only one facility. Further, there is no issue of\nscaling with regard to the evaluated metrics, namely this\nsmall experiment is valid for examining ?ltering ratios and\napplication coverage. However, broader experiments would\nbe needed if the examined metric was the sclability of the\n?ltering software. The following setup details explain what\nhas been evaluated and how.\n Compared approaches: General-purpose ?ltering ap-\nproaches would give the same result as simple data\nforwarding, because no redundancies in the sense of\nerroneous or duplicate data have been observed This\napproach will be called BASIC and will serve as the\nevaluation baseline. Our approach will be called M2M-\nNECtar. Its implementation for this evaluation is pro-\nvided for the sake of completeness as a footnote1 Two\nfurther application-speci?c \(AS non-\nnumerical values, while AS-FILTER-2 forwards only\nchanged values.\n• Metrics: Two metrics have been used The amount of\nforwarded \(and stored S measurements, and\nthe coverage \(COV percentage of the\nexpected, i.e.,desired or useful, readings that are actu-\nally forwarded. This is application-dependent, as each\napplication may expect different readings. For the pur-\npose of our analysis we calculate this for three ?ctive\napplications: APP1 and APP2 expect exactly the data\nthat is forwarded by AS-FILTER-1 and AS-FILTER-\n2, respectively, while APP3 expects the energy-related\ndata, i.e., as if the QoI assessment functions used here\nfor M2M-NECtar were speci?cally designed for it. The\nreason for this choice was to ease comparison by having\n\(baseline of the results.\n• Variables: The dependent variables will be, of course,\nthe de?ned metrics S and COV . The only independent\nvariable is time, as all the rest \(expected readings, state\nof the utility, reading values dataset size size of the complete dataset, i.e., the amount of data\nforwarded and stored by BASIC \(not visible in the results e.g., no video, audio\nor complex data are monitored a smart city system can grow\nextremely and become very expensive over the months.\nFigure 4 presents the results of the data sizes forwarded\nand stored by using each of the ?ltering approaches, while\n1For this evaluation, M2M-NECtar de?nes three categories of M2M\ndata \(c1: energy-related sensors, c2: meters, and c3 switches dummy the respective category is assumed to be critical and thus\nweighed always with 1.0. q2 calculates the QoI 


score of a reading as the\nabsolute value of the relative change of its value since the last reading.\nEverything above 5% is reduced to 5% and assigned to the top score. q3\nassigns integer scores in the range [0, 2], i.e., 0 for unchanged switches\nin off-state, 1 for unchanged switches in on-state, and 2 for changed\nswitches. Further, t2max = 10 and t3max = 2 were de?ned, with the\nobvious \(uniform thresholds to QoI values \(v\(t requirements:\nR1 = [\(1, 1.0 2, 0.7 3, 0.7 3, 0.5 1, 1.0 2, 0.8 3, 0.2 t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 


nDuring operations many GDS system engineers rely on \nspreadsheets listing hardware properties to track their nsystems.  Spreadsheets are useful for viewing large \nquantities of data at once or for passing information between \nteams, however they also make it easy to miss mistakes or \ninconsistencies.  When different teams own different \nspreadsheets that each describe part of a single system, \nthings get out of sync very quickly.  A model enforces \nconsistency, but users are not forced to choose between the \ntraditional spreadsheet and a model.  Once information is in \nthe model, generating an editable spreadsheet view from \nthat single source of truth is trivial, as was previously shown \nin Figure 6. \nDawn’s prime mission is eight years long, so there is risk of \nthe GDS system documentation becoming out-of-date.  The \ntransition of personnel over the course of the mission makes \nit even more important to maintain a single accurate \nrepresentation of the system Capturing this information in \nthe model mitigates this risk. \n7. CONCLUSION \nOverall the Dawn GDS modeling task was a success.  \nInitially setting up and revising the hardware and software \nmetamodels took the team a fair amount of thought, but \nonce the metamodels were in place model elements were \nquickly populated from existing databases.  The process of \nimporting model elements uncovered many inconsistencies \nin the existing hardware databases, which were then \nresolved.   \n \nOnce the model was populated, it was used with great nsuccess to help the GDS team manage complexity.  A \ndiagram was established to track the locations of various npieces of hardware as well as building resources.  Scripts \nwere written to query information out of the model and give \nthe team more insight into costs and dependencies of the \nproject’s computers on other servers.   \n \nAs the team became more comfortable with the model, we \ncontinued to find new ways to make our job easier.  The \nmodel was used to understand and document complex data \nflows within the system, and also to force the GDS team to \nthink clearly about the system’s interfaces. \n \nThe team’s approach of selective modeling as time and \nmoney allowed worked well.  Modeling the GDS piece by \npiece provided incremental growth in functionality and the \nteam ended up with a fairly complete model by the end of \nthe study.  Based on the insight the team gained through this \nmodeling process, we believe system modeling earlier in the \nmission definitely would have been beneficial. \n \nThe team believes this case study shows that with \nreasonable goals in mind, even a small team without a \nsignificant amount of money to dedicate can see benefits of \nsystem modeling.  Most of the modeling and scripting in \nthis study was performed by an academic part time \nemployee working 10-20 hours per week over the course of \none year. \n \nThe team continues to use and refine the Dawn GDS model.  \nMore work should be done to explore how to automatically \naudit the model’s contents against the actual hardware in use \non a regular basis.  At the moment verifying that the model \nmatches reality is one of the most onerous aspects of \nmaintaining the model.   \n \nAnother goal of the team’s future modeling work is to ngenerate views that will be used to educate new members \ncoming onto the GDS team.  Most system description views \ngenerated during the mission’s design have become \noutdated and would not be of much benefit for people new \nto the project.   \n \nLastly, parts of this GDS model are relevant to other \nmissions using similar software deliveries and hardware.  \nBeing able to modularize the model and export it as a \nbaseline for other projects would be a key goal to strive for \n  10 \nin reducing the amount of redundant modeling work.       \n nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \nThe research described in this paper was carried out at the \nJet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of \nTechnology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration n \nREFERENCES  \n[1] OMG SysML Specification v1.3.

This is because the Linux scheduler tends to spread\nthreads across the system, and this hurts the performance of\nVWAP which is communication dominant.\nInterestingly, the performance of VWAP with “Large\nWindow” con?guration shown in Figure 14 achieves better performance \(up\nto 7 sliding windows have large working sets,\nso the contention on shared cache and memory bandwidth\noutweighs inter-thread communication. As a result, both\nTreeMatch and TreeMatch-S generate sub-optimal mappings\ndue to failure to consider resource contention. Holistic\nMapping, however, still ?nds the best mapping. This clearly\nshows the importance of holistically considering both data\nsharing and resource contention for thread mapping.\nB. LOIS Application Performance\nThe LOIS application detects outliers in radio data from\nouter space The version of LOIS used in this paper reads\nfrom a disk ?le containing a sample dataset collected from\na Scandinavian radiotelescope in Europe. Figure 10 shows\na 4-thread setup of LOIS. Thread 1 calculates point-wise\ncoordinates for each input data record which are consumed\nby Thread 2. Thread 2 and 3 maintains aggregate statistics on\ntwo sliding windows of past records. Thread 2 produces data\nto feed into Thread 3, and also synchronizes with Thread\n3 on a shared Barrier operator. Thread 4 receives from\nThread 2 and 3 the upper and lower bounds of coordinates\nderived from the sliding windows, and ?nds all outliers in\nthe incoming data record. 5-thread and 6-thread versions of\nLOIS are constructed by further introducing Threaded Ports\nto split the work of Thread 3 and 4.\nFigure 15 shows the performance of LOIS. Both\nTreeMatch-S and Holistic Mapping are able to ?nd the best-\nperforming thread mapping in all cases which outperforms\nthe worst mapping and the default OS mapping by up to\n2.4 and 1.8 times, respectively. TreeMatch, on the other\nhand, sometimes gives sub-optimal mappings. To explain\nthe difference between TreeMatch and TreeMatch-S, we\nlook at the inter-thread communication matrix and thread\ncorrelation matrix for LOIS with 4 threads. Figure 16 shows\nthat thread correlation measurements capture data sharing\nbetween threads \(especially between Thread 2 and 3 due\nto their sharing of operators using\ninter-thread communication volumes.\nHolistic Mapping achieves the same best mapping as\nTreeMatch-S for LOIS. This is because resource contention\nis not severe among threads in LOIS. Figure 17 shows the\nreuse distance histograms of 4 LOIS threads. Although the\nLOIS threads show worse temporal locality than VWAP\n\(since the histograms are more scattered towards larger dis-\ntances t into\nL2 cache. Therefore, the bene?t brought by placing thread\nwith intensive data sharing close to each other outweighs\nthe penalty of resource contention.\nIn terms of cost, Exhaustive Search has poor scalability.\nFor example, enumerating all possible mappings of 6-thread\nLOIS on 8-Core UMA machine takes 600 pro?ling runs even\nafter eliminating redundant mappings based on symmetry\nof cache topology. TreeMatch needs one pro?ling run with\nSystem S runtime’s communication pro?ling facility, but the\npro?ling overhead is negligible. TreeMatch-S needs one run\nwith binary instrumentation which can slow down VWAP\nand LOIS by up to 8×. Holistic Mapping requires two pro?l-\ning runs: the ?rst run is the same as TreeMatch-S with binary\ninstrumentation enabled, and the second one is with low-\noverhead hardware performance counter monitoring enabled.\n6259\n\(a b c nN\nor\nm\nal\niz\ned\n T\nhr\nou\ngh\npu\nt \nNumber of Threads \nOS Default Best \nWorst TreeMatch \nTreeMatch-S Holistic n0 \n0.5 \n1 \n1.5 \n2 \n2.5 \n3 \n3.5 \n1 2 3 4 5 6 \nN\nor\nm\nal\niz\ned\n T\nhr\nou\ngh\npu\nt \nNumber of Threads \nOS Default Best \nWorst TreeMatch \nTreeMatch-S Holistic \n0 \n0.5 \n1 \n1.5 \n2 \n2.5 \n3 \n1 2 3 4 5 6 \nN\nor\nm\nal\niz\ned\n T\nhr\nou\ngh\npu\nt \nNumber of Threads \nOS Default Best \nWorst TreeMatch \nTreeMatch-S Holistic \nFigure 15 Throughput of LOIS \(Normalized to the Throughput of Single-Threaded LOIS with Default OS Scheduler nSh\nar\nin\ng \nIn\nte\nns\nity\n \nT1 T2 T3 T4 \nC\nom\nm\nun\nic\nat\nio\nn \nVo\nlu\nm\ne \nInter-Thread Communication Inter-Thread Correlation \nT3 \nT2 \nT1 \nT4 \nT3 \nT2 \nT1 \nT4 \nT1 T2 T3 T4 \n1.0 1.0 \n0.0 0.0 \nL2 \nL1 L1  \nL2  \nL1 L1 \n1 3 2 4 \nMapping by TreeMatch Mapping by TreeMatch-S \nL2 \nL1 L1  \nL2  \nL1 L1 \n1 2 4 3 \nFigure 16.

The prob-\nlem of mapping a multi-process or multi-threaded program\nto a set of underlying resources to minimize program execu-\ntion time is NP-hard [8 Various heuristics have been pro-\nposed with the objective of minimizing communication cost,\nsuch as graph partitioning [5] and graph matching [19]. [24]\nimplements a OS-level scheduler which places intensively-\ninteracting threads close to each other. As shown in this\npaper, arranging data movement based on cache topology\nalone does not capture all important trade-offs and may lead\nto sub-optimal overall performance.\nContention Aware Mapping.

Memory Reuse Distance of LOIS.\ntion performance on CMPs. Hardware [21] and OS level [17]\ncache partitioning, user level thread scheduling [34], and\ncompiler-time transformation [22, 25 are proposed to mit-\nigate resource contention among processes and/or threads.\nHowever, they only work for independent threads or pro-\ncesses with no communication or sharing relationships.\nHolistic Mapping. [26 exploits thread mapping for op-\ntimizing multi-threaded datacenter applications on CMPs.\nHowever, the mapping policies in [26] either use exhaustive\nsearch or require a new algorithm for each type of cache\ntopology. Our new contributions include an in-depth study\nof streaming application’s cache behavior and a holistic\nmapping algorithm which is more general and scalable.\nB. Optimizing Streaming Applications on CMPs\nAlgorithmic Optimization of Streaming Algorithms. Exam-\nples include join [27, 11], aggregation [6], sorting [10 and\nfrequency counting [7]. Operators in a streaming program\nmay interact with each other in complicated ways and\nsuch complexity is manifested at thread level at runtime.\nManaging such complicated interaction is beyond the scope\nof tuning individual operators, so orchastration provided by\nStreamMap is necessary to coordinate threads’ execution.\nBesides, StreamMap does not require knowledge of opera-\ntors’ internal implementation, and uses pro?ling information\ncollected at middleware level to make mapping decisions.\nTherefore, StreamMap is orthogonal and complementary to\ncode tuning of individual streaming operators.\nCompile-Time Scheduling and Mapping of Streaming Pro-\ngrams on CMPs. Pioneered by StreamIt [13], work has\nbeen done in optimizing static scheduling of streaming\nprograms on multicores [16, 29, 30]. Those work apply\ncompiler analysis and code transformation to exploit various\nparallelism in program to balance computation load among\nthreads. Since most of those work target Cell B.E. architec-\n630\nture which has explicitly managed memory hierarchy, they\ncommonly try to hide data movement cost by overlapping\ncommunication with computation in the execution schedule.\nIn comparison, StreamMap targets cache topologies seen in\nx86 CMP architecture which impose distinct challenges such\nas contention on shared resources, and it works at thread\nlevel without heroic compiler analysis.\nCache-Aware Optimization of Streaming Programs. [23]\nproposed three techniques to optimize StreamIt programs\non a uniprocessor: execution scaling, buffer manager, and\nregister replacement. [20] extends execution scaling to multi-\ncore. Both work assumes synchronous data ?ow model to\ncalculate static steady state schedule, and [20] does not\nconsider thread mapping to reduce contention or thread\nsynchronization cost 4] theoretically shows that cache-\nef?cient scheduling of streaming programs on a uniprocessor\ncan be modeled as a partitioning problem and some special\ncases can be solved in polynomial time. Our work targets\nmulti-core processors, uses mapping algorithms different\nfrom the one proposed in [4], implements those algorithms\ninside System S middleware, and evaluates them with real-\nworld applications on representative architectures.\nVII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper demonstrates that CMP’s cache topology can\nhave a signi?cant impact on the performance of multi-\nthreaded streaming applications. Our StreamMap approach\nautomatically places threads 


to cores to control the data\nsharing and resource contention between threads, and can\nimprove real-world streaming applications’ performance by\nup to 1.8 times over the default Linux OS scheduler.\nFuture directions of this research are twofold. We plan to\nstudy how to use StreamMap to provide feedback informa-\ntion to System S’ compiler to optimize operator fusion. We\nalso plan to apply StreamMap to a wider range of streaming\napplications, e.g., dynamic graph analysis.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Dynamorio: Dynamic instrumentation tool platform.\nhttp://www.dynamorio.org, October 2012.\n[2] Likwid: Lightweight performance tools.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/likwid, October 2012.\n[3] Scotch: Static mapping, graph, mesh and hypergraph partitioning.\nhttp://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/, October 2012.\n[4] K.

In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
