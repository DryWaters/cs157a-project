Alnafoosi \nCollege of Computing and Digital Media \nDePaul University \nChicago, USA \nTheresa Steinbach \nCollege of Computing and Digital Media \nDePaul University \nChicago, USA \n \n \nAbstract—The amount of data stored is rapidly increasing due \nto consumer, business, scientific, and government generated \ncontent In addition to keeping pace with storing generated data, \nthere is a need to comply with laws and Service Level Agreements \n\(SLA storage are of constant concern to ensure the \nability to absorb data growth, to manage existing data and to nanalyze the data.  Evaluating data storage for IT infrastructure is \na complex task that has multiple variables.  These variables \ninclude capacity, scalability, financial, workload requirements, \nsecurity privacy, availability, reliability, analytics and \noperational.  Current frameworks that attempt to address data \nstorage evaluations focus either on a single aspect of these \nvariables or use generic IT frameworks to evaluate data storage \nas a sub-component.  The complexity of data storage \nrequirements merits a holistic framework in the data storage \ndomain.  The contribution of this paper is an integrated \nframework to evaluate and assist in selecting optimum storage \nsolution for multi-variable requirements.  This paper examines nInformation Dispersal Algorithm \(IDA to examine four \ndifferent big-data storage technologies using this framework.     \nKeywords—Data storage Evaluation; Framework; Big Data; \nCapacity; Scalability; Financial; Workload and Performance; \nSecurity Privacy; Availability; Reliability; Analytics; Operational \nI. INTRODUCTION \nIn 2007, there was over 250 exabytes \(exabyte is over a \nbillion gigabytes stored is growing at a rate of 23 percent \(Hilbert \n& Lopez, 2011 nstorage system before it reaches its capacity is an important \nvariable of consideration.  Similarly, at the organizational level, \nthe demand for big-data storage has been in capacity of \npetabytes and exabytes \(Ma et al., 2009 Hilbert & Lopez, \n2011 rate of growth are major technological \nchallenges.  Scaling big-data storage is a multi-variable \nchallenge It involves the scaling of capacity, performance, \nthroughput, and proximity.  Adding additional media devices is \nnot an optimal solution to the problem.  Hard Disk Drive \n\(HDD SSD grow their \ncapacity density are expected to increase at rate of 20 percent \n\(Fontana et al., 2012 of capacity density growth \nbreaks Kryder’s Law of doubling HDD capacity annually \n\(Walter, 2005 pose a challenge to the data growth rate \nof 23 percent.     \nThe data that is stored on this type of media has the \npotential for loss, failure or malicious attack.  Therefore more \nrobust solutions are needed to preserve data, and adhere to both \nregulations and Service Level Agreements \(SLA duplication, RAID, IDA and more recently, \nCloud, that can utilize combinations of these techniques to nmitigate the possibility of media failure and provide varying \ncapabilities and limitations.  Some solutions are optimized for \ncertain work load parameters, scale and options.  This paper \nwill explore many of these options, capabilities and limitations.   \nDue to a variety of solutions based on features, capabilities \nand limitations, there are multiple cost structures for data \nstorage.  Some solutions have both fixed and variable costs, for \nexample many RAID and IDA solutions.  Others solutions, \nsuch as tape, have lower fixed and variable costs but they \nrequire a periodic media refresh.  Another solution, Cloud \nstorage, has variable costs and uses storage as service, e.g. \ncloud storage.  A major trend indicates the cost of raw storage \ncost is decreasing.  Capacity per U.S. Dollar \(MB Stein, 2010 nstorage cost is just a portion of total cost for data storage and \nthe financial aspect will need to be aligned with capabilities \nand other technical requirements. \nWorkload profile and performance are important aspects \nsince different data storage solutions provide different \nworkload profile and performance characteristics.  Data can be \nclassified as structured \(a relational database XML unstructured \(text files, pictures and PDFs Liu & \nKrishnamurthy, 2011 terms \nof file sizes \(Mesnier et al, 2011 Ganger et al, 2001 Input-Output-Operations-Per-Seconds \n\(IOPS Cassuto et al, 2010 Bsharah \n& Less 2000 function that needs \nto be considered since data can contain sensitive information.  \nAdditionally, a collection of data files and their metadata can \nreveal information as well.  Thus the need for security has nspurred multiple measures. Some of these solutions are generic \nto distributed systems like network encryption and device \nauthentication.  Other security solutions have been tailored to \nstorage specifically like All-Or-Nothing encryption with IDA \nand tolerance of malicious storage nodes \(Vu et al. 2010 


and Information Conference 2013 \nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n948 | P a g e  \nwww.conference.thesai.org nOther security features will be discussed in more details the \nframework. \nPrivacy is of great concern to ensure that data is only \naccessed by an authorized party.  Some privacy concerns are \ncovered in security with encryption and other techniques to \nprevent unauthorized access.  Conversely, storage systems need \nto provide appropriate user control than can be configured per \nfile or collection \(Ferraiolo & Kuhn, 2009 nWith big-data the issue of availability needs to be \nconsidered.  Availability is the percentage of up time for the \nstorage system where the system is available \(Rodrigues & \nLiskov, 2005 percentage availability \nwith scheduled and unscheduled activities.   \nReliability is of major concern for big-data because of the \nscale.  Reliability is the ability of data stored in the storage \nsolution to be retrieved in its original form and without loss.  \nThe issue of reliability must take into consideration internal \nand external failures and vulnerabilities \(Li et al., 2011 combination of other factors can \naffect reliability.  Big-data storage solutions utilize many \ncomponent and media devices.  Although the percentage of \nfailure of each component is small, the number of devices used \nin the system creates high failure frequency of components and \ndevices.   \nEach component of the storage system will have its own \nMean-Time-To-Failure \(MTTF these failures and its repair \nmechanism rate Mean-Time-To-Repair \(MTTR MTTF framework uses Chen’s model for \nstorage system mean time to failure.  Chen’s model includes \nalso the number of concurrent failed devices that the system \ncan withstand.       \nOnce the big-data is stored, analyzing these large data sets \nwill be a major challenge.  There are two approaches to \nanalytics.  The first approach is for data to be moved to where \nthe computing power is located.  The second approach is to \nmove the computation to where the data is located.  The ability \nto analyze stored data is an important feature for those \ninterested in extracting more value out the data stored \(Apache, \n2013 STORAGE SOLUTION \nEVALUATION FRAMEWORK \nThere are many evaluation criteria to consider data storage nsolutions.  Frameworks have been developed that evaluate one \nparticular aspect of data storage.  Other frameworks offer a \nsolution or an algorithm for a specific problem.  These \nframeworks offer value.  Further value can be achieved by \nintegrating multiple evaluation aspects of data storage solutions \ninto a more comprehensive framework.   \nFor example, there are multiple security frameworks that \naddress security from functionality, infrastructure, application, \narchitecture, among other aspects \(Talib et al, 2012 nConversely, these frameworks do not evaluate other aspects of \nthe data storage systems.  Other frameworks evaluate data \nstorage systems on performance, network, and utilization from \nresilience perspective as the ability to withstand failures \(Khalil \net al, 2008 Bilski, 2007 implementation rather \nthan evaluation.  Some frameworks are developed to address \nchallenges in throughput or capacity efficiency \(Malensek et \nal., 2011 You et al., 2011 Nijim et al., 2007 address throughput and architecture, storage \nefficiency, security and performance combinations on specific ntechnology solutions.  Other frameworks evaluate the financial \nimpact of certain technology and algorithm optimization \(Bell \net al., 2003 evaluate few aspects of data storage technology.  A \nholistic framework is needed to cover multiple aspects of data \nstorage complexity.  The proposed framework can be expanded \nas new features and technologies develop This will allow for a \nside by side approach to compare different technologies and \nprovide a more informed decision in selecting big-data storage.   \nIII. INTEGRATED DATA STORAGE EVALUATION \nFRAMEWORK \nThe integrated data storage framework evaluates data \nstorage from ten variables.  The integrated framework includes nCapacity Privacy \nScalability Availability \nCost Reliability \nWorkload and performance Analytics \nSecurity Operational \nEach of the above variables will be explored further with \nmultiple parameters.  This framework allows an equitable side \nby side comparison between different storage technologies.  \nThis allows decision makers to compare the technologies on \nthe variables described, have a more optimum fit and expand \ndata storage technology choices for a given profile.    \nEach parameter, within the variables of the framework, has neither multiple features or a range within one feature.  One \ndifficulty we have experienced is to get exact values of many \nof these parameters since data storage solutions vendors are \nreluctant to give specific values for their product.  Conversely, \ndecision makers can get specific values of these variables and nparameters from the data storage vendors during the Request \nfor Proposals \(RFP RFQ nEach variable is important but does not address the \ncomplexity of evaluating data storage systems.  The ninteractions of multiple variables are not captured in this \nframework. These interactions and specific use cases needs to \nbe evaluated per technology instance.  For example, a storage \ntechnology may offer very large 


capacity but has a limited \nability to offer recovery from failures.  The framework \nprovides general guidelines of data storage solution evaluation \nvariables and parameters, but each solution may have nadditional features and limitation that needs to be evaluated \nfurther on a case by case basis with more granular information. \nScience and Information Conference 2013 \nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n949 | P a g e nwww.conference.thesai.org \nIV. INTEGRATED DATA STORAGE FRAMEWORK VARIABLES \nA. Capacity \nThe framework captures capacity the storage system can \nstore.  The options range from kilobytes to zettabytes with nmultiple bands between these end points. \nB. Scalability \nThere are multiple parameters that need to be considered \nfor scalability.  The first aspect is the ability to scale out; the \nability to add more storage nodes to increase the storage \ncapacity or throughput.  The second is the ability to scale up; \nthe ability to add more resources to each node to increase \ncapacity or throughput.   \nAnother aspect of scalability is the unit of raw storage \nrequired for each unit of stored data.  Some technologies, such \nas tape, can compress data thus the raw data stored on the \nmedia is less than the actual data stored.  Other technologies, \nlike RAID and IDA, increase the amount of raw data stored to \nincrease reliability.  Other technologies, such as duplication, \ndepend on making multiple copies of data for each unit of \nstored data multiple units of raw storage.  As far as the authors \ncan ascertain, this is a novel aspect of scalability evaluation and \nwas not found in literature.   \nScalability can also be evaluated from geographical aspect.  \nThe ability of the storage solution to be on both local and \ngeographically scattered sites can serve to increase reliability nand scalability.  The evaluation of geographical scalability \nexplores the ability of the data storage solution to reside in a \nsingle site, local network, wide area network or global network.   \nThe last aspect is the ability of the storage system to be \nmoved physically.  Some solutions when moved physically \nmay incur availability or reliability loss.  Whereas other \nsolution it may be prohibitive to move the storage solution nThis aspect is novel as far as we know and have not been \ncovered in literature. \nC. Cost \nOne of the major challenges in capturing financial and cost \naspects is the constant change in the market place.  Amazon S3 nand Google cloud storage have been competing on prices and \nfeatures \(Williams, 2012 that small \nscale data storage cost structures are in some cases public.  \nConversely, large scale data storage cost structures are in many \ncases private.  The approach taken in this research is to apply \nthe framework on four selected storage technologies and then \ncapture the perspective of each vendor of these technologies on \nhow their solution compares to the other technologies in terms \nof fixed and variable costs nD. Workload and Performance \nWorkload and performance is one of the most visible \naspects of the storage systems.  The framework captures the \nsystem’s ability to store the various file sizes.  Different storage ntechnologies may be able to handle a wide range of file sizes \nbut may be optimized for a certain range Since the framework \nexplore a wide variety of file sizes, latency is defined in this \ncontext as time to first byte.  Other measurements can be \nexplored further as the maximum, minimum, average, standard \ndeviation among other measurement to capture latency of the \nsystem.  The ability of the storage system to retain data is \ncaptured.  Some systems may have limitation due to media rot \n\(Baker et al., 2006 experience \ndegradation after extended period of time. \nPerformance is captured in this framework in multiple nparameters.  The range of supported rates by the storage system \nof IOPS and numbers of concurrent modifier operations \(write \nand delete read, list definition in RFP since there may \nbe dependencies between numbers of concurrent write for \nexample and latency. \nEnsuring the storage system is supported with the rest of \nthe infrastructure is captured in the next part.  The framework \ncaptures the type of network protocol supported by the storage \nsystem and the network bandwidth.  Storage meta-data is \nrecorded if localized or distributed, which affects reliability and navailability.  The framework also captures the number of access \npoints to the data. \nThe storage system interface to users and application is also \nincluded.  There are many storage interfaces with varying use ncases.  The major types are Object storage, File systems and \nBlock storage.  Within Object storage, there are Amazon S3, \nCloud Data Management Interface \(CDMI system, there is Network \nAttached Storage \(NAS NFS File System \(CIFS AFP group of Transfer protocols of File Transfer \nProtocol \(FTP Storage Area Network \n\(SAN iSCSI and Fiber Channel Protocol.  The \nlast type within Block storage is Direct Attached Storage \n\(DAS Security \nThere framework highlights the ability of the storage \nsystem to encrypt data and to manage the encryption keys.  It \nhighlights the ability of the storage system to tolerate byzantine \nand malicious storage nodes.  Framework also captures \nauthentication that is used whether using user authentication \nvia 


PKI, password or verbose.  It also capture device \nauthentication via PKI.  The framework highlights the storage \nsystem ability to certify for Federal-Information-Processing-\nStandard \(FIPS Evaluation-Assurance-\nLevel \(EAL ability for \naccess control and the level of granularity it offers.  This ranges \nfrom the system at large, to container, or by file.     \nG. Availability \nAvailability captured in framework denotes the probability \nof the system being available, up, during a year that includes \nplanned and unplanned outages.  The range starts from 99 \npercent available to 11 nines available \(99.999999999 percent the ability to distribute the \nScience and Information Conference 2013 \nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n950 P a g e  \nwww.conference.thesai.org \nstorage and functionality of the storage system on multiple \ndevices Weatherspoon and Kubiatowicz state that the \navailability of the system is the sum of the availability of its ncomponents \(Weatherspoon & Kubiatowicz, 2002 model.  This system \nreliability model inputs the number of media devices, the \nnumber of concurrent failures that can be tolerated, MTTF and \nMTTR and produces the storage system MTTF.  The failure in \nthis case means the failure of the system to retrieve the data it \nonce stored.   \nI. Analytics \nBeyond the basic operations of write, read, delete and \nlisting, storage system can derive further functionality from the \ndata it has by analyzing data further.  Analytics has been \nintroduced with Map Reduce libraries.  The framework \ncaptures the ability of the system to run analytics the available \nlibraries and the proximity of the computation to the storage \nnodes.   \nJ. Operational \nThe framework details the classification of the storage \nsystem.  Data storage system can be classified as \(Yoder et al., \n2012 an \napplication without the need to stage it in from a lower tier of \nstorage. \n2 accessible within some \nmoderate length of time, usually some number of seconds. \n3 not be accessible for an \nextended period of time, for example data on removable media \nat a remote site. The framework captures the maturity of the \nproduct in term of number of deployments.     \nV. IDA DATA STORAGE SOLUTION CASE STUDY \nInformation Dispersal Algorithm \(IDA storage space and is five to ten \nyears away from mainstream adaptation according to Gartner \nResearch Released in 2011 \(Filks, 2011 Figure 1 established \ncompanies and startups.  That list of companies that have IDA \nimplementation includes Amplidata Caringo, Cleversafe, EMC \nand Symform.   There has been multiple deployment of this \ntechnology with a sizable amount of storage in the petabytes \nscale. \n \nFig. 1. Gartner Research, years to mainstream for storage technologies. \nIDA is an error correcting code.  Error correcting codes are \ncoding techniques that encodes data and transforms it.  This \nencoded data contains additional information to ensure that \nwhen received it can tolerate a predefined amount of error.  \nThese techniques were originally developed in the \ncommunication industry where there is a need to overcome \nnoise and corruption of received messages.  The theory was \nfirst developed by Shannon in 1948.  Then multiple coding \ntechniques of error detection and error correction codes started \nto emerge.

CLEVERSAFE IDA SOLUTION CASE STUDY \nCleversafe is a Chicago based company that developed IDA \nstorage technology with object based model.  Cleversafe, as of \nFebruary 13, 2013, has 30 issued patents and has 243 patents \npending.   Cleversafe offers a big-data storage solution that \nuses IDA technology to achieve a high level of scalability, \nsecurity, reliability and lower cost.

Cleversafe also \nuses TLS, SSL, SNMPv3 with AES to secure its distributed \nstorage system.

Within each variable, there are \nparameters to assist in expanding on each variable.  This paper \ncovered IDA technology its background and features.  This \npaper explored Cleversafe’s IDA storage solution within the \nintegrated framework.  We were able to describe within the \nintegrated framework the IDA storage solution and where it noptimally fits within the storage solution offerings.  This paper \nis the first part of research papers using the above methodology \nScience and Information Conference 2013 \nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n954 | P a g e nwww.conference.thesai.org \nwith Tape, RAID and Cloud storage technologies.  The \nframework enhances the ability of decision makers to evaluate \nand compare storage technologies side by side.   \nIX. RESEACH METHDOLOGY \nThis paper is part of multiple paper research that explores \nTape, RAID, IDA and Cloud storage technologies.  The \nframework was created based on literature review of storage \nevaluation frameworks.  The methodology of the research is to \nconduct case studies and then evaluate against the described \nframework Then next step will be to compare these storage \ntechnologies case study finding to formulate recommendations nfor where each technology optimal performance within the \nframework.  For this paper, we conducted a structured \ninterview with the Vice President from Cleversafe. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Hilbert, M., & López, P 2011 332\(6025  2012 for TAPE, HDD, and NAND Flash: Implications \nfor Data Storage Applications.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
