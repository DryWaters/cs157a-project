However, traditional replica\nplacement strategies towards load balance usually produce scat-\ntered replica layouts which disable power proportionality, while\nrecent strategies towards power proportionality are typically\nbased on uniform replication which compromises the ability of\nload balance. In this article, we introduce Superset \(an organized\nnon-uniform replica placement strategy load\nbalance and power proportionality into consideration. The main\nidea is to partition the whole system into multiple uniform\nreplication based subsystems with the accommodated ?le subsets\nsatisfying the ‘superset condition. We have conducted a series\nof simulations with real-world distributions of data popularity.\nOur results show that, compared to state of the art solutions,\nSuperset consumes less energy to ful?ll the same performance\nrequirement while offers better performance subject to the same\nenergy consumption constraint.\nI INTRODUCTION\nReplication-based distributed storage architecture is very\npopular in practice [1]. As a core part under the architecture,\nreplica placement strategy attracts much attention, for it is of\ngreat signi?cance to both performance guarantee and opera-\ntional cost reduction which are two important issues in data\ncenters and clouds.\nReplica placement strategy greatly affects the utilization rate\nof system resources 2] \(such as disk space, I/O bandwidth,\netc could leave some resources wasted and severely lower\nthe overall performance. Therefore, early replica placement\nstrategies mainly focused on load balance and produced scat-\ntered replica layouts \(or named pseudorandom replica layouts However, no effort was made to reduce the\npower consumption, which accounts for a signi?cant fraction\nof total operational costs [3-4]. All nodes were required to be\npowered up regardless of system workload ?uctuation hence\nthe power consumption rate in trough hours was approximately\nsimilar to that in peak hours, resulting in server energy\ninef?ciencies [5].\nPower proportionality \(i.e., the energy consumed is pro-\nportionate to the workload completed of load variation [6]. A common practice is to\npower down a proportionate number of nodes during lightly-\nloaded hours. However, with a scattered replica layout, there\nare extremely few nodes allowed to be powered down even\nif the system is least loaded, subject to the constraints of\ndata availability. Whenever the number of the nodes powered\ndown exceeds ? \(? is the replication degree some data become unavailable. Therefore,\npower proportionality is disabled under traditional replica\nplacement strategies towards load balance [7].\nRecently, several replica placement strategies [7-8] have\nbeen proposed to enable power proportionality. To the best\nof our knowledge, these strategies are based on uniform\nreplication \(i.e., creating the same number of replicas for each\n?le popularity is non-uniform and\neven highly skewed in a wide range of real-world applications\n[9]. The mismatching between uniform replication and non-\nuniform data popularity severely impairs the ability of load\nbalance, leading to degraded performance.\nIn a word, existing replica placement strategies either dis-\nable power proportionality because of scattered replication,\nresulting in energy inef?ciencies, or impair the ability of\nload balance because of uniform replication, resulting in\ndegraded performance. Hence, a novel non-uniform replica\nplacement strategy is under investigation towards both power\nproportionality and load balance. The main challenges are\nthree-fold. The ?rst one is how to assign different replication\ndegrees to different ?les to ?t the skewed distribution of data\npopularity, so that load balance could be achieved within a\nsmall amount of disk redundancy. The second one is how\nto layout the non-uniform replicas in an organized way, so\nthat power proportionality could be enabled. The last but not\nleast is how to adapt to the volatility of data hotness. Since\ndata popularity is usually time-variant, a stationary replica\nlayout is not competent to permanent load balance. With the\nchanges in replication degree or replica locations, the power\nproportionality should always be enabled and the overhead in\nchanging the layout should be minimized nContributions of this paper are summarized as follows.\nFirstly, we formally de?ne the non-uniform replica placement\nproblem. Secondly, we present a solution namely Super-\nset with the layout enabling power proportionality and the\nreplication degree assignment policy providing load balance\nguarantee. Lastly extensive simulations were conducted with\n2013 International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data\n978-1-4799-3261-0/14 $31.00 © 2014 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CBD.2013.34\n139\nreal-world distributions of data popularity. The results show\nthat our strategy improves I/O throughput, reduces energy con-\nsumption while 


causes lightweight data migration as data hot-\nness varies. Our non-uniform replica placement strategy lays a\nsolid foundation for the construction of high-performance and\ncost-effective distributed storage systems.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section\nII gives a review of related work Section III states the problem\nwhile Section IV discusses two naive replica layout paradigms.\nOur strategy namely Superset is described in details in Section\nV, and extensive simulation studies are illustrated in Section\nVI. Finally, Section VII concludes the whole paper.\nII. RELATED WORK\nReplication-based distributed storage system is a well in-\nvestigated topic and a number of proposals exist in literature\ndealing with replica placement for the sake of reliability\nimprovement, performance guarantee and cost reduction.\nThe proposals for reliability improvement developed around\ntwo levels. On a single ?le level, its multiple replicas prefer\nto be placed on several distinct nodes which are failure-\nindependent \(e.g., in different racks   focused on tradeoff between parallelism in\ndata rebuilding and survivability under multiple node failures\n[12]. For example, Mirroring partitions nodes into several\ngroups, with nodes in the same group accommodating the\nsame ?le replicas. Data survivability is extraordinarily strong\nwhen multiple failures occur simultaneously, but the degree\nof parallelism in data rebuilding is decreased, thus prolonging\nthe time spent in data repair. Chain [13] is a solution where\neach node replicates its allocated ?les onto its predecessor and\nsuccessor nodes. The degree of parallelism in data rebuilding\nis increased while data survivability is compromised. Random\nreplica placement maximizes the degree of parallelism in data\nrebuilding, but most prone to data loss[12].\nEarly studies for performance guarantee and provisioning\ncost reduction mainly focused on load balance. They could be\nfurther divided into two categories: static replica placement\n[14] and dynamic replica placement [15].\nStatic replica placement implies that both the replication\ndegree and the replica locations for each ?le are time-invariant.\nTo avoid popular ?les replicated on the same subset of\nnodes, the layout is usually pseudorandom so that replicas\nare suf?ciently scattered. A typical solution is Kinesis 2],\nwhere nodes are partitioned into ? disjoint segments that are\napproximately equally sized, with each segment associated\nwith an independent hash function. For each ?le, the ? hash\nfunctions yield ? nodes \(one in each segment probability is low that two ?les are mapped\nto the same subset of nodes, thus increasing the opportunities\nfor load balance.\nBesides a scattered replica layout, studies on static place-\nment strategies also investigated the policy for request distri-\nbution among multiple replica nodes for further load balance\nimprovement. A typical solution is D-SPTF [16] where each\nclient request is sent to all the replica nodes that accommodate\nthe requested data. Once receiving a request, the replica node\nchecks whether the requested ?le data are in its cache. If\nso, it immediately sends the data to the client and noti?es\nother replica nodes to delete the request from their queues.\nOtherwise, it puts the request into its local queue. Whenever\nsome replica node takes out a request from its queue for\nexecution, it also immediately noti?es others to delete the same\nrequest from their queues.\nDynamic replica placement indicates that both the replica-\ntion degree and the replica locations for each ?le may change\nduring its life cycle. Studies mainly focused on the following\ntwo problems. The ?rst one is how to determine the new layout\n\(a layout contains the complete information on each ?le’s\nreplication degree and its replica locations between the improvement in load balance\nand the overheads in changing the layout from the initial state\nto the new one. The second problem is how to schedule the\nmigration tasks to bring the system into the new layout as\nquickly as possible. A typical dynamic solution is CDRM [17]\nwhere a name node, which constantly monitors the popularity\nof each ?le and the load status of each node, makes decisions\non new replica creation and existent replica deletion. A new\ncriterion referred to as node blocking probability is adopted\nin the selection of accommodating nodes for new replicas.\nAlthough the system greatly bene?ts from load balance,\nthere are signi?cant inef?ciencies in energy consumption. An\nimportant way to energy ef?ciency is power proportionality\nwhich is disabled by scattered replica layouts towards load\nbalance.\nRecent studies proposed new replica placement strategies\ntowards power proportionality. Two typical solutions are Sierra\n[8 and Rabbit [7]. In Sierra, nodes are partitioned into several\nequally sized gear groups, with each group containing one\nreplica for each ?le. The number of the gear groups powered\nup is adjusted according to system workload ?uctuation for\nenergy ef?ciency. In Rabbit, nodes are partitioned into several\ngroups of different sizes with each group containing one\nreplica for each ?le. All nodes are sequentially numbered in\na ‘smallest group size ?rst’ order. The number of the ?les\ncontained in each node, except those in the smallest sized\ngroup where each node takes the same share in accommo-\ndating the ?les, equals the total number of the les divided\nby the sequential node number. Therefore, more ?les will be\nallocated to nodes with smaller 


sequential numbers. Rabbit\nachieves ?ne-grained power proportionality in that nodes are\nallowed to be powered up or down one by one.\nBoth Sierra and Rabbit are based on uniform replication.\nHowever, the distribution of data popularity is non-uniform\nand even highly skewed in many real-world applications.\nA typical skewed distribution is Zipf, in which the number\nof the requests accessing the ?th most popular ?le takes a\nproportion equaling ???/?. With a uniform replication based\nlayout, nodes that accommodate more hot data will become\nbottlenecks which severely impair the ability of load balance.\n140\nIII. PROBLEM STATEMENT\nAs discussed above, the uniform replication based place-\nment strategies towards power proportionality impair the\nability of load balance in real-world applications where the\ndistributions of data popularity are non-uniform. Hence, we\ninvestigate a solution for achieving both power proportionality\nand load balance from the perspective of non-uniform repli-\ncation. In this section, we ?rstly introduce several de?nitions,\nthen describe the non-uniform replica placement problem in a\nformalized manner.\nA. Basic de?nitions\nSorted ?les: We suppose that ?les are sorted in a descending\norder of popularity, and ?? denotes the ?le whose rank number\nequals ? \(i.e, ?? is the ?th most popular ?le function\ndenoted by ?, with the variable ? representing the ?le popular-\nity rank and the function value representing the assigned\nreplication degree for the ?le ??. It could be considered as\na non-increasing function, indicating that the ?le ? ?? will be\nassigned with a replication degree no greater than the ?le nif the popularity rank ?? is bigger than ?.\nCut point: An integer ? is named a cut point if ?\(?+1  We use ? to denote the total number of cut points.\nThe complete set of the ? cut points is named ??? which\nis expressed as {???1 1 of\n?les ranking from 1 to ?1, the ?le subset ???\(2 and the\nlast ?le subset ??+1 composed of the left ?les. Consequently,\n?les in the same subset share the same replication degree.\nWe use ?? to represent the replication degree assigned to\nthe ?le subset ??\(1 1 1 in\na descending order of popularity \(i.e., ?1, ?2, ?3, ?4, ?5, ?6\nand ?7 which is a non-\nincreasing function, satis?es that ?\(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1. We can conclude that\nthere are totally two cut points with ?1 = 1 and ?2 = 3. The\n?les are partitioned into three subsets, with the ?rst one ?1\ncomposed of a single ?le ?1, the second one ?2 composed of\ntwo ?les ?2 and 3, and the third one ?3 composed of four\n?les ?4, ?5, ?6 and ?7. The replication degrees assigned to the\nthree ?le subsets satisfy that ?1 = 4, ?2 = 2 and ?3 = 1.\nB. Problem decomposition\nWe concentrate on the systems with the ‘write-once-read-\nmany’ workload pattern, in which the load is mainly caused\nby reading requests. Besides, we assume that ?les are equally\nsized and mainly focus on the effects of skewed distributions\nof data popularity. Finally, nodes are assumed to be homoge-\nneous, i.e., they are equipped with the same storage capacity,\nI/O bandwidth, etc.\nThe non-uniform replica placement problem could be di-\nvided into two sub problems.\nSub problem 1: How to determine the cut point set ???\nand the replication degree ?? for each ?le subset ???\nThe solution to this sub problem could be expressed with\ntwo sets of integers. One is 1 ? ? ? ?}, and the other is\n{?? ?1 ? ? ? ? + 1}. From the two sets i.e where ? is the maximum integer satisfying that\n? ? ???1 + 1 or the minimum integer satisfying that other words, the solution to Sub problem 1 implies the\nreplication degree assigned to each ?le.\nSub problem 2 How to place the non-uniform replicas\namong different nodes?\nWe assume that there are totally ? ?les to be stored\nonto ? nodes. ?????? denotes the complete set of ?les and\n?????? denotes the complete set of nodes. The solution to\nSub problem 2 could be expressed with a replica placement\nmatrix ??×?, in which each element equals either zero\nor one. If ??? = 1, a replica of the ?le ?? is placed on the\nnode ?? . Otherwise, there is no replica of ?? placed on ?? .\nThe placement matrix satis?es the condition expressed in the\nfollowing equation:\n??\n?=1 de?ne\nseveral relationships between node \(or node subset or ?le subset given replica placement matrix\n??×?, if the element ??? equals one \(i.e., the node ?? stores\na replica of the le every\n?le belonging to the ?le subset ? , we say that the node ??\ncovers the ?le subset ? .\nA node subset covers a ?le: If a node belonging to the\nnode subset ? covers the ?le ??, we say that the node subset\n? covers the ?le ??.\nA node subset covers a ?le subset: If a node subset ?\ncovers every ?le in the ?le subset ? , we say that the node\nsubset ? covers the ?le subset ? .\nIV. TWO PARADIGMS OF NON-UNIFORM REPLICA LAYOUT\nSince scattered replica layouts disable power proportion-\nality, an organized replica layout is at the core of the overall\nsolution to the non-uniform replica placement problem. In this\nsection, we introduce two naive replica layout paradigms to\nexplain the principle behind our strategy Superset which will\nbe described in details in 


Section V.\nA. Disjoint layout paradigm\nAs stated in Section III, ?les are partitioned into \(? + 1 subsets with ?les in each subset sharing the same\nreplication degree. If there exists a partition ? which separates\nnodes into \(? + 1 covering any ?le in the\nsubset ?????? ? ?? , the layout is named a disjoint layout.\nUnder a disjoint layout the whole system is partitioned into\n\(?+1 On one hand, existing uniform replication\nbased strategies could be employed in each subsystem to\n141\nenable power proportionality. On the other hand, assigning\ndifferent replication degrees to different subsystems could\nachieve load balance.\nHowever, the disjoint layout causes high migration cost.\nWhen the popularity of a ?le increases to a certain degree so\nthat more replicas are required to be created, all of its existent\nreplicas are also required to be migrated to other nodes. The\nreason is that the ?le belongs to a new le subset and all its\nreplicas are required to be created on nodes belonging to the\nnew node subset.\nB Arbitrarily joint layout paradigm\nA joint layout means that there is no partition ? meeting the\ncondition stated in the above subsection. An arbitrarily joint\nlayout is a special joint layout satisfying that ? is the only\nnode subset that covers a ?le subset ?? .\nThe arbitrarily joint layout reduces migration cost compared\nwith a disjoint layout. Whenever the replication degree of a\n?le is required to be increased, all its existing replicas are still\nvalid, while only the increased replicas need to be created.\nHowever, under an arbitrarily joint layout, the replicas are\nscattered suf?ciently among different nodes so that power\nproportionality is disabled. As long as the number of the nodes\npowered down exceeds ??+1 which is the replication degree\nassigned to the least popular ?les, some data may become\nunavailable.\nV. THE SUPERSET SOLUTION\nIn this section, we present the design of our Superset solu-\ntion to the non-uniform replica placement problem. The overall\nsolution mainly consists of four aspects: organized replica\nlayout paradigm non-uniform replication degree assignment,\nreplica migration policy and node power-down policy, with\nthe ?rst two aspects together forming the replica placement\nstrategy.\nBoth the policy for replica migration and that for node\npower-down are dependent on the replica placement strategy,\nand all the three components depend on the collection of\ninformation on data popularity and load status of each node.\nSince the information collection is similar to that in existing\nsolutions, we omit it in the following description.\nA. The Superset layout paradigm\nThe two naive replica layout paradigms presented in Section\nIV provide insights into the design of our Superset layout.\nWith the disjoint layout, nodes in the subset ?? are only\nallowed to accommodate the replicas of the ?les assigned\nwith the replication degree ?? , thus a general non-uniform\nreplica placement strategy is obtained through partitioning\nthe nodes into \(? + 1 with each node subset\nemploying an existing uniform replication strategy towards\npower proportionality. With the arbitrarily joint layout, a node\nis allowed to accommodate the replicas of the ?les assigned\nwith any replication degree. Since ?le replicas enjoy a greater\nfreedom in their locations, the system is more adaptive to\nhotness variation with lightweight data migration.\nOur Superset layout tries to absorb the merits of both Just\nlike the disjoint layout, the Superset layout also allows a\npartition which separates the nodes into 1 Different from the disjoin\nlayout, the ?le subsets are not disjoint, but satisfying the\n‘superset condition below: ? ?1 = ?1, ? ??+1 = ? ??\n?\n??+1 =??+1\n?=1 ??\(1 We\nconclude that a node in the subset ?? is only allowed to\naccommodate the replicas of the ?les assigned with a total\nreplication degree no smaller than ?? .\nFor example, ? equals two and the nodes are separated into\nthree subsets. The node subset ?1 only covers the ?les in the\n?le subset ?1, the node subset ?2 covers both the ?les in the\n?le subset ?1 and that in the ?le subset ?2, while the node\nsubset ?3 covers all the les. In other words, ?3 covers the\nthree ?le subsets ?1, ?2 and ?3.\nB. Replication degree assignment\nIn the above subsection, we determined how to layout ?le\nreplicas onto different node subsets for a given replication\ndegree set {?? ?1 ? ? ? ?+1}. In this subsection, we focus on\nhow to determine the value of each and how to separate the\n?les into \(? + 1 i.e., to ?gure out the cut point\nset {???1  number of ?les denoted by ? could be\nextremely large, leading to a wide scope of popularity ranks,\nwe argue that the ?les are assigned with only a few kinds of\ndifferent replication degrees for low management complexity,\nmeaning that \(? + 1 equations:\n?? = ?\(?? 1 1  2 1 3 assume that there are totally 127 ?les and\n4 cut points \(i.e., ? = 127, ? = 4 2 = 15 and ?1 = 7.\nStep 2: Computation for replication degrees\nWe use ?? to denote the number of ?les covered by the\nnode subset ?? , then we get\n?? =\n????\n???\n??\n?=1\n???? = ?1 +\n??\n?=2\n\(?? ? ???1 1  


1 4 1 2 3 1 ? ? ? ?? 1 5 6 4 5 6 7 7 covered\nby the node subset ?? is approximately half of that covered\nby ??+1.\nWe use ?? to denote the number of nodes contained in the\nnode subset ?? . We de?ne ?? as follows.\n?? =\n{\n?? \(1 1 8 the equation \(8 7 8 n{\n2???+1 \(1 ? ? ? ?? 1  9 2???+1??+1. Therefore, ?? = 2??+1, meaning that\nthe replication degree assigned to each ?le subset ?? could\nbe twice of that assigned to ??+1. For example, if ? = 4 and\n?5 = 1, we can get ?4 = 2, ?3 = 4, ?2 = 8 and ?1 16.\nC. Replica migration policy\nAs data hotness varies, the popularity rank of each ?le may\nchange. We use to denote the initial ?le popularity rank and\n?? to denote the new rank.\nNew replicas for the ?le are required to be created only if\nthere exits some integer ? that satis?es ? > ?? and ?? ? ?? . We\nuse ?? to denote the minimum integer that satis?es ?? ? ??? and\n??? to denote the maximum integer that satis?es ? > ?????1 We\nconclude that the number of new replicas to be created equals\n??? ? ???? , with \(?? ? ??+1 each node subset\n??\(?\n? ? ? ? ??? ? 1 integer ? that satis?es ? ? ?? and ?? > ?? . We\nuse ?? to denote the minimum integer that satis?es and\n??? to denote the maximum integer that satis?es ?? > ?????1.\nWe conclude that the number of existing replicas to be deleted\nequals ??? ? ???? , with ?? ? ??+1 ones deleted in each node\nsubset 1 nodes to power down.\nWe use ?max to denote the maximum I/O throughput, and\n?min to denote the I/O throughput with only the nodes in the\nminimum cover set powered up. When the system workload\nequals ? , the number of the nodes powered down could be\n?gured out through: ?down = ??max{?0, ?0+\(???0 n?min max ??min the minimum cover set are not allowed to be\npowered down. All the other \(? ? ?0 same\nprobability to be powered down.\nVI. EVALUATION\nA. The setup\nWe have implemented two queuing systems in C++ to\nrespectively simulate Sierra and Superset in replica placement\nand request distribution among replicas and conducted a series\nof simulations to evaluate Superset’s improvement in I/O\nperformance, reduction in energy consumption and overhead\ncaused by data migration.\nUnder the Superset layout paradigm, the system is sepa-\nrated into several subsystems where uniform replication based\nstrategies are employed. In the simulation, each subsystem\nadopts the replica placement strategy in Sierra. Recall that in\nSierra, nodes are equally separated into several gear groups,\nwith each group accommodating the same set of ?les and\nreplicating each ?le only once. Different gear groups generate\nindependent mappings of ?les to nodes.\nFor both Sierra and Superset, request distribution among\nreplicas resembles that in Kinesis where the request is sent\nto all nodes that accommodate the requested ?le and the least\nloaded one \(whose request queue length is the shortest among\nall the replicas system is correlated with\nthe application’s workload characteristics which could be\nexpressed through the request arrival pattern and the popularity\ndistribution among different ?les.\nIn the simulation, the request arrival process obeys the\nPoisson distribution and two kinds of popularity distributions\nare considered. The rst one is the Zipf distribution which\ntypically describes the skewness of data popularity. The latter\nis collected from the real-world application Youku \(the largest\nvideo website in China are respectively shown in Fig. 1 and\nFig. 2. The horizontal axis represents the ?le popularity rank,\nwhile the vertical one represents the proportion taken by each\n?le in the total retrieval requests. The two ?gures only show\nthe top 100 ?les. We also show the log plots which cover all\nthe ?les investigated in the simulation studies, as shown in Fig.\n3 and Fig. 4. The ?gures indicate that the Youku application\ndoes not strictly obey Zipf distribution, for Fig. 4 does not\nshow a straight line.\nOther parameters\nIn the simulation, there are 240 homogeneous nodes. All\n?les are equally sized. The space redundancy ratio ? = 3, thus\nthe number of cut points 4. Regardless of fault tolerance,\nwe assume ??+1 = 1.\nB. I/O throughput improvement\nUnder the two distributions of data popularity, we compare\nthe I/O performance of our solution Superset with the existing\nsolution Sierra when the same number of nodes are powered\nup.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.

Besides, system workload always shows a\ndaily ?uctuation pattern. The two characters have posed great\nchallenges for achieving load balance and energy ef?ciency in\nlarge-scale distributed storage systems. Traditional scattered\nreplica layouts towards load balance require all nodes to\nbe powered up regardless of system workload, leading to\nenergy inef?ciencies, while recent uniform replication based\nlayouts towards power proportionality compromise the ability\nof load balance resulting in degraded performance. Therefore,\na novel organized non-uniform replica placement strategy is\nunder investigation to achieve both load balance and energy\nef?ciency.\nIn this paper, we de?ned the non-uniform replica placement\nproblem and proposed our strategy namely Superset. The main\nidea is to properly partition the whole system into multiple\nuniform replication based subsystems that adopt different\nreplication degrees. For each subsystem, existing uniform\nreplication based strategies towards power proportionality are\nemployed. Furthermore, we design a policy for replication\ndegree assignment which ensures a positive correlation be-\ntween replication degree and ?le popularity, and present a lazy\nreplication degree update for migration cost reduction, under\nwhich replica migration only occurs when the popularity rank\nrises to a degree that surpasses the hotness boundary. Exten-\nsive simulation studies have been conducted with real-world\ndistributions of data popularity. The results show that Superset\n145\nimproves I/O performance reduces energy consumption while\ncausing lightweight data migration.\nAlthough the ef?ciency of the Superset solution is shown\nthrough experimental study, it is not clearly revealed in theory.\nIn future work, we will investigate how to select cut points and\nhow to assign replication degrees in accordance with the skew\ndegree 


of data popularity, so that Superset could work even\nmore ef?ciently.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis research work is partially supported by the Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China under grant No. 60973122, the 973\nProgram in China under grant No. 2009CB320705, and 863\nHi- Tech Program in China under grant No 2011AA040502.\nREFERENCES\n[1] P.

datasets are \nproduced by two or more Map Functions, joining among \ndifferent datasets is widely applied in ConMR. There are a \nnumber of research papers to address the problem of joins \nusing MR related solutions Broadcast join is proposed in \n[18] for one dataset is relatively small. This dataset can be \ncopied to each computing machine for conducting join \noperations at local file systems. Different join algorithms are ncompared in [19]. One-phase-join mentioned in [20] uses a \nfiltering-join-aggregation model to deal with Map-Join-\nReduce. Research papers [21][22] optimize multiple joins \nusing Lagrange relaxation method. In [23 the authors \npropose matrix-based method to balance the input and \noutput dataset size for different Reduce Tasks. In [24], \nHilbert Space Filling Curve is proposed to deal with multi-\nway theta-join problem. \nRestore 25] has been used to keep intermediate results \nfor future workflow use. Unlike this method, our data reuse nis share-aware and corresponding optimization is offered. \nVI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper, we propose ConMR, a concurrent MR \nprogramming model. ConMR addresses the need to define \nmultiple independent MR sub-jobs to provide a solution to a \ncomplex problem. Besides this, ConMR reduces the amount \nof work by taking into account data sharing at the job  and \nfunction levels. To summarizes the main contributions.  \n\(1 We propose a concurrent MR framework ConMR \nwith multiple heterogeneous map and Reduce Functions. \nThe shared data of different map and Reduce Functions are \ndefined by programmers to guarantee the data sharing is nimplemented in an efficient manner. \n\(2 levels. For job-level data sharing, the \nframework manages the data by replicating data to ensure \ndata locality. For function-level data sharing, it provides \noptimization by supplying the shared data to multiple Map \nTasks from different Map Functions. It also merges the \noutput of the same Map Functions on the shared data. \n\(3 nMatching. Results have demonstrated up to 4X performance \nspeedup compared to traditional non-concurrent MR n \n \n678\n  \nFuture work will focus on the following three directions. \n\(1 Handler to process \ndifferent Map Functions, we can optimize it further by \nmerging the outputs of the intermediate key-value pairs. For \nexample, we can merge the outputs of MF11 and MF13 in \nFig. 2\(a intermediate key-value pairs can be like \n<EI00, PS, 12000, 96> et al.  \n\(2 method using a large \ncluster size on both a public cloud and a private cloud. \nCurrently we are using up to eight instances on Amazon \nEC2. The advantage of the programming model will be \nfurther amplified given a larger cluster size. \n\(3 programming model \nwith built-in support for job- and function-level optimization. \nAcknowledgments: This publication was made possible by \nNPRP grant # 09-1116-1-172 from the Qatar National \nResearch Fund \(a member of Qatar Foundation acknowledge Amazon for providing \nresearch grant for using Amazon web services. \nVII.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
