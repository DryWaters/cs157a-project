[3] \nCondition \(1 will be hashed to \nsame bucket in a high probability  \nCondition \(2 be hashed \nto same bucket in a low probability \n2.3 MapReduce \nMapReduce[4] is a popular programming framework to \nsupport data-intensive applications using shared-nothing \nclusters. In MapReduce, data is represented as key, value system \(DFS k1,v1 k2,v2 nreduce\(k2,list\(v2 k3,v3 intermediate key-value pairs. Reduce function accepts \nan intermediate key and its corresponding values, and nproduces a list of key-value pairs as the final result \nfigure 1 shows the data flow in a MapReduce computation. \n \n \nFigure 1: Data flow of Mapreduce [5] \n \nThe computation begin with a map phase in which the map \nfunctions are applied on different partitions of the input data. \nThe \(key, value map functions are hash-\n530\npartitioned on the key. For each partition the pairs are sorted \nby their key and then sent across the cluster in a shuffle phase. \nAt each receiving node, all the received partitions are merged \nin a sorted order by their key. All the pair values that share a \ncertain key are passed to a single reduce call. The output of \neach reduce function is written to a distributed file in the DFS. \nTo reduce the network traffic caused by repetitions of the \nintermediate keys k2 produced by each mapper, an optional ncombine function for merging output in map phase, \ncombine\(k2, list\(v2 k2, v2 n2.4 Main idea of similarity join for time sequence \nOur algorithm consists of 4 steps, firstly we transform the \nhigh-dimensional time sequence to frequency domain using \nDiscrete Fourier Transform \(DFT get all \ncandidates similar object id pair according to the theory of \nLSH, we calculate signature for each using LSH Hash \nfunctions, and take as candidate if two object has the same \nsignature, more ever, to avoid false positive affect, we \ncalculate multi signatures for each object. Then, we do de-\nemphasis for the candidate similar object pair from the result \nof second step to cut down the consumption in step 4.At last nwe use the original object file and candidate id pair to verify \nwhether the object pair’s similarity is lager then the threshold \n, join all verified object pair and complete our algorithm. \nIII. SIMILARITY JOIN FOR TIME SEQUENCE \nIn this section, we describe the detailed processing method \nand data flow for each step and for simplicity we consider the \nsituation R = S. \n3.1 Dimensionality Reduction \nIn this step, we take input as the Time sequences data file \nwhich contains time sequence data with id, we use the DFT to \ntransform the time sequence from time domain to frequency \ndomain, and combine the first few coefficients to a point in nlow-dimensional domain, and we kept the data id in the new \ntransformed data file. Figure 2 show that the data flow of  \ntransforming the time sequences to 4-dimension points. \n \n \nFigure 2 Data flow of Dimensionality Reduction \n \n3.2 Get Candidate Pairs \nBased on the result of step 1, this step is to get all ncandidate pairs using Locality Sensitive Hash functions. We \ndivide the hash function into a few groups, hash value in a \nsame group compose a LSH hash signature. We identify \ndifferent signature by the group id. This 


stage performs a \nMapReduce Job. Figure 3 shows the data flow of the Job: \n \n \nFigure 3 Data flow of Get Candidate Pairs \n \nIn detail, in the map phase, we take input as the DFT \ntransformed data and calculate several signatures for each \nobject. The output key is the combination of each signature \nand it’s group id the output value is id. In the reduce phase, \nfor each value in a same value list with a same key, we out put nall the interactive value pairs <id1,id2>, make sure that \nid1<id2.In conclusion, we formalize the map tasks and reduce \ntasks in the step below: \nMap: <k1, v1>   ->    < k2, k1> \nReduce: <k2, list \(k1 k1> \nk1 is DFT id, v1 is value, =\(group id, signature group id. \n3.3 De-emphasis \nNotice that there may be an object which has more than \none same signature with other similar object, they will be \noutput from step 2 for more than one time, but in step 4, verify \ntwo high dimensional time sequence‘s similarity is never a \nsmall consumption for the high dimension of original data if \ndon’t de-emphasis, there will be many unnecessary repeat \nsimilarity verifications between objects.  \nSo this step is to delete all repeat id pairs from step 2, we \ntake input as the result from step, and output all candidate \nsimilar object id pairs. This step is also implemented by a \nMapReduce job. Figure 4 shows the data flow of the \nMapReduce Job. \nThe map function reads candidate similarity id pairs from \neach data split, for each id pair, it output a <key, value>, \n531\nwhere key is the combination of two ids, value is arbitrary nvalue \(we use 1 for example and outputs a <key, \nvalue>, where key is the small one between the two ids, value \nis the other one. \n \n nFigure 4 Data flow of De-emphasis \n \n3.4 Similarity Verification \nThis step is to verify all candidate similar objects, and \noutput the objects pair in which two objects’ real similarity is \nlarger than the threshold , this step is consist of two \nMapReduce Jobs. Figure 5 shows the date flow of the two \nMapReduce Jobs. \n \nFigure 5 Data flow of similarity verification \n \nThe first MapReduce Job is to get a temp result for this \nstep: in the Map phase of the first MapReduce Job, map \nfunction reads two types of files and output differently. For \nthe result file from step 3, for each input id pair<id1,id2>,map \noutputs two key value pairs <id1,\(id1,id2 id1,id2 For the original time sequences data file, map output a \n<key, value> for each object where key is the object’s id and \nvalue is the object’s value. In the Reduce phase, reduce \nfunction recognize object’s id combination and object’s value \nin each value list with the same key, for each object id pair, \noutput a <key value> pair where key is the id combination \nand value is the unique object value. As for the second nMapReduce Job, this Job based on the result of the first \nMapReduce Job, the map function output the same key value \npair as it read, that is  key is the combination of object id pair \nand value is the object value reduce function will get two \nvalue for each key ,one value is the object value whose \ncorresponding id is one of the id in key, and the other value‘s \ncorresponding object id must be the other id in key, for each n2-length value list, the reduce  function calculate their \nsimilarity using  the similarity formula \(1 defined in \nsection 2, and check if the similarity is larger than threshold , \nif  true ,output a <key value> pair where key is the smaller id \nin the ,value is the other id, otherwise, output nothing. \nAfter this step, all similar objects are joined in the reduce \noutput of the second MapReduce Job. \nIV. EXPERIMENTIAL EVALUATION \n4.1 Experiment Setup \nWe evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms \non a 8-node cluster each node has an Intel\(R TM Ubuntu 12.04 operating systems with installed \nJava7 and Hadoop 1.0.2. We measure the performance in term \nof execution time as well as speedup and scaleup. \nWe test several time-sequence datasets with varied dataset nsize in our experiments. Specially, we generate several \nsynthetic data sets with varying the number of time-sequence \nfrom 10,000 to 200,000 with the length 50. \n4.2 Experiment Result \nIn our experiments, we evaluated the effects of the dataset \nsize n, and the number of nodes k for MapReduce. By default, \nn =100 000, k =4. \nFirstly, we study the scalability of our algorithm. We \nvaried the number of time-sequence n from 10,000 to 200,000. \nThe execution times are shown in Figure 6, we can see that the \noverall execution time of our algorithm increases nearly \nquadratically when we enlarge the data size. This is \ndetermined by the fact that the number of time-sequence pairs \nincrease quadratically with the data size. But when data size \nvary from 100000 to 200000, the time increased slower than \n532\nthat from 50000 to 100000,it’s shows the advantage of our \nalgorithm when dealing with big data. \n \n \n \nFigure 6 Running time for different Data size \n \nWe now measure the effect of the number of nodes k. We \nvaried k from 2 to 8 in our experiments. Figure 7 shows our nexecution time of our algorithm implemented in different \nnumber of machines. From the results, we can see that as the \nnumber of nodes increases, the performance of our algorithms \nis also improved effectively. It proves the extensibility of our \nalgorithm. \n \n \nFigure 7 Running time of different number of Nodes \nV RELATED WORKS \nThe most related works to similarity joins of time series \nare those studies on spatial join

Recently, there has been \nconsiderable interest on supporting similarity join queries over \nMapReduce framework. In [10, 5], they study how to perform nset-similarity join in parallel using MapReduce \nMore related studies to our work appear in [11]. In [11 nthey study showed that by using a combination of four novel \nideas they can search and mine truly massive time series for \nthe first time. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we study the problem of answering \nsimilarity join for a massive of high dimensional time \nsequences using Locality Sensitive Hash and MapReduce. We nproposed a 3-steps approach and explored several solutions \nfor each step. By using the DFT, our proposed approach is \nable to deal with high dimensional data situation, we showed \nhow to find candidate pairs efficiently using LSH, and we \nshowed how to deal with a massive data using mapreduce for \neach step Extensive experiments performed on synthetic \ndatasets on Hadoop demonstrate that our proposed methods \nare efficient and scalable. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Rafiei D, Mendelzon A.

platforms. However, the perfor-\nmance degradation of I/O subsystem affects its working\non data-intensive applications. Taking advantages of data\nlocality is an important method to reduce communication\ncosts of MapReduce applications process and relieve stress\nof the master.\nIn order to solve this problem, this paper introduces\na novel GVMC framework based on data locality. We\nmonitor the impact of the overloaded master. We make use\nof data locality in virtual machines which located in the\nsame physical machine. The experiments results show that\nour GVMC ef?ciently achieve lower communication costs,\nhigher performance and good scalability. The performance\nof GVMC improvement is up to 16.5% and 36.2% for\nCPU-intensive applications and I/O-intensive applications,\nrespectively.\nAs a future work, we plan to consider node fault\ncosts, which is common case in MapReduce applications.\nIf any fault nodes happen, its re-execution operations\nslows progress rate down seriously. Tasktracker failure\nwould cause re-computing and speculative execution and\nJobtracker failure would lead to system dump which is\ndisaster for mapreduce clusters.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis research is supported in part by the grants of the\nNational Science and Technology Support Project of China\n\(project no 2011BAH04B05 project no. 61202077 Research Funds for the Central Universities\n\(project no.

datasets are \nproduced by two or more Map Functions, joining among \ndifferent datasets is widely applied in ConMR. There are a \nnumber of research papers to address the problem of joins \nusing MR related solutions Broadcast join is proposed in \n[18] for one dataset is relatively small. This dataset can be \ncopied to each computing machine for conducting join \noperations at local file systems. Different join algorithms are ncompared in [19]. One-phase-join mentioned in [20] uses a \nfiltering-join-aggregation model to deal with Map-Join-\nReduce. Research papers [21][22] optimize multiple joins \nusing Lagrange relaxation method. In [23 the authors \npropose matrix-based method to balance the input and \noutput dataset size for different Reduce Tasks. In [24], \nHilbert Space Filling Curve is proposed to deal with multi-\nway theta-join problem. \nRestore 25] has been used to keep intermediate results \nfor future workflow use. Unlike this method, our data reuse nis share-aware and corresponding optimization is offered. \nVI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nIn this paper, we propose ConMR, a concurrent MR \nprogramming model. ConMR addresses the need to define \nmultiple independent MR sub-jobs to provide a solution to a \ncomplex problem. Besides this, ConMR reduces the amount \nof work by taking into account data sharing at the job  and \nfunction levels. To summarizes the main contributions.  \n\(1 We propose a concurrent MR framework ConMR \nwith multiple heterogeneous map and Reduce Functions. \nThe shared data of different map and Reduce Functions are \ndefined by programmers to guarantee the data sharing is nimplemented in an efficient manner. \n\(2 levels. For job-level data sharing, the \nframework manages the data by replicating data to ensure \ndata locality. For function-level data sharing, it provides \noptimization by supplying the shared data to multiple Map \nTasks from different Map Functions. It also merges the \noutput of the same Map Functions on the shared data. \n\(3 nMatching. Results have demonstrated up to 4X performance \nspeedup compared to traditional non-concurrent MR n \n \n678\n  \nFuture work will focus on the following three directions. \n\(1 Handler to process \ndifferent Map Functions, we can optimize it further by \nmerging the outputs of the intermediate key-value pairs. For \nexample, we can merge the outputs of MF11 and MF13 in \nFig. 2\(a intermediate key-value pairs can be like \n<EI00, PS, 12000, 96> et al.  \n\(2 method using a large \ncluster size on both a public cloud and a private cloud. \nCurrently we are using up to eight instances on Amazon \nEC2. The advantage of the programming model will be \nfurther amplified given a larger cluster size. \n\(3 programming model \nwith built-in support for job- and function-level optimization. \nAcknowledgments: This publication was made possible by \nNPRP grant # 09-1116-1-172 from the Qatar National \nResearch Fund \(a member of Qatar Foundation acknowledge Amazon for providing \nresearch grant for using Amazon web services. \nVII.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
