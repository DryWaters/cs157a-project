While these models can bring more details, rendering\nthem becomes a challenge because of more triangles to be\nrendered, which consuming more computing resource. On\nthe other hand, large-scale mesh means larger data size,\nwhich requires considerable throughput capacity.\nCloud computing is now the mainstream technique for\nlarge-scale data processing due to its low cost but high\ncapability and scalability [1]. More and more data analysis\nsystem are migrating to cloud computing platforms, and\nlarge efforts are made to match the MapReduce model\nfor effective computing. Meanwhile researchers realize the\nimportance to investigate the on-platform visualization prob-\nlems recently [2].\nThis paper proposes an interactive rendering approach\nfor large-scale meshes with hundred millions of triangles\non the cloud. Our approach can be roughly divided into\ntwo parts: rasterization as pre-processing and a rendering\nweb service for interactive multi-resolution visualization.\nFor the ?rst part, we leverage the MapReduce framework\nFigure 1. Illustrative rendering of the boeing and town model by our\nproposed method, both rendered at a resolution of 20480×15360, here we\nresize them to 4000×3000 to ?t into the pdf.\nwhich is a de-facto parallel computing model to rasterize\nlarge-scale meshes rapidly. In order to realizing parallel\ncomputing, we ?rst investigate two fundamental methods\nwhich employ pixel-based and triangle-based strategy for\ndata transmission, respectively. Based on the visual analysis\nof performance bottleneck of the two methods, we propose a\nnovel adaptive algorithm to mix advantage of both strategies\nfor optimized parallel computing. Experiments show that our\nadaptive algorithm can rasterize different kinds of meshes\nef?ciently.\nIn order to follow the trend of mobile computing, the\nrendering part is designed to be a web service. Complex\n3D meshes are converted into well organized pixels after\nrasterization, which are sorted by their depth and location\nin the image space. Therefore the rendering service merely\nneeds to read a bunch of pixels, to determine visibility and\n2013 13th International Conference on Computer-Aided Design and Computer Graphics\n978-1-4799-2576-6/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CADGraphics.2013.52\n345\nto shade colors in low computing cost according to user\ninteraction.\nCompared to many sophisticated parallel rendering sys-\ntems, our proposed solution is a lightweight one coupling\nwith cloud computing, while it can satisfy all kinds of user’s\nrequirements for exploring into those meshes. The main\ncontributions of this paper are:\n1. an interactive visualizing solution for cloud computing\nplatforms that aims at interacting and rendering large-\nscale meshes in high details;\n2. a novel optimized parallel rasterization algorithm based\non MapReduce and\n3. an enhanced block-wise representation for web-based\nhigh resolution rendering.\nII. RELATED WORK\nIn this section we brie?y review three related topics: large-\nscale mesh rendering, MapReduce model and the represen-\ntation of layered depth image .\nA. Large-Scale Mesh Rendering\nIn the research of rendering large-scale mesh, there exits\ntwo basic strategies: \(1 2 two strategies are often combined together\nin order to achieve promoted rendering performance Mesh\nsimpli?cation reduces the data size of large-scale meshes\nwith the minimal impact on the rendering quality \(e.g.\ncontrol the error inside one pixel hardware. A straight-\nforward method to simplify mesh is to progressively reduce\nits vertices and faces until a simple one [3]. Other methods\nare proposed to represent mesh in different formats, e.g. [4]\nsimpli?es parts of a given mesh that is beyond a distance to\nthe viewpoint to voxels, which can signi?cantly reduce the\ndata size of the mesh and the computing resource it’s needed\nto render it. Simpli?cation usually combines with level of\ndetail \(LOD   


view distance.\nThe parallel rendering strategy speeds up rendering by\nsplitting a whole job into several sub-jobs and dispatching\nthem to different computing nodes [6], [7]. Most work of\nparallel rendering focus on GPU level or using fundamen-\ntal GPU clusters to rendering large-scale meshes in real-\ntime. And many hybrid and adaptive methods have been\nimplemented [8], [9], just as in this paper. From a different\nperspective, we aim at leverage the computing resource of\nthe cloud itself to couple data processing and rendering\ntogether in the same platform, which shares the similar\nthinking of in situ computing [10].\nSeveral existing systems have been implemented in a\nsimilar way as in our paper. That is rendering remotely, and\nsending back the result to the client for displaying [11], [12],\n[13]. The remote end of these systems are usually supported\nby complex clusters, and each interaction from users will\ncost much computing resource. In this paper, we put most\nof the computing in the preprocessing step, so it is much\nlightweight compared to the existing systems.\nB MapReduce\nMapReduce [1] is ?rst proposed by Google as a parallel\ncomputing framework. It has been widely applied after that,\ne.g., for analyzing DNA [14] and for dense computing jobs\nin machine learning [15] etc Meanwhile, much extension\nhas been done to enhance the original MapReduce mod-\nel, to support directed acyclic graph \(DAG for its open source, highly\nscalable upon thousands of machines, ready distributed ?le\nsystem and its simplicity. End users can utilize MapReduce\nwithout considering messy details of parallelization, such\nas communication, job scheduling, fault-tolerance and data\ndistribution. Instead, the key work is to adjust the Map\nand the Reduce function for effective parallelization. All\nthese advantages have motivated internet companies all over\nthe world to provide cloud-computing service based on\nMapReduce [16], [17].\nAlthough MapReduce has gained attention in both a-\ncademia and industry, only a few researchers begin to cross-\nlinks among graphics, visualization and cloud computing. [2]\nmakes a detailed analysis of MapReduce and implements\nseveral basic graphics algorithms based on it, and [18]\npioneers using MapReduce for massive image editing. It\nremains an open question to optimize MapReduce based\ncomputing for visualization.\nC. Layered Depth Image\nLayered depth image \(LDI  virtual\nreality. When interpolating a new view from several nearby\nviews, if there is only a picture for each nearby view, then\ncaused by occlusions, there might be some ”holes” in the\nnew view. LDI is designed to solve this problem, it stores\nmultiple pixels in each location in image space. Thus, even\npixels are hidden in the nearby views, they can contribute\nto construct the new view.\nIn this paper we introduce an enhanced data structure\nof LDI \(ELDI our purpose is to\noffer re-organized information of mesh for interactive online\nrendering and interaction. See Section V for details.\nIII. METHOD OVERVIEW\nMethod overview is shown in Figure 2. The input of\nour method is triangle soup, in which imported triangles are\ngrouped into different ’Objects’ labeled with assigned ob-\nject ID’ for sematic interaction. The whole process pipeline\nconsists of two parts: a based on MapReduce.\nb method incorporates two major compo-\nnents: parallel rasterization based on MapReduce and a rendering service\nbased on web. Generated from parallel rasterization, ELDI acts an inter-\nmediate data structure for online rendering.\nleverages the parallel computing ability of MapReduce to\nrasterize large-scale mesh in a relatively short time and\nstores the results in the format of ELDI. The latter part\nrenders the ELDI data and shows the ?nal results to users.\nIV. PARALLEL RASTERIZATION USING MAPREDUCE\nThe challenges in rendering large-scale mesh are: \(a resource; \(b to place most of the computing in\na preprocessing step, which can also control the size of\nthe data to be inside an acceptable range. We ?nd that\nsimply doing the rasterization can meet our demands. And\naccording to Section II-B, MapReduce suits well for such\na kind of job.\nAs mentioned before, the preprocessing is essentially\na rasterization of large-scale mesh, when designing the\nrasterization pipeline based on MapReduce we considered\nfollowing issues: \(a b communication\(data transfer c consider load balance as well; and \(d Fundamental Methods\nWhen designing the processing scheme based on MapRe-\nduce, we ?rst tried two fundamental methods: triangle-based,\nand pixel-based method, respectively. Their functionalities\nare the same when taken as a whole Figure 3\(top and Reduce step:\n\(a TPR top a pairs, with the key being\nthe number of the segment this triangle covers, and the\nvalue being the information 


of the projected triangle \(see\nTable I\(a methods for rasterization based on MapReduce.\n\(a b method, where\nST decides the optimal processing path for each triangle to minimize the\ntransferred data size.\n\(a 104 Bytes b 27 Bytes  UINT32[2]\ndepth DOUBLE[3] DOUBLE\nnormal DOUBLE[9] 14BITS[3]\nuv DOUBLE[6] 14BITS[2]\nobjectID UINT32 18BITS\nTable I\nSTRUCTURES OF PIXEL AND TRIANGLE RECORD.\ndistributed to the same reducer. Finally, each reducer\nrasterizes received triangles, sorts pixels in each pixel\nposition by their depth and dumps them into les, one\nfor each segment.\n\(b PPR Figure 3\(top \(b triangles, converting them into pixels.\nFor each pixel, it emits exactly one < key, value >\npair, with the key being the same as that in TPR, while\nthe value being the information of the pixel \(see Table\nI\(b TPR, pixels are distributed by their keys,\nbut this time, pixels within the same segment will also\nbe sorted according to their depth in the shuf?e step.\nThus, the Reduce Step only need to write those pixels\ndirectly to the disk, also one ?le for each segment.\nWe can see that in Pixel Record\( Table I\(b texture coordinates in\nTriangle Record will be used for interpolation in the Reduce\nstep, while the Pixel Record is already the nal result, no\nmore interpolation is needed.\nB. Visual Analysis\nAt ?rst glance, it is easy to see that the computing resource\nrequired for both methods are the same. However when we\n347\napply them on real cloud platform, we ?nd that the perfor-\nmance of TPR and PPR for different input meshes is very\ndifferent. In order to analyze running details intuitively, we\ndesign a new visualization scheme of the whole procedure\nof a MapReduce job as below:\n• Different saturation of blue background encodes differ-\nent computing nodes.\n• The horizonal axis represents the processing time.\n• Each rectangle encodes a Map or Reduce task. Those\nweaker machines will have less rectangles, and also\nlower in height.\n• Different colors of the rectangles encode different types\nof tasks, see Figure 4 \(g less than three\npixels are displayed without border.\nFigure 4. Visualization of different jobs in different parallel rasterization\nmethods. \(a b-c d-f g helps us understand greatly on\nhow a MapReduce job is executed. Here we choose several\ntypical jobs as example:\n\(1 a of the\nLOD structure. We can see that the bottleneck occurs\nin the Reduce step. Because there are more than 300\nmillion triangles in the mesh, when Triangle Record\nis used for communication between Map and Reduce,\nthe total message size becomes very huge. And it is\nalso because the nonuniform distribution of the triangles,\nsome reduce tasks have to rasterize more triangles than\nothers.\n\(2 b-c the PPR method on the\nmuseum and the town model respectively. Both jobs are\nperformed at the ?fth level of LOD. In contrast to the\nprevious case, the bottleneck occurs in the Map step.\nBecause there exists many relatively large triangles in\nboth scenes, some map tasks will produce and dump\nmore pixels than others.\nC Adaptive Method\nAccording to above visual analysis, we conclude that the\nsize of data that need to be transferred between Map and\nReduce will affect the ef?ciency of the job signi?cantly,\nand both methods \(TPR and PPR automatically choose the suitable computing\ntask from TPR and PPR for each triangle, thus making the\nrasterization more ef?cient, we name this adaptive method\nan Adaptive Parallel Rasterization \(APR method.\nThe key idea in APR is how to choose the right method\nfor each triangle T . Suppose P is the size of Pixel Record,\nT is the size of Triangle Record, and n is the number of\npixels rasterized from T , which is estimated by T ’s area AT\non the projecting plane. Then the data size need to transfer\nfor a triangle in TPR is T , while in PPR it is AT P . So, we\nde?ne\nST = T ?AT P \(1 work ?ow of our\nAPR method is shown as Figure 3\(bottom jobs\nvisualized in Figure 4\(a-c d-f the APR method\ncan perform close to or better than the better one of the two\nbasic methods, see Figure 5.\nV ENHANCED LDI\nAfter rasterization, unorganized graphics data are sampled\nin pixel format along with their normal, depth, texture\ncoordinates \(uv store those pixel-wise information\nin an enhanced LDI data structure, called ELDI. As we\naim at rendering mesh in extremely high resolutions in this\npaper, In order to make the exploration more convenient\nin a small screen and reduce the burden on the server,\nthe hierarchical feature of LOD is naturally integrated in\nour ELDI representation. Also, in order to parallelize the\nrendering service, ELDI data at each LOD level is distributed\nstored by ?x-sized tiles in image space. See Table II for\nthe details of the LOD structure.\nlevel

Pre-processing cost of different models with 3 methods at all levels.\nFor there is not need for random accessing in our current\napplication, pixels are stored sequentially in ELDI. See Table\nIII for the data structure of ELDI.\nforeach pixelPosition\nUINT32 - number of pixels\nforeach pixel\n14BITS[3] - normal\n14BITS[2] - uv\nFLOAT32 - depth\n18BITS - object ID.\nTable III\nSTRUCTURE OF ELDI.\nAs one can see from the de?nition of ELDI, quantities\nsuch as normals, uv and object IDs are compressed since we\nwant to make ELDI data as compact as possible for online\nrendering. For object IDs, we use an 18 bits encoding instead\nof original 32 bits. For ?oat data such as normal and uv, we\n?rst map a ?oat into the range of [0.5, 1] to keep the same\nsigns bit and 8 exponent bits. Then we cut the ?rst 9 bits\nand the last 9 bits to make the ?oat represented in 14 bits,\nalthough it will loss some of precision in a considerable\ntolerant. As for depth, it needs to be precise for handling\ncomplex mesh, and is not compressed.\nThe difference between ELDI and original LDI is twofold.\nFirst, beside pixel-wise information such as depth that is\nalready de?ned in the origin LDI structure, ELDI also\nincludes information of normal and object ID. In order\nto support ?exible texture mapping, color quantities are\nreplaced by uv in ELDI. And information such as splatIndex\nare dropped in ELDI. Second, to make the rendering service\nmore ef?cient, ELDI is stored in distributed mode by size-\n?xed tiles in image space.\nVI. WEB RENDERING SERVICE\nThe rendering part of our approach is implemented as\na web service within the browser-server architecture.In the\nweb service, the ELDI data is imported based on user inter-\naction and the results are displayed in a web page. Thanks\nto the ELDI structure, our approach can provide convenient\nonline user interaction and generate rich rendering effects\nfor large data visualization Figure 1 shows some of the\nrendering results. In this section, we will discuss details\nof interactions and rendering effects provided by our web\nservice.\nA. Online user interaction\nFirst of all, based on the ELDI with LOD structure, we\ncan provide several basic interactions, such as pan, zoom\nin/out and undo/redo. Secondly due to the well organized\nnature of ELDI, we can also provide following advanced\ninteractions.\nExplore inside After parallel bacterization, all necessary\nspatial occlusion along observation rays are recorded in\nELDI structure, including those ”hidden” pixels, which\nenables user to explore the deep inside of complex meshes.\nHere, we provide two interactions for users to tell the system\nwhich part should be hidden \(or be transparent a sliders to\ncontrol 6 axis directions \(±X,±Y,±Z the\nbounding box by sliding those sliders. Those objects\noutside the bounding box will be hidden or rendered\ntransparently, see Figure 6.\n\(b way to hide some objects, that is sketching.\nUsers just need to draw strokes in the web page, objects\nthat have intersection with those strokes will be ?ltered,\nsee Figure 7.\nFigure 6. Axis ?ltering to exclude objects of the Boeing in 6 directions\nChange light position. Based on normal and depth\nquantities of pixels, the web service shades models with\na local illumination model such as Phong model. Therefore\nusers can interactively change the light position as they like,\nsee Figure 8.\n349\nFigure 7. Sketching ?ltering to exclude objects of the Town. \(a b different shading\neffects.\nFigure 9. Center-?xed rotate. The red circle indicates the screen center.\nChange view point. The rasterization based method\nproposed in this paper is a view-dependent one, that is, we\ncan only see from the direction at which it is rasterized. So,\nin order to compensate for this defect, we perform parallel\nrasterization under multiple view points. Those view points\ninclude eight chosen evenly on the circle above the mesh,\none above the center of the mesh and one under the center\nof the mesh. And view directions are all from the view point\nto the center of the mesh.\nIn order to improve user experience, we ensure that\nrotations are center-?xed. That is, the object at the center\nof the previous view point is still at the center after the\nview direction is changed, see Figure 9.\nB. Illustrative Rendering.\nAs ELDI is basically a pixel-based representation, it is\nstraightforward to implement pixel-wised shading in our\napproach, such as Phone shading. Our rendering service\nemploys it as a default shading effect. Again, thanks to the\nELDI structure, we can achieve illustrative rendering effects\nbeyond that, for complex models up to hundred millions\npixel resolution ef?ciently.\nContour rendering. Contours can convey information\nabout shape and it is an important aspect for illustrative\nrendering. In this paper, we employ an image-space al-\ngorithm for computing semantic contours based on edge\ndetection. we ?rst extract edge maps based on normal, depth\nand object ID information separately, then combine them to\nobtain reasonable contours, see Figure 1.\nNon-photorealistic rendering. Compared to Phong shad-\ning model, non-photorealistic rendering \(NPR depict\nricher geometric details when visualizing complex meshes.\nWith the help of ELDI, the NPR lighting model 


proposed\nin [20] is seamlessly integrated in our rendering service, see\nFigure 1.\nTransparency rendering Large-scale meshes are always\nwith complex structures, which are occluded from each\nother. Contour rendering and NPR is not enough to help\nusers to explore interior of those meshes. Transparency\nrendering becomes a necessary component of illustrative\nrendering. As pixels are already sorted by depth in ELDI,\nwe only need to read and render pixels one by one, then\nadapt transparency blending[21] from front to back.\nMixed rendering To better display the mesh, we enable\nusers to turn on/off each of the illustrative rendering effects\nmentioned above, thus achieving full functional illustrative\nrendering effects. Figure 1\(top which\ninvolves all the rendering effects provided by the rendering\nservice.\nC. Caching\nAs mentioned before the web service renders resultant\nimage tiles on demand. When there are multiple users, there\nis a great chance for the rendering results to be reused. So we\ndesign a caching strategy to improve user experience For\neach rendering request, we ?rst compute a hashing string\nbased on the rendering parameters, and save the rendering\nresults in directory named according to the hashing string.\nWhen a new request is received from browser, asking for\nrendering an image tile, the web service will check the\nhashing string in an in-memory map structure before actual\nrendering. The service returns cached rendering results if\nthe the hashing string existed in the map, and performs real\nrendering otherwise. For the sake of avoiding hashing colli-\nsion, we choose the MD5 coding scheme for hashing [22].\nExperiment shows that caching scheme works well, and can\nimprove user experience signi?cantly.\nVII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nParallel rasterization in this paper is done in a cluster\nconsists of 1 name node and 3 working nodes, and the server\nof web rendering service is a PC. See Table IV for details\nof hardwares.\nA. Results\nIn this paper, data from preprocessing is stored as pixels,\nso the size of the data grows only linearly with the depth\ncomplexity of the mesh. Its disadvantage is, for a small\nmesh, the size of the pixel representation may be much larger\nthan its original representation. While its advantage is, for a\nlarge mesh, no matter how large its original size is, the size\n350\nType Number CPU Memory Disk\(7200rpm 8 logic cores 4T\nworker node 3 Intel Xeon E5530 ×22.4GHz \(16 logic cores 4 logic cores Obviously, the\nlatter one is of much more importance. see Table V.\nTo see whether caching is useful, we count the average\nresponse time in the test, which is done by using a script\nto simulate a series of interactions Response time here\nmeasures from the time a user ?nishes his interaction to\nthe time the rendering of the corresponding view ?nished in\nthe web side. From Table V we can see that all average\nresponse time are several seconds. But cause the ?nal result\nis rendered tile by tile, it will not make the users feel waiting\nfor a long time. When cache is turned on, average response\ntime is much shorter, all inside half second.\nWhen a fancy rendering effect is obtained after a series\nof interactions via our approach, it is a natural requirement\nto save or share high resolution results with others. In our\nframework, this function can be implemented conveniently\nby rendering from the ELDI data within an additional\nMapReduce pass on the cloud Figure 1 shows two high res-\nolution \(rendered at resolution of 20480×15360 and resized\ninto 4000×3000 directly rendered from ELDI.\nB. Discussion\nTile size for ELDI is very important, it affects the par-\nallelism in both the back-end rasterization and the front-\nend rendering, also the reuse of the rendering results So\nin order to get a optimized tile size, we experiment with\ndifferent tile sizes and different net for the results conditions\nto compare average response time, see Table VI. In our\ntesting environment, local mode means a LAN with a band\nwidth of 100Mbps and remote mode means a WAN with a\nband width of 4Mbps. We ?nd that a tile size of 256×256\ncan obtain a good balance between the size of data that need\nto be transferred and overhead come along with the increase\nof the number of tiles. And for the small resolutions \(e.g.\n640×480 1280×960 smaller\nin order to achieve better parallelism in rasterization. See\nTable II for the tile size of each level.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nThis paper leverage MapReduce for parallel rasterization\nand ?nally constructed a rendering system that aims at\nlarge-scale meshes in combine with web techniques. The\npurpose of rasterization is to make the data suitable for\nthe rendering service, as well as control the size of the\ndata and make it acceptable. We use pixel for intermediate\nrepresentation, pixels are split into tiles in image space, and\nat each position in image space, pixels are sorted by their\ndepth. Such a strategy can ful?ll the two purpose mentioned\nearlier. Firstly, storing pixel’s information such as normal,\nuv and depth can make it easy and exible to provide all\nkinds of render effects \(lighting, texture mapping representation grows only linearly with the\ndepth complexity of the mesh, which means it can be well\ncontrolled.\nThe current approach only allows user view models from\nconstrained view directions. As a future work, it is easy\nto extend our approach by processing more view directions\nand using the interpolation 


method proposed in [19] to\nachieve arbitrary viewing. Another problem with the current\napproach is that the size of ELDI representation is tightly\nconnected to its resolution. When the resolution get higher,\nthe size get larger. This will limit the highest resolution that\nthe system can achieve. A promising solution is to render\ndirectly based on triangles in extremely high resolution\nlevel or the number of triangles inside the screen under a\nthreshold, that will enable user to browse complex models\nat arbitrary resolutions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China \(Grant No. 61070073 Grant No. 2012AA12090 and the key Natural\nScience Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China \(Grant No.\nLZ12F02002  Dean and S.

FFT SNR \nFigure 18 gives the frequency residual of the carrier during \nthe vehicle banking after Entry.   The frequency excursion at \n5:23:26 UTC is an erroneous data point resulting from the \npower loss caused by the switch from the PLGA to the \nTLGA. \n \nFigure 18 – Example of Real-time RSR Frequency \nResidual \nFigure 19 Figure 20, and Figure 21 are the result of post-\nprocessing of the RSR data.   Figure 19 shows the frequency nsignature of 2 rpm caused by the MSL spin-stabilized cruise \nstage.   Figure 20 gives the carrier signal-to-noise and \nresidual frequency during the Approach, Entry, Descent, \nand Landing Phase.  Key events are inscribed in the figure.  \nFinally Figure 21 lists the carrier signal-to-noise and \nresidual frequency at the time of parachute deploy.  The \nparachute deploy event is clearly seen to occur at 5:28:54 \nUTC.  \n nFigure 19 – MSL EDL X-Band DSS-43 Signal-to-Noise \nRatio and Residual Frequency – Spacecraft Spin  \n \n \n11 nFigure 20 – MSL EDL X-Band DSS-43 Signal-to-Noise \nRatio and Residual Frequency during the last 20 \nminutes \n n \nFigure 21 – MSL EDL X-Band DSS-43 Signal-to-Noise \nRatio and Residual Frequency at Parachute Deploy \n6 CONCLUSIONS \nMany of the critical events occurring during the newly \ndeveloped MSL EDL sequence have been detected by \nexamination of the transmitted X-band carrier signal \ntransmitted during EDL.  In particular, we have shown that \nby correlating the received power and frequency of the X-\nband signal accurate evaluation of the spacecraft spin, entry, \nantenna sequence, parachute deploy can be made.  The use \nof the RSR combined with FFT signal processing \ntechniques has been shown to be effective in determining \nspacecraft critical information from MPF to MER to the \nhighly dynamic MSL entry.  The hardware and signal \nprocessing techniques are simple and effective and will \ncontinue to allow effective sleuthing of spacecraft status for \nthe next generation of Deep Space Missions. \n7.

Conclusions The SHOTPUT mission , its unique trajectory and potential encounter with six different small bodies will provide a novel view of the composition of the solar system. The science return from the mission will help answer questions on formation, composition and evolution of small bodies in our local neighborhood In addition, the team has proposed a mission that is within budget based on heritage instruments satisfying the decadal survey requirements. The opportunity for spectacular science return on this rare trajectory should not be missed The innovative SHOTPUT mission is truly one of a kind Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Anita Sohus, Amber Norton and JPL Team X for their contributions to this work.

Available Array Energy 60297 W-hr Battery Recharge Energy Losses 93 W-hr Shunt Energy Losses 20% Battery W-hr 187 W-hr Remaining Electrical Energy 60017 W-hr Power Conversion Losses 80% Efficiency 12003 W-hr Harness Losses \(4 Available Diurnal Load Energy \(CBE Average Load Energy Supported 67.9 W Array Area 0.20 m2 12 specifically the seismometer and magnetometer continuously while other instruments such as the heat flow probes may operate intermittently. The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
