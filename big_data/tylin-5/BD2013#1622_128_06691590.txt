INTRODUCTION\nDetecting complex event patterns from multiple highly\nuncertain data streams is a promising vehicle to support\nBig Data applications for monitoring detection, and online\nresponse [4], [9]. Consider, for example, an urban monitoring\nsystem that identi?es road congestions and responds by\napplying local changes to traf?c light control policies to\nreduce ripple effects Such a system may use events that\nreport on the ?ow in junctions together with reports from\nbuses to collect evidence of congestions in-the-make.\nTwo of the main challenges when dealing with Big Data\nare that of variety and veracity. Data, arriving from multiple\nheterogeneous sources, may be of poor quality and in general\nrequires pre-processing and cleaning when used for analytics\nand query answering. In particular sensor networks introduce\nuncertainty into the system due to reasons that range from\ninaccurate measurements through network local failures to\nunexpected interference of mediators. While the ?rst two\nreasons are well recorded in the literature, the latter is\na new phenomenon that stems from the combination of\nvariety and sensor data. Sensor data may go through multiple\nmediators en route to our systems. Such mediators apply\nvarious ?ltering and aggregation mechanisms, most of which\nare unknown to the system that receives the data. Hence, the\nuncertainty that is inherent to sensor data is multiplied by\nthe factor of unknown aggregation and ?ltering treatments.\nIn this work we outline the principle of using variety\nto effectively handle veracity. In a nutshell, streams from\nmultiple sources are used to generate common complex\nevents These events are matched against each other to\nidentify mismatches that indicate uncertainty regarding the\nevent streams. Temporal regions of uncertainty are identi?ed\nfrom which point the monitoring system autonomously\ndecides on how to manage this uncertainty. At times,\ncomplete event intervals are neglected. At other times, a\nselection mechanisms prefers one stream over the others.\nFinally, using multiple sources, one can create a distribution\nover the possible occurrence of events in inconsistent regions.\nOur tool of choice for this task is the RTEC \(Run-Time\nEvent Calculus  event algebra operators, RTEC has a built-\nin representation of the law of inertia [7] that makes it\nparticularly useful for expressing rules that dynamically\ndiscard noisy event sources and include reliable ones.\nWe illustrate our approach using real, heterogeneous data\nstreams concerning city transport and traf?c management.\nFirst, we use data from Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traf?c\nSystem \(SCATS sensors mounted on\nintersections to measure traf?c ?ow. Second, we use bus\nprobe data stating, among others the location, line and delay\nof each bus as well as traf?c congestions. The voluminous\ndata streams come from the city of Dublin, Ireland, and\nconcern all SCATS sensors of the city and the complete\nbus ?eet. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ?rst\napproach combining these heterogeneous streams for real-\ntime intelligent transport management.\nThe contributions of the paper are summarized as follows:\n• At a conceptual level, we show how cross-validating\nmultiple data streams can be used for self-adaptive event\nprocessing that enhances stream credibility.\n• We show how the use of semantics can support reasoning\nfor such cross-validation.\n• We provide empirical evidence to the feasibility of the\nproposed approach.\nOrganisation.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nEvent 


processing refers to an approach to software systems\nthat is based on event delivery, and that includes speci?c logic\nto ?lter, transform, or detect patterns in events as they occur.\nEvent processing platforms are diversi?ed into products with\nvarious approaches towards event processing, including the\nstream oriented approach, the rule oriented approach, the\nimperative approach, and the publish-subscribe approach. As\na common denominator, all of these approaches assume that\nall relevant events are consumed by the event processing\nsystem, all events reported to the system have occurred, and\nevent processing can be done in a deterministic fashion.\nEtzion and Niblett [4] discuss the roots of uncertainty in an\nevent-based system and present several approaches to handle\nit. Gal et al. [5] model uncertainty in data steams and survey\ntechniques to manage it, focusing on uncertainty of rules.\nGenerally speaking, there may be four different approaches to\ndeal with event uncertainty. First, uncertainty can simply be\nignored. Such a solution may be cost-effective if uncertainty\nis relatively infrequent, and the damage of not handling it is\nnot substantial A second approach requires complex events\nto be recognized only when the event pattern is a necessary\nand suf?cient condition to deterministic detection. Most event\nprocessing systems follow these two approaches that is, they\ndo not manage uncertainty [3].\nAccording to a third approach, it is possible to notify\nthe result of detected events, along with an indication \(such\nas probability approach\nare based on probabilistic graphical models [13], Markov\nLogic Networks [12], probabilistic logic programming [11],\nand fuzzy set and possibility theory [8]. Although there\nis considerable work on optimising probabilistic reasoning\ntechniques, the imposed overhead does not allow for real-time\nperformance in a wide range of applications [1].\nFinally, event recognition can be designed so that it makes\nuse of reinforcement from multiple indications. Our work\nfalls into this category, in which multiple sources are used\nfor cross-validation. Due to volume and velocity, cleaning\nthe data in advance \(see, for example, [6 always\nfeasible, while common uncertainty elimination techniques,\nsuch as load shedding based on con?dence are in most cases\nineffective [1].\nThese last two approaches are orthogonal and systems may\nuse one or both approaches. While our proposed method\nfalls under the fourth approach, its outcome can be used to\nsupport other approaches as well. For example, by identifying\ntemporal regions of inconsistency, one can establish an\nempirical probability distribution over the event streams.\nAlso, discarding inconsistent streams effectively creates a\ndeterministic dataset, as is promoted by the second approach.\nIII. A LOGIC-BASED EVENT MODEL\nWe present a logic-based event processing model based on\nthe Event Calculus for Run-Time reasoning RTEC   and their effects. Based\non [2], we summarise the essentials of the model. We adopt\nthe common logic programming convention that variables\nstart with upper-case letters \(and are universally quanti?ed,\nunless otherwise indicated logic\nprogramming due to the formal, declarative semantics and\nthe rich expressiveness it offers. RTEC supports ef?cient\nreasoning \(as is evident in the empirical evaluation illustrating the approach feasibility.\nA. Event Representation\nSystems for event recognition \(event pattern matching [9 SDE or low-level event coming from a sensor [10]. Events\nthat arrive at the system are not the raw events emitted by\nsensors. Such raw events are enriched, ?ltered, and aggregated\nby multiple mediators, whose internal functionalities may\nnot be known to the event recognition system. As indicated\nabove, such preprocessing may result in uncertainty as to the\nvalidity of the events, and the use of multiple event streams\nfor cross-validation is at the heart of our proposed solution.\nUsing SDE as input, event recognition systems identify\ncomposite events \(CE interest — collections of events that\nsatisfy some pattern. The speci?cation of a CE \(or high-level\nevent imposes temporal and, possibly, atemporal constraints\non its deriving events, either SDEs or other CEs.\nIn the RTEC model, types of events are represented as\nn-ary predicates event\(Attribute1,. . . ,AttributeN that\nthe parameters de?ne the attribute values of an event instance\nevent\(value1,. . . ,valueN from the Dublin traf?c\nmanagement scenario is the type of SDE emitted by SCATS\nsensors, traf?c\(StreetSegId Flow, Count identi?ed by the attribute StreetSegId with constant values, e.g., traf?c\(s187, 4.51, 117 by\ninteger time-points. The occurrence of an event E at time\nT is modelled by the two-ary predicate happensAt\(E, T is allowed to have different values\nat different points in time. Here, the term F =V denotes\nthat ?uent F has value V . Informally, holdsAt\(F =V, T

Run-Time Composite Event Recognition\nBased on the introduced model, run-time CE recognition is\nperformed as follows. The RTEC engine queries, computes\nand stores the maximal intervals of uents and the time-\npoints in which events occur. CE recognition takes place\nat speci?ed query times Q1, Q2 At each query time\nQi only the SDEs that fall within a speci?ed interval —\nthe ‘working memory’ \(WM or ‘window’ — are taken into\nconsideration: all SDEs that took place before or on Qi?WM\nare discarded. This constraint ensures that the cost of CE\nrecognition depends only on the size of WM and not on\nthe complete SDE history. The size of WM, as well as the\ntemporal distance between two consecutive query times —\nthe ‘step Qi?Qi?1 relationships between WM and Qi?Qi?1 can be\ndivided into three cases, as follows.\n• WM < Qi?Qi?1, that is, WM is smaller than the step.\nIn this case, the effects of the SDE that took place in\n\(Qi?1, Qi?WM] will be lost.\n• WM = Qi?Qi?1. In this case, no information will be\nlost, provided that all SDEs arrive at the engine in a\ntimely manner. If SDEs do not arrive in a timely manner,\nthen the effects of SDEs that took place before Qi but\narrived after Qi will be lost.\n• WM > Qi?Qi?1. In the common case that SDEs arrive\nat the engine with delays, it is preferable to make WM\nlonger than the step. This way, it becomes possible to\ncompute, at Qi, the effects of SDE that took place in\n\(Qi?WM, Qi?1], but arrived after Qi?1.\nFurther details on RTEC may be found in [2].\nIV. EVENT RECOGNITION FOR TRANSPORT & TRAFFIC\nMANAGEMENT\nThe model presented above is used for city transport and\ntraf?c management in the city of Dublin. We ?rst describe the\ninput event streams of the different sources \(Section IV-A Streams\nTo guide transport and traf?c management, the input to the\nevent recognition engine consists of SDE that come from two\nheterogeneous data streams with different time granularity.\nFirst, static sensors mounted on various junctions \(SCATS\nsensors number of vehicles passing over. In\naddition, buses transmit information about their position and\ncongestions every 20-30 sec. Buses transmit SDEs with the\nfollowing structures:\nhappensAt\(move\(Bus,Line,Operator ,Delay T gps\(Bus,Lon,Lat ,Direction,Congestion Bus,Line,Operator ,Delay event where\nBus runs in Line with a Delay at time T \(in micro-\nseconds pos-\nsibly negative integer measured in seconds.

In this section we focus on traf?c congestion.\nInformation on congestion is reported in both input streams,\nSCATS sensors and buses. Consider ?rst congestion as\nreported by SCATS sensors:\nholdsFor\(scatsReportedCongestion\(LonS ,LatS true, I ow\(LonS ,LatS aggregateCount\(LonS ,LatS all\([I1, I2], I 2 LonS ,LatS LonS ,LatS ow and aggregate\nnumber of vehicles passing over the SCATS sensor at location\n\(LonS ,LatS low/average/high. Whether the traf?c ?ow\nand aggregate count is low \(respectively average/high sensor depends on the capacity of the road\nin which the sensor is installed. intersect all computes the\nintersection of a list of lists of maximal intervals — see\nTable I for the interval manipulation constructs of RTEC.\nAccording to rule \(2 LonS ,LatS of a SCATS sensor if the traf?c\n?ow and the aggregate number of vehicles passing through\nthat location are low.\nThe congestion de?nition presented above is suf?cient for\nthe given SDE, as these are de?ned in the SCATS dataset.\nAlternative congestion de?nitions from ?xed sensors are\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\nCongestion is also reported by buses — this is very useful\nas there are numerous areas in the city that do not have\nSCATS sensors. Consider the following formalisation:\ninitiatedAt\(busReportedCongestion\(Lon,Lat nhappensAt\(move\(Bus gps\(Bus,LonB ,LatB , , 1 LonB ,LatB Lon,Lat busReportedCongestion\(Lon,Lat move\(Bus  gps\(Bus,LonB ,LatB , , 0 LonB ,LatB ,Lon,Lat 3 Lon,Lat some area of interest, while\n\(LonB ,LatB event, is given by the dataset.\nclose is an atemporal predicate computing the distance\nbetween two points and comparing them against a threshold.\nbusReportedCongestion\(Lon,Lat the location \(Lon,Lat the bus congestion \(represented by 1 in the gps ?uent Lon,Lat when\na \(possibly different Lon,Lat represented by 0 in gps incomplete and erroneous SDE\nstreams [1]. Not surprisingly, the bus and SCATS datasets on\nwhich we perform CE recognition are no exception. Various\nSDE ?elds are incomplete or incorrect and sensors provide\ncon?icting information. Due to the signi?cant overhead of\nprobabilistic reasoning, uncertainty is often ignored see\nSection II self-adaptive CE\nrecognition that deals with some types of noise without using\nprobabilistic reasoning techniques. Consequently, we may\nimprove accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.\nOur methodology is simple. It involves representing noise\nas CE, using the same mechanism that aims at detecting CE\npatterns to tell us whether our detection contains embedded\nuncertainty. By doing so, we can gain from the ef?cient\nmechanisms that were developed for event processing to\nrecognize and manage uncertainty. Next, we provide several\ninstances to this methodology.\nWe look into types of noise that are known in advance,\neither via machine learning or expert knowledge. For example,\nit is known that SCATS sensors that are close to each\nother often report con?icting traf?c ?ow values, which we\ninterpret as uncertainty due to the sensor proximity. We model\nsuch a noise type as a CE, and upon detection we adapt\nthe CE recognition process by temporarily s noise:\nholdsFor\(sensorFlowNoise\(S1 ,S2 owTrend\(S1  owTrend\(S2 I1, I2], I3 owTrend\(S1 I4 owTrend\(S2 I4, I5], I6 I3, I6], I 4 partial de?nition of the ?owTrend ?uent was given\nin rule \(1 lists of maximal intervals \(see Table I S1 ,S2 sensors S1 and S2 have con?icting traf?c ?ow\nvalues, that is, the ?ow value in S1 is increasing re-\nspectively decreasing in-\ncreasing which\nsensorFlowNoise\(S1 ,S2 other.\nIn Dublin three sensors are often placed close to each\nother, all reporting on a speci?c junction. In case one of\nthese sensors contradicts the others, the former may be\ntemporarily discarded from the CE recognition process. An\nimplementation of this idea leads to a variant of rule \(2 congestion by means of SCATS sensors:\nholdsFor\(scatsReportedCongestion\(LonS ,LatS

According to rule \(2 consideration in the detection of a\ncongestion as long as S has a con?icting ?ow trend with its\nnear-by SCATS sensors.\nWe also identify the conditions in which a bus provides\npotentially noisy information in order to adapt the CE recog-\nnition process by \(temporarily idea is implemented as\nfollows \(‘not’ denotes negation-by-failure noisy\(Bus nhappensAt\(move\(Bus gps\(Bus,LonB ,LatB , , 1 LonB ,LatB ,LonS ,LatS holdsAt\(scatsReportedCongestion\(LonS ,LatS noisy\(Bus nhappensAt\(move\(Bus gps\(Bus,LonB ,LatB , , 1 LonB ,LatB ,LonS ,LatS  scatsReportedCongestion\(LonS ,LatS noisy\(Bus nhappensAt\(move\(Bus gps\(Bus,LonB ,LatB , , 0 LonB ,LatB ,LonS ,LatS holdsAt\(scatsReportedCongestion\(LonS ,LatS 5 congestions\nif a SCATS sensor contradicts it, assuming here that SCATS\nsensors are more trustworthy than buses.

The number of such CEs is proportional to the\nnumber of event sources. In most applications, this means\nthat there will only be a small increase in the number of\nCEs being recognised. In the following section we evaluate\nthe execution overhead on the city of Dublin.\nVI. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION\nExperimental Setup. Our experiments were performed\non real data streams coming from the buses and SCATS\nsensors of Dublin, Ireland. The streams were collected from\nFebruary 1 to April 30 in 2012 and comprise 13GB of\ndata. The bus dataset includes 942 buses and 91 lines/routes.\nEach operating bus emits SDEs every 20-30 seconds with\ninformation about its position, delay and congestions. On\naverage, the bus dataset has a new SDE every 2 seconds. The\nSCATS dataset includes 966 sensors. Each SCATS sensor\ntransmits information every six minutes and reports on traf?c\n?ow and aggregate number of vehicles passing over the\nsensor. Excerpts from both datasets are publicly available1.\n1http://www.dublinked.ie\n323\n01\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n10 min =  \n12,5K SDE\n30 min =  \n40,5K SDE\n50 min =  \n67K SDE\n70 min =  \n94,5K SDE\n90 min =  \n124K SDE\n110 min =  \n152K SDE\nTi\nm\ne \n\(s\nec\n and self-adaptive CE recognition in a single processor.\nWe recognise CEs concerning individual bus punctuality,\nline punctuality \(the maximal intervals for which a line\nconsisting of a number of buses is said to be punctual trends in any\nlocation of interest in Dublin is contradicted by near-by SCATS sensors,\nand the maximal intervals for which a bus is contradicted\nby a SCATS sensor on congestion.\nThe experiments were run on a computer with eight Intel i7\n950@3.07GHz processors and 12GB RAM, running Ubuntu\nLinux 12.04 and YAP Prolog 6.2.2.\nResults. We ?rst compare two sets of experiments In\nthe ?rst, we performed ‘static’ recognition, that is, CE\nrecognition that always takes into consideration all event\nsources. In this case, at each query time RTEC computes and\nstores the maximal intervals of around 51,000 CEs. Then,\nwe performed self-adaptive event recognition where noisy\nsensors are detected at run-time 


and the system autonomously\ndiscards them until they resume offering reliable information.\nIn this case, RTEC computes and stores the maximal intervals\nof 53,500 CEs with a 5% increase in the number of CEs\ncompared to the static setting. Figure 1 displays the average\nCE recognition times in CPU seconds. The working memory\n\(WM ranges from 10 min, including on average 12,500 SDEs,\nto 110 minutes, including 152,000 SDEs. CE recognition\nwas performed on a single processor.\nFigure 1 shows that self-adaptive CE recognition has\na minimal overhead compared to static recognition. The\noverhead is due to computing and storing the maximal\nintervals of additional CEs, capturing the intervals for which\nsome sensors are considered unreliable.\nFigure 1 also shows that RTEC performs real-time CE\nrecognition both in the static and the self-adaptive setting.\nFor example, in a 10 min WM both static and self-adaptive\nrecognition take on average around 1 sec, while in a 110\nmin WM recognition takes on average around 9 sec.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n10 min n12,5K SDE\n30 min =  \n40,5K SDE\n50 min =  \n67K SDE\n70 min =  \n94,5K SDE\n90 min =  \n124K SDE\n110 min =  \n152K SDE\nTi\nm\ne \n\(s\nec\n and self-adaptive CE recognition in 4 processors.\nCE recognition performance is not entirely dependent on\nthe size of the input data streams. The complexity of the\nCE de?nitions affects signi?cantly recognition times. In this\nwork we make use of quite complex CE de?nitions including\nvarious constraints on multiple entities \(buses running on\nthe same line, for example majority of the event processing\nliterature where quite simple CE de?nitions are used.\nCE recognition for transport and traf?c management, as\nde?ned here, is straightforward to distribute. In Dublin, for\ninstance SCATS sensors are placed into the intersections of\nfour geographical areas: central city, north city, west city, and\nsouth city. We distributed CE recognition accordingly. We\nused four processors of the computer on which we performed\nthe experiments — each processor computed CEs concerning\nthe SCATS sensors of one of the four areas of Dublin as\nwell as CE concerning the buses that go through that area.\nFigure 2 shows the average CE recognition times for\nthe static and the self-adaptive settings. We see that the\nperformance difference between static and self-adaptive CE\nrecognition is smaller than before. This is due to the fact\nthat, in each processor, the difference in the number of CEs\nbetween the static and the self-adaptive setting is smaller as\neach processor computes CEs concerning a smaller number\nof event sources. For example, the processor responsible for\nthe largest geographical area of Dublin computes and stores\nthe maximal intervals of 18,000 CEs in the static setting and\n19000 CEs in the self-adaptive setting. In other words, in\ndistributed self-adaptive CE recognition the intervals of at\nmost 1,000 additional CEs are computed while in centralised,\nself-adaptive recognition we compute the intervals of 2,500\nadditional CEs.\nDistributing CE recognition to four processors lead to\nsigni?cant performance gain. The input to each processor is\nrestricted to the SDEs of the SCATS sensors and buses for\nwhich it performs CE recognition. Furthermore, as mentioned\nabove, each processor has to compute and store the maximal\n324\n02\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n180K SDE 194K SDE 208K SDE 222K SDE 236K SDE 250K SDE\nTi\nm\ne \n\(s\nec\n Event Recognition\nFigure 3. Static and self-adaptive CE recognition in 4 processors: high\nvelocity data streams.\nintervals of a smaller number of CEs. One may further\ndistribute CE recognition by dividing further the geographical\narea of the city under consideration, thus reducing CE\nrecognition times.\nTo test our approach on higher velocity data streams, we\nincreased further the WM size. Figure 3 shows the average\nCE recognition times when WM ranges from 180,000 SDEs\nto 250,000 SDE. In these experiments four processors were\nused in parallel. As shown in Figure 3, the performance of\nself-adaptive CE recognition is very close to that of static\nrecognition even in larger data streams. Therefore, we can\nconclude that data velocity has only minor impact on the\nperformance overhead of self-adaptation.\nVII. SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK\nTwo of the main challenges when dealing with Big Data\nare those of variety and veracity. We presented the principle\nof using variety to effectively handle veracity. Streams from\nmultiple sources are used to generate common composite\nevents. These events are matched against each other to\nidentify mismatches that indicate uncertainty regarding the\nevent streams. Temporal regions of uncertainty are identi?ed\nfrom which the system autonomously decides to adapt its\nevent sources in order to deal with uncertainty, without\ncompromising ef?ciency. At times, complete event intervals\nare neglected. At other times, a selection mechanisms prefers\none stream, or an entity within a stream, over the others.\nOur approach is generic and applicable to any event\nprocessing application in which noise types can be determined\nvia expert knowledge or machine learning techniques For\nillustration purposes, we used real, heterogeneous data\nstreams from SCATS sensors and buses in Dublin. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the ?rst approach combining\nthese heterogeneous streams for real-time intelligent transport\nmanagement. Our experiments show that self-adaptive event\nrecognition compromises ef?ciency only very slightly, and\ntherefore, is a promising approach to dealing with veracity\nin Big Data 


applications.\nFor future work, we intend to explore the increase in\naccuracy achieved by self-adaptive event recognition. In the\nINSIGHT project2, we are collecting datasets for which\nground truth is available \(for instance, by means of tweets\nsent to the radio station reporting on congestions and quality\nof transport this way, we will be able to perform a\nbalanced comparison with probabilistic reasoning approaches.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by the EU INSIGHT project\n\(FP7-ICT 318225 IDEAS NGHCS project.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

Schiff \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Towards Model-Based Control in Neural Engineering \n \nAbstract: Since the 1950s, we have developed mature theories of modern control the-\nory and computational neuroscience with little interaction between these disciplines. \nWith the advent of computationally efficient nonlinear Kalman filtering techniques n\(developed in robotics and weather prediction increasingly accurate reconstruction of dynamics in a variety \nnormal and disease states in the brain, the prospects for synergistic interaction between these fields are \nnow strong. I will show recent examples of the use of nonlinear control theory for the assimilation and con-\ntrol of single neuron and network dynamics, a control framework for Parkinson’s disease, and the potential \nfor unification in control of spreading depression and seizures. Lastly, I will discuss why the subtle and \ndeep intersection of symmetry, in brains and models, is important to take into account in this transdisci-\nplinary fusion of computational models of the computational brain with real time control.  \n Biographical Sketch: Steven J.

That has necessitated the challenge of con-\ntrolling the limb with such superior dexterity.  I will introduce methods for dexterous nprosthesis control, from myoelectric to cortical \(EEG, Electrocorticogram, neural \nspike, local field potential incorporating multimodal sensors, such as camera and video tracking, may lead to more functional \nand practical prosthesis control.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
