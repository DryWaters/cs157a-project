This method however is likely suffered \nfrom memory effect, for it will cause the algorithm failure \nwhen facing the big data appliances This problem can be \nsolved through massively parallel approaches. But on the other \nhand, the complex architecture of the current massively \nparallel machine environment leads to the more difficulty in \nthe implementation of algorithms with adaptability and \nparallel scalability. Caused by the dual complexity of ncomputing environments and software architecture, the \ndevelopment difficulty of high-performance algorithms is \nrapidly rising from now on.

INTRODUCTION \nThree dimensional numerical simulations are \napproximate computing procedures for solving complex \nphysical processes. The actual physical model is usually \ncontained multiple temporal and spatial scales, multi-\nphysical field, and high resolution features. Therefore the \noutput will be made of a series of data set which reflected the \ncomplex physical processes. Thus each spatial grid node in \nsuch datasets usually contains a large of physical property \nvalues, resulting in the huge data to be analyzed These \ncomplex and practical applications will present huge \nchallenge to the data visualization and visual analysis. \nBecause it is difficult to visual analysis such a massive \ndata sets, efficient parallel visualization methods need to be \nstudied to help domain experts accurately get the important \nphysical knowledge and the phenomenon behind the huge \ndata. In practice, the GPU-accelerated volume ray casting nmethod proved to be a reliable method. It brings many \nconveniences to three-dimensional numerical simulation: \n• A powerful data representation can restore the \nsimulated physical processes and the physical nmodels with high accuracy. It can not only help \nresearchers to understand the overview of the data \nmodel but also to make it easy to observe the details \nof local data; \n• The data probe capability is defined by the user-\ndefined transfer function for exchanging the \nrendering attributes for different physical variables nThe researchers can then easily filter the \nmeaningless information or the spatial data they do \nnot care about. Then the three dimensional data \nstructure and the inherent relationship between \nphysical quantities can be more clearly and visually \nshowed with color and depth transparency.  \n• Hardware acceleration ability can significantly \nimprove the interactive rendering performance of the \nvolume rendering method. Through the real-time \nrotation, zoom and shift operation, researchers can \nunderstand a variety of information behind the data. \nBut GPU-accelerated volume rendering method is limited \nby GPU memory. It is easy to cause the algorithm failure \nwhen facing the large scale data sets. This problem can be \nsolved through massively parallel approaches. On the other \nhand, the complex architecture of the massively parallel \nmachine environment leads it became more difficult to \nimplement the algorithms with adaptability and parallel nscalability. So we need to study the parallel rendering \ntechniques used for seamless connecting between the low-\nlevel complex computing environments and the high-level \nvisualization software. Finally, they can be stable and \nefficient support executing of GPU accelerated volume \nrendering algorithms. \nIn this paper, we propose a distributed multi-\nnode GPU accelerated parallel volume rendering scheme for \ninteractive visual analysis of the terabyte scale datasets. This \nframework support high-precision GPU ray casting volume nrendering algorithm, and it can be further extended to the \nmulti-GPU parallel rendering method based on the GPU \ncluster environment. When utilizing 8 multi-node GPU, \nexperiments show that the volume rendering scheme this \npaper proposed can provide the interactively rendering \nability and high image quality when dealing with 17GB \n2013 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Visualization\n978-0-7695-5150-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/ICVRV.2013.32\n153\nsingle time-step scientific data. The final volume rendering \nperformance is less than 1 second per frame. This result is \none order of magnitude faster than the traditional parallel ray \ncasting method that running on 512 processor cores. \nII. RELATED WORK \nVolume rendering is an important method for \nvisualization of three-dimensional data field, because it can \nvisually represent the physical phenomena inside the data. It \ndoesn’t need construct intermediate geometry, but directly \ngenerate images 


from the three-dimensional data. To meet \nthe needs of visualizing large-scale three-dimensional data, \nthe parallel volume rendering algorithm is presented [1]. \nSince 2008, the Lawrence Livermore national laboratory in \nthe U.S. has show that their scientists have successfully \nprocessed ten billion scale scientific data with volume \nrendering methods by using tens of thousands of processor \ncores on supercomputer [2]. The amount of data they can \nhandle in one time-step is close to 100 GB. The researches of \nparallel visualization algorithm based on GPU cluster [3] \nshow that the U.S. scientists have also developed the high \nperformance GPU volume render that can handle large-scale \ndata greater than 100 GB in a single time-step take advantage nof 256 GPU in 128 cluster nodes. \nOver the last decade, many academic groups in China \nhave also conducted research that represented by the volume \nrendering algorithm. These include: multi-resolution \nvisualization techniques [4], out-of-core Visualization \ntechnology [5], feature-based visualization method [6] and so \non In the research area of GPU-accelerated volume \nrendering, the team in Zhejiang University realized the 3D-\ntexture based parallel volume rendering of 3 GB visible \nHuman Dataset in the U.S. digital image library 7]. The \nrendering performance had reached 2 seconds per frame. In \ntheir experiments, the cluster that is used consisted 16 nodes, \neach node is equipped with an Nvidia 5950 GPU. Hunan \nUniversity had performed the volume rendering of 1.3 GB \nSeismic data in single PC that is equipped with Intel Core2 \nDuo CPU and Nvidia Gefore 8800 GTS [8]. \nOur study employed the Visit visualization tool [9], \nwhich is capable of rendering data in parallel and distributed \ncomputing environments. VisIt is a large and complex \ncontract based system because it employs a modified data \nflow network design. In the VisIt’s low-level architecture, \nthe base data flow network system is similar to the \nimplement of VTK. Many data flow network components of \nVisIt perform pipeline operation by using VTK modules. So \nin order to implement our rendering scheme, we need to \nmake a great of changes in the whole VisIt system. \nIII. PARALLEL RENDERING ARCHITECTURE \nWe implemented our multi-node GPU accelerated \nparallel rendering scheme inside VisIt, which is capable of \nvisualizing and analyzing the results of terabyte scale \nscientific simulations. The system is hardware independent, \nwhile still providing graphics at the speed of the native \ngraphics hardware. The render can operate in client/server \nmode so that scientists can run the user interface on the local \ndesktop machine while running the VisIt compute engine in \nparallel on a powerful remote computer. This lets VisIt \nexploit the speed of the local desktop's graphics hardware \nwhile still getting parallel performance. Furthermore, this \nmeans that the user doesn’t have to move their dataset to a \nvisualization server. \nA. The Parallel Rendering Pipeline \nThe parallel rendering pipeline use data-parallel \nrendering mechanism to solve the memory bottleneck caused \nby large-scale datasets. The main idea is using data blocking \nstrategy to implement data parallel, and take advantage of the \nsort-last parallel rendering model to achieve parallel \nrendering. In blocking technology the whole dataset is \ndivided into several small pieces of data. Each data block \nsize will not exceed the upper bound of GPU texture \nmemory. During the rendering stage, each data block is \nmoved from main memory into GPU memory by order for \nfinishing the rendering. For sort-last rendering model, the \nfirst stage is assigning several blocks of data to multi-\nprocessors, and then each processor is coupled to a GPU to \nfinish geometry and rasterization processing, each processor \nwill therefore generate a full-size image of the local data. In \nthe last stage, all images will be composited on by the order \nof space and depth to generate the final image results. The \npipeline is described in Fig. 1. \nIn the VisIt visualization pipeline, the three key stages \nused for performing the sort-last parallel volume rendering \nare the data resampling, parallel volume rendering and the \nparallel image compositing. So the single frame rendering of \nVisIt not only includes the traditional rendering and \ncompositing time, but also includes the data resampling time. \nThe new render implemented for our scheme will be \nintroduced in section 4. The following content in this article \nwill focus on the data resampling and load balancing. \nB. Data Resampling \nVisIt’s GPU accelerated volume rendering algorithm \nonly can handle two types of grid data including uniform \nand rectilinear grid. Therefore, in order to handle other data \nwith different grid types, VisIt pipeline need to adaptively \nadjust those grid data which not suitable for volume \nrendering algorithm before the volume render starts. This \n \nFigure 1.  The parallel rendering architecture \n154\nprocess is called the data resampling. The resulting output \nof data resampling is still the grid data. \nIn the volume rendering algorithms also exist a ray \nresampling procedure but it aims to calculate the color and \nopacity of a ray on a certain position in space, and the color \nand opacity are then used for the sampling points \ncompositing along that ray. The resulting output of ray nresampling is the color and opacity value on one ray \nposition. \nC. Load Balancing \nIn parallel volume rendering, the load balance strategy on \ndata sampling is a very important impact factor. For it not \nonly affects the performance of resampling procedure, but \nalso had a large influence on the following parallel rendering \nprocess. Load balancing involves two main load factors, they \nare data distribution and data block 


size. The Load balancing \nstrategy used in VisIt’s parallel rendering pipeline is the \nimage based spatial distribution method. Each processor is \nresponsible for one part of the whole screen. The spatial ndistribution corresponding to current partial screen can be \nused to determine which grid cell is being handled by the \nprocessor responsible for rendering the current partial screen. \nBut the non-uniform spatial distribution in unstructured \ngrid always caused the unbalance work load in processors. \nDuring the rasterization stage, the increasing small blocks of \ndata will improve the performance of rasterization nExperiences always show that a data collection which mixed \nwith a large number of small-block and a few numbers of \nlarge blocks will cause unbalance in each computing node. \nVisIt’s load balance method is an adaptive strategy. It \nfirst uses the static load distribution, each processor is \nresponsible for a part of the image screen area, and each \nprocessor is assigned with many of the multi-block data sets. \nFor each processor, a coefficient of the image raster number \nis calculated. These coefficients are important factor used to \nbalance the load assignments of data resampling in the image \nscreen area corresponding to each processor latterly. The \nVisIt’s load balancer will assessment the work load of ray \nresampling in volume rendering stage combined with the \ncoefficients of data resampling for each processor, and then \nmore evenly distributed load task across all the processors. \nThese can be used to realize the load balancing between nresampling and volume rendering. \nIV. DISTRIBUTED MULTI-NODE GPU ACCELERATED \nPARALLEL RENDERING SCHEME \nFor interactive visual analysis terabyte-scale or even \nlarger-scale data sets, the VisIt parallel visualization software \nneed to match with the complex cluster environment \ncoupling of multi-core CPU and GPUs. Because of the dual \ncomplexity of computing environments and software \narchitecture, two development aspects of requirements to the \nVisIt software are proposed. First, the high performance \nGPU rendering algorithm suitable for underlying hardware \nneeds to be developed. Second, the parallel rendering \nscheme needs to be studied that used for seamless connection \nbetween the low-level complex computing environments and \nthe high-level VisIt software. Together they can support the \nGPU rendering algorithm for the stable and efficient nexecution.  \nIn this paper, we propose a multi-node GPU accelerated \nparallel volume rendering scheme that contains a GPU ray-\ncasting render and the corresponding parallel rendering \nscheme. Take advantage of them VisIt can provide high \nimage quality and highly interactive visual analysis \ncapabilities for large-scale data based on high-performance \nhardware environments. \nThe diagram of our parallel rendering scheme for VisIt nsoftware is shown in Fig. 2, which mainly included: \(i ii iii orderly multi-\npass rendering, \(iv implemented the GPU ray casting volume \nrender in the current version of VisIt software. This GPU \nalgorithm is proposed by Kruger in [10]. The compositing of \ncolor and opacity in sampling point are two of the most nintensive workloads. The rapid growth of these computations \nis proportional to the image resolution and sampling rate of \nthe ray. So the main task of the algorithm is how to \naccelerate the ray sampling and the color and opacity \ncompositing by GPU hardware. \nDuring each rendering stage, the ray-casting render will nrendering a cube where the colors represent coordinates in \ncurrent eye direction, and the OpenGL’s interpolation will \nautomatically generate the spatial coordinates for all pixels in \nthe image screen. The front and the backside of the cube are \nrespectively rendered at the same times. The data ranges of \nall pixel coordinates are normalized to the range [0, 1]. They \nthen represent the all the entry position and exit position \nalong the ray in the current view direction. By subtracting \nthe back face from the front face, a direction vector for each \nFigure 2.  Parallel rendering scheme \n155\npixel can be calculated. This is the direction of eye ray. Each \ntime the user interacts with the visualization image, these \ncubes will be redraw again, and therefore the direction of the \neye ray will always be updated. \n The two cube images are saved in the two-dimensional \ntexture format and then be uploaded into the GPU texture \nmemory as the initial conditions for the GPU computing. \nOnce the ray is created, then it will step through the volume \ntexture to perform the GPU Ray casting. During this period, \nthe texture registers in GPU core are responsible for ninterpolating the volume coordinates by using the sampling \npoints, specifically the interpolation operation is quickly \nimplemented by the GPU texture addressing parts. The color \nand opacity compositing are calculated by the logic unit of \nGPU stream processors. The GPU rendering code is \nimplemented in the GLSL \(OpenGL Shading Language control the GPU pipeline. \nThe rendering result comparison of CT-Head data is \nshown in Fig. 3. The image rendered by GPU ray casting \nmethod \(Fig. 3 b the image generated by GPU 3D-texture \nmethod \(Fig. 3 a contrast between the two images. The rendering \nquality of the GPU ray casting method is much better than \nGPU 3D-texture method. Fig. 4 shows that there are little \ndifferences between GPU method and CPU method based on 


nray-casting. Both of them can clearly describe the material \ninterface inside the rendered image. \nB Off-Screen Rendering \nIn the OpenGL rendering pipeline, the geometry data and \ntextures are transformed and passed several tests, and then \nfinally rendered onto a screen as 2D pixels. The final \nrendering in the OpenGL pipeline is called framebuffer. \nFramebuffer is a collection of 2D arrays or storages used by \nOpenGL color buffers, depth buffer, stencil buffer and \naccumulation buffer. By default, OpenGL uses the \nframebuffer as a rendering destination that is created and \nmanaged entirely by the window environment.  \nWhen rendering is performed a scene in local machine, \nthe contents of the framebuffer can directly displayed to the \nscreen after the "refresh" command is called by \nOpenGL. However, when the engine of VisIt is deployed in \nsuch parallel distributed visualization environment, the \nrendering will perform in server-client mode. The render nengines of VisIt will generate multiple windows across \nmultiple cluster nodes for managing the framebuffer in each \nnode. In this case, only partial images are saved in the \nframebuffer of each node. Therefore, all cluster nodes cannot \nuse the traditional "refreshing" approach because of the \npartial images will then be directly shown into the user \nscreen. Rather than directly refresh, the local image will be \nread from the framebuffer into the main memory at each \nnode in VisIt for the image compositing purpose. But all the \nnode’s window will be displayed on the remote computer \nscreen at the same time during this process, then easily cause \nthe image disorder because the framebuffer is disturbed by \nthe overlapping windows. \nOff-screen rendering can be used to overcome the \ndisturbance problem in framebuffer. In accord with the off-\nscreen mechanisms, all the nodes generate a logical buffer \nand control the OpenGL pipeline to fill rendering results ndirectly into these logical buffers. The OpenGL extension, \nGL_ARB_framebuffer_object provides an interface to \n \(a b 3D-texture \nand ray-casting method \n \n \n \(a b comparison of volume renders between GPU and \nCPU based ray-casting method \n156\ncreate additional non-displayable framebuffer objects \n\(FBO order to distinguish from the default \nwindow- provided framebuffer. By using framebuffer object \n\(FBO OpenGL application can redirect the rendering \noutput to the application-created framebuffer object \(FBO nexcept the traditional framebuffer. The FBO is more \nefficient during the rendering context switching for it saves \nunnecessary data copies and memory consumption. \nWe implement the off-screen scheme at two separate nlevels in VisIt’s visualization pipeline. The first level is the \nunderlying VTK window management, which is used to take \nover the OpenGL rendering pipeline output, so that the high-\nlevel rendering algorithm can be executed in the window-\nindependent mode. The second level is our GPU ray-casting \nvolume rendering algorithm the off-screen rendering is not \nonly used for reliable implementing the algorithm, but also \ncan improve the data transmission performance between \nGPU texture memory and the logical framebuffer. The data \ntransmission is mainly accelerated by the render-to-texture \nmechanism. \nC. Render To Texture \nRender-to-texture \(RTT handful method to create a \nvariety of effects. When it is attached with an FBO, the \ntexture memory can used as the rendering destinations of \nOpenGL pipeline directly. In this way, high-level software \ncan directly manipulate the texture memory rather than \ntransferring data with time-consuming copy-to-texture \n\(CTT mechanism. Render-to-texture is a traditional way \nthat draw a scene to the framebuffer as normal, and then ncopy the framebuffer image to a texture by using \nglCopyTexSubImage2D rendering the scene \nto a texture. Sometimes, high-level software or algorithm \nneeds to generate dynamic textures on the fly. For GPU ray \ncasting volume rendering algorithm, the user interaction will \nfrequently trigger the switching of three off-screen texture \nbuffers. The first two textures are used to store the entry npoint coordinates and exit point coordinates from the eye to \nvolume. Both of them are the intermediate results after \nOpenGL clipping rendering. The third texture act as the off-\nscreen framebuffer. Each interactive time during the GPU \nray casting, these texture buffers need to be updated \nimmediately. Hybrid rendering using render-to-texture and \nFBO, we can eliminate an additional data copy \(from \nframebuffer to texture any image storage \(buffer texture FBO. These logical buffers in FBO are 2D \narrays of pixels that can be attached to a framebuffer object. \nIf an image of a texture object is attached to a framebuffer, \nOpenGL performs render to texture. Except performance \ngain, there is another advantage of using render-to-texture \nwith the FBO. If the texture resolution is larger than the size \nof the rendering window without FBO, then the area out of \nthe window region will be clipped. But FBO does not suffer \nfrom this clipping problem. So the high-level software can noff-screen render a texture larger than the display window. \nD. Orderly Multi-Pass Rendering \nIn the VisIt the requirements of hybrid rendering with \nmulti-plots are often presented. When utilizing the geometry 


nelements based rendering algorithm, such as iso-surface \nrendering, OpenGL rendering pipeline can be conveniently \nachieve the mix rendering of the multiply plots with the \ndepth order hidden algorithm. So the different multi-plots \norder in VisIt’s pipeline will not affect the uniqueness of the \nhybrid rendering results. \nHowever, volume rendering results may be translucent. \nThen hybrid rendering can no longer simply rely on the \ndepth order hidden algorithm. Therefore it requires \nspecial care on a transparency blend operation to perform \nthe correct rendering. Based on the classic painter's \nalgorithm, blending operations of image A over image B \ncan be defined as follows: \nOC = AC + BC \(1- A 1 represents the image A, and BC represents \nthe image B. A?  is the transparency of the image A, and \nOC representing the composite image results. It can be seen \nthat different image blending order can lead to different \nimage results. So when the hybrid rendering contains \nvolume rendering plot, the render sequence between the \nopaque and translucent image should be orderly. \nTo implement the correctly hybrid rendering for our GPU \nray-casting volume render in the VisIt, we present the \norderly multi-pass rendering mechanism, as shown in Fig. 5, \nwhich is modified based on the VisIt visualization pipeline. \n First the strategy will filter all the VisIt plot objects \nready for rendering in the pipeline. Then all the plot objects \nidentified as opaque have been set the priority to run in the \nfirst pass. The translucent plot objects such as GPU ray-\ncasting volume rendering can be executed subsequently until \nthe first pass rendering of all the opaque plots is finished. \nThe opaque image generated at the first pass is used as a \nbackground image in the second pass rendering. For GPU \nray-casting volume rendering, the algorithm will coupling \ndepth detection and blend operation to get the final correct \nimage results. \nFigure 5.  Orderly multi-pass rendering \n157\nE Multi-Buffering Switching \nIn the traditional way without GPU ray-casting, OpenGL \npipeline handle the pixel mixing directly by the pixel \noperations, for example, depth detection. Before each new \nrendering result is written into the frame buffer, OpenGL \nwill perform the pixel operation by using the old image \nstored in the frame buffer and current new image. The \ntraditional hybrid rendering is directly operated with \ngeometry elements, such as iso-surface rendering. So the \nframebuffer is always valid during the whole rendering npipeline, therefore ensuring the correctness of the hybrid \nrendering. \nBut the hybrid rendering with GPU ray-casting in VisIt \nusually cause the conflicts of framebuffer. Due to the off-\nscreen rendering mechanism the framebuffer need to switch \nto FBO object frequently at an interactive rendering time. \nEspecially in the orderly multi-pass rendering process, the \nfirst pass is opaque plot rendering, which require the \npipeline redirect the rendering output to the default system-\nframebuffer. Otherwise it will not get the correct image nrendering result. But in the second pass, GPU ray-casting \nneed direct the rendering output to the off-screen frambuffer \nobject \(FBO second pass rendering, \nand then can be restored after the second pass rendering is \nfinished. \nThe implement of multi-buffering scheme includes three \nlayers in VisIt architecture. As shown in Fig. 6, the lower-\nlayer is lying in VTK context where we implement FBO \nframe buffer object for supporting off-screen rendering. The nmiddle-layer is the VisWindow object in VisIt’s rendering \npipeline. Some buffer-control actions of multi-buffering \nscheme are added in VisWindow object. The GPU ray-\ncasting volume render is the high-layer where the specific \ncache operations are performed. There is additional control-\nlayer in the NetworkManager object in which the entire \nmulti-buffering process is controlled. \nV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nTo test the performance of our distributed multi-\nnode GPU accelerated parallel volume rendering scheme for \nthe proposed in this paper, a large scale numerical datasets \nhave used. The dataset is generated in a simulation program nof laser filament, the grid resolutions of this dataset ares \n1024×1024×2048, and the dataset contains 200 time steps \nand the size of a single time-step with single physical \nvariable can reach 17 GB. The algorithm test environment is \na visualization cluster equipped with an NVIDIA Quadro \nFX 5800 graphics card at each node where the video \nmemory is 4 GB. The rendering result can be seen in Fig. 7. \nTo compare the algorithm performance, we need to select \nthe volume rendering algorithms with same high image \nquality in VisIt software. In present version of VIsIt, only \nthe CPU based ray-casting volume rendering has the same \nimage quality. So we focused on the comparison between \nMulti-CPU based and multi-GPU based parallel ray-casting nvolume rendering algorithm in this work.  \nThe algorithm tests are performed between the multi-core \nCPU and multi-GPU based visualization method. The \nsampling rate and rendering image resolution, and other test nparameters of plotted are using the same settings. \n With the support of multi-node GPU accelerated parallel nvolume rendering scheme, GPU ray-casting in VisIt \nsoftware can be scaled to use 8 computing nodes \(including n8 GPU time-step \nscientific data in less than 1 second per frame. \nFigure 6.  The architecture of multi-buffered switching  \nFigure 7.  Multi-node GPU accelerated parallel volume rendering with 17 \nGB data\n158\n By 


contrast, when using the multi-CPU based parallel \nvolume rendering, the rendering performance is still more nthan 10 seconds per frame even when VisIt is scaled to use \n512 processor cores. Our multi-node GPU accelerated \nparallel volume rendering scheme have shown an obvious \nadvantages for the interactive visualization capabilities \ntoward large scale data sets.  The detail algorithm \nperformance can be seen in Table 1. \n Based on the supporting of orderly multi-pass rendering \nmechanism in our scheme, the GPU-accelerated volume  \nrendering algorithm can perform the complex hybrid \nrendering task of multi-plots in VisIt. For example, Fig. 8 \nshows the temperature distributing of the ocean current data \nin climate model simulation, Fig. 8 \(c nTo perform multi-plots hybrid rendering, VisIt need to \ncorrectly calculate the occlusion and perform blending \noperations for multiple spatial object. Take advantage of the \norderly multi-pass rendering mechanism presented in this \npaper, the hybrid rendering can accurately determine the \nmixed rendering sequences and iso-surface positions for the \nGPU ray-casting render. Fig. 8 shows the multi-pass \nrendering of climate model simulation data sets.    \nFig. 9 shows the changing of proportion between image \nrendering and image compositing over the time. Analysis \nshows that, with the scaling of the degree of parallelism, \nimage compositing time has a faster relative growth than \nimage rendering. This is caused by the fact that the VisIt nparallel rendering pipeline does not provide efficient parallel \nalgorithms for the image compositing, such as the binary-\nswap algorithm. So the compositing process is only \nimplemented by the collective communication with MPI. \nThe problem with the compositing strategy is that many \nprocessors will be idled during the communication process, \nand hence result in the bad parallel scalability of the \nalgorithm. Unless the algorithm can keep all processors \nalways be busy, otherwise the costs of image compositing \nwill finally exceed the volume rendering with the increasing \nparallel scale, and finally become the dominant factor of nparallel rendering performance. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nThis paper introduces the distributed multi-\nnode GPU accelerated parallel volume rendering scheme for  \nparallel and distributed computing environment with \nGPU hardware. Based on the rendering mechanism and \nmethod in the scheme, the parallel visualization algorithm nhas the capability of hardware-accelerated rendering on the \nvisualization cluster which each node coupled multi-core \nCPU and GPU. When the parallel scale is increased to 8 \nGPU, the results show that our scheme can rendering the \n17GB datasets in less than 1 second per frame, which \nenhanced the interactive visualization analysis capabilities. \nTABLE 1.

The most certain of\nall design assumptions is that data arrives in a host of file\nformats and directory hierarchies with poorly-documented\nnaming conventions due to collection urgency.\nTraditional servers use highly specialized data bases, file\nstructures, and disk racks Once data is in the system and\nprocessed and structured appropriately, there is no peer for\nrapid delivery But, to the extent that servers require time-\nconsuming import/copy/processing prior to dissemination,\nthe server itself becomes the barrier.\nFast-Earth meets the mission need, once a new drive is\nattached to the server, by scanning for imagery, using a\ntree algorithm assuming arbitrary directory hierarchies then\nupdating the rapid index. Data can then immediately be\naccessed by phones.\nData center interfaces\nData center interfaces consist of five components: file system,\nGDAL meta-data drivers, a rapid index, and access and\nsearch interfaces. Images are stored in the disk drive file\nsystem instead of a database. GDAL provides the ability to\nread image files. The Access and Search Interface provides\nalgorithms that use the tables to look up a series of available\nimagery given a geographical coordinate of interest. Other\ncomponents are described in more detail below.\nMeta-data drivers are heuristic algorithms that access file\nmetadata in GeoTiff tags. We noticed that time-tag metadata\nnames varied by survey team, and probably require software\nstandardization. Correct time tags are important for first\nresponders. For example, consider a responder conducting\na neighborhood evacuation given two plat images at different\ntimes, one with a car and people, and the other without. Time\norder enables the responder to determine whether people have\npreviously evacuated, or new people have entered the danger\nzone and may require warning.\nThis algorithm creates indexes from arbitrary disk stores\nto allow search by location.. The Rapid Index is for the\nimages in the stores, not the plats in the cache. Rapid Ingest\nuses a recursive algorithm to scan across all disk stores and\ndirectories. Our initial implementation created a two level\nindex: a master index and a series of sub indexes, one for each\ndirectory on the disk. Preliminary measurements showed an\nindexing rate of 10 minutes per terabyte.\nSubsequently we researched and experimented with an im-\n6\nFast Earth  \nCoordinate System nConverters \nW\neb\n H\nTT\nP \n S\ner\nvi\nce\ns \nR00 R01 R100 \n. . . \nImage Chipper \nCache Repositories : Data Metadata \nFast Responder \nWireless \nMobile App \nAccess & \nSearch \nInterface \nManaging System Control Logic nImage \nData \nPlat \nAccess \nServices \nFi\nle\n S\nys\nte\nm\n  S\ner\nvi\nce\ns \nCache Ingest \n“Datacenter” \nImage \nData nImage \nData \nSensors Datacenter Fast-Earth Comms Mobile  User \nHard Problem: \n“The last 400 feet” \nGDAL nRapid \nIndex \nMeta-data \nDrivers \nCache Access \nUser \nAuthentication \nInterface Fast Earth Server “Cache Datacenter” \nFast Responder \nWired Network \n“App” \nInterface \nImage \nData Rapid Ingest \nFigure 8.

This is the most innovative and\ncritical algorithm in the system, based on reverse asymmetric\nparallel processing concepts.\nTraditional remote sensing servers store data by collection\nrecord. When a request is received for a geographic location,\na database searches all records to find matches. The time-\nliness challenge is that response time is proportional to the\nproduct of records and simultaneous users. The traditional\nsolutions apply faster servers, disks, and parallel processors.\nWith mobile computing, challenges are amplified. The\nmobile-server relationship is asymmetric [28 in that whereas\nmost client-server algorithms assume a desktop client with\nwall power, mobile phones have small batteries. Servers must\nconserve client power by offloading computations [57].\nFast-Earth uses a non-intuitive high-performance approach:\nparallel search on client phones. This is an impossible\noperation 


with traditional servers because only the servers\ncan track the growing number of records in the database,\nso clients wait while they search. However, with Fast-Earth\nbecause the earth and plats are fixed in size, the total number\nof plat caches is fixed. Thus simple algorithms convert a\nlatitude,longitude pair to a plat ID and run efficiently on\nphones. In reverse asymmetry, “searches” are performed on\nclient phones in parallel each contacting the server directly\nwith the record ID, increasing service speed.\nThus the approach and motivation behind Section 3 is to se-\nlect plat size, to fix total number of records, to enable creation\nof efficient search algorithms, to offload computations to the\nphones in parallel, to increase responsiveness of the server, to\nincrease timely data dissemination to mobile users.\nThe Image Chipper, given a plat ID searches for images\nwithin the plat cache, chips out plat pages, and converts them\nto JPEG using ImageMagick 58].\nThe Cache Repositories hold the global cache. A large\nserver would have thousands of repositories distributed across\nnumerous disks. We simulated 100 repositories, each respon-\nsible for 30 million plats.\nWeb Services and Applications\nFig. 8 shows web services on the right. The web server\naccepts HTTP requests using a session-less interface. We es-\ntimate our prototype could support 100+ simultaneous users.\nApplications shown in Fig. 8 include both the Fast-Responder\nwireless mobile app for iPhone [1], and the Fast-Responder\nnetwork app as a command center desktop widget.\n6. PERFORMANCE RESULTS\nWe tested the prototype server using up to three iPhones\nand an iPad tablet simultaneously with a mobile hot spot.\nNational Guard volunteers experimented with the apps and\nprovided feedback. One case of interest was the capability to\nuse the iPhone 4S to access Fast-Earth and wirelessly transmit\nthe interactive display to a battery-operated micro-projector\nprojecting a small screen on the wall.\nUsing a 3G wireless link with an iPhone 4 or 4S, it is possible\nto select and download a handful of images at a plat within\nseconds. The process of starting the app, using GPS to select\na location, chipping and transmitting an index from the server,\nselecting images for download, and flickering between two or\nmore images, can be accomplished in less than a minute.\nAs an anecdote, after weeks of Fast-Responder experimenta-\ntion by many people, testing in numerous locations, viewing\nwhat we considered large amounts of data, we were surprised\nto discover the cache contained only about 80 MB of imagery,\na small fraction of our terabytes of data.\nWhile this may not be representative of a real disaster sce-\nnario it reminds us of experiments in human vision and gaze\n7\ncontrol [59]. It is well known in human vision studies that\nthe human visual cognitive system, in assessing a new scene,\ndoes not spend an equal amount of time on every pixel.\nInstead, the eye rapidly focuses attention on key parts of a\nscene. It seems possible that in real use the number of plats\naccessed may be much smaller than expected.\nTraditional remote sensor assumptions may be flawed in how\ndata is packaged and delivered. Image data compression is\nused on the assumption that all parts of a large image are\nequally valuable because there is no simple way to determine\nwhich parts are actually used. Because Fast-Earth provides\nfocus, data volumes may be dramatically reduced.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nThe Fast-Earth prototype feasibly answers the call to incorpo-\nrate more remote sensing into emergency management 21]\nby using earth quantization to rapidly disseminate data to\nemergency responder smartphones [1]. This architecture can\naugment existing servers during a disaster.\nThe challenge of getting data to mobile responders requires\ntransformative ideas and technologies from the research com-\nmunity. One transformative vision comes from Basole [60]\nwho conceived a framework for enterprise mobilization and\ntransformation. His process starts with a mobile adoption\ndecisions and leads through a series of stages to new core\ncompetencies These ideas may suggest ways to create other\nnew emergency response competencies that benefit victims,\nresponders, and decision-makers alike.\nIdeas for future Fast-Earth research include the following.\nImage Registration—Proper registration is a continuing crit-\nical need in disaster response [24 Automatic registration\nalgorithms [61] employed prior to chipping may improve user\nsituation awareness User-submitted ground control points\nmay also help. If a responder flickers through a series of\nimages, and some are mis-registered, it may be confusing.\nImage Processing—Image processing techniques can be used\nto create a many data layers on the fly for each plat. These\nlayers could focus attention on key scene features such as\nman-made regions \(MMR RBL  unique uses\nfor image processing products.\nMulti-sensor Fusion— Many opportunities exist for sensor\nfusion in disaster response [62]. For example, after an\nearthquake, besides structural damage and rubble, the next\nmost significant danger is fire [63]. Many remote sensing\ntechniques have been developed for global fire monitoring\nas part of climate analysis [64] [65] [66]. These techniques\ncould be adapted to automated processing and fused with\nrubble information to assist earthquake responders.\nTime Trending—Because Fast-Earth accumulates time-series\nsensor data in plat caches, adaptations of existing algorithms\n[67] could automatically create trend products. Some respon-\nders may lack time to flicker through a series of images but\nvalue a single picture of trended nearby hazardous activity.\nData Compression—Fast-Earth is a data 


compression method\nthat clips out image parts not of primary interest. Traditional\ndata compression variations could be explored in a responder\ncontext. For example, some man-made disasters such as\nchemical spills are hazardous to responders but may not\nbe detectable from simple imagery. Hyperspectral sensors\ncould potentially warn responders, but have data volumes\ntoo high for transmission to a phone. Years of research has\nbeen devoted to hyperspectral data compression [68] but data\nvolumes are still too high for mobile computing.\nIn summary, earth quantization provides a novel way to\npartition the earth and opens a new horizon for rapid wide\nscale dissemination of large amounts of remote sensing data\nat near real-time rates. The Fast-Earth geospatially-organized\ncache and server based on the earth quantization concept has\npotential to transform future remote sensing dissemination\nand image processing capabilities.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.

In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
