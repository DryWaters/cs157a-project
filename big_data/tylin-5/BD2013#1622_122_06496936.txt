This step typically involves\nthe identification of a set of candidate architectures and a cost-\nbenefit analysis to compare them Computational tools have\nbeen used in the past to bring rigor and consistency into this\nprocess. These tools can automatically generate architectures\nby enumerating different combinations of decisions and options.\nThey can also evaluate these architectures by applying cost\nmodels and simplified performance models.\nCurrent performance models are purely quantitative tools that\nare best fit for the evaluation of the technical performance of a\nmission design. However, assessing the relative merit of a system\narchitecture is a much more holistic task than evaluating the\nperformance of a mission design. Indeed, the merit of a sys-\ntem architecture comes from satisfying a variety of stakeholder\nneeds, some of which are easy to quantify, and some of which\nare harder to quantify \(e.g., elegance, scientific value, political\nrobustness, flexibility Moreover, assessing the merit of a system\narchitecture at these very early stages of design often requires\ndealing with a mix of: a information. Current computational\ntools are poorly suited for these purposes.\nIn this paper, we propose a general methodology that can be\nused to assess the relative merit of several candidate system\narchitectures under the presence of objective, subjective, quan-\ntitative, and qualitative stakeholder needs. The methodology\nis called VASSAR \(Value ASsessment for System Architectures\nusing Rules assumption of the VASSAR\nmethodology is that the merit of a system architecture can be\nassessed by comparing the capabilities of the architecture with\nthe stakeholder requirements. Hence for example, a candidate\narchitecture that fully satisfies all critical stakeholder require-\nments is a good architecture The assessment process is thus\nfundamentally seen as a pattern matching process where capa-\nbilities match requirements, which motivates the use of rule-\nbased expert systems \(RBES VASSAR\nmethodology and shows how it can be applied to a large complex\nspace system, namely an Earth observation satellite system.\nCompanion papers show its applicability to the NASA space\ncommunications and navigation program and the joint NOAA-\nDoD NPOESS program.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1 INTRODUCTION 1\n2 VALUE ASSESSMENT OF SYSTEM ARCHITEC-\nTURES USING RULES VASSAR 11\n4 CONCLUSION 16\nAPPENDICES 17\n978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 c©2013 IEEE.\n1 IEEEAC Paper #2255, Version 4, Updated 01/05/2013.\nA INSTRUMENT CHARACTERISTICS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\nB STAKEHOLDER REQUIREMENTS 17\nC COST MODEL . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS 20\nREFERENCES 20\nBIOGRAPHY 21\n1. INTRODUCTION\nSystem Architecting\nSystem architecting is by definition the process by which\na system architecture is defined. Crawley defines a system\narchitecture as an abstract description of the entities of a sys-\ntem and the relationships between those entities [1]. Hence,\na system architecture can be seen as the set of high-level\nearly system design decisions. These decisions are impor-\ntant because they will define most of the system’s lifecycle\nproperties, and its ability to sustainably provide value to the\nstakeholders.\nThemes in System Architecting\nThere are several recurring themes in system archictecting\nthat are of relevance to this paper, namely: complexity,\nemergence, and the value delivery loop.\nComplexity and Emergence— Many definitions of system\ncomplexity exist that can appear to be quite different in nature\n\(compare for example, [1] and [2 However, most authors\nidentify two major sources of system complexity:\n1 the degree to which\nthese parts are interconnected or coupled.\n2 unpredictability on the\nsystem’s behavior, that is sometimes labeled as “non-linear\ndynamics”. Due to this uncertainty, the behavior of a certain\nsystem cannot be explained by simple combination of the\nbehavior of its parts. Note that the latter statement usually\nappears in definitions of the word “system”.\nRegardless of the definition, architecting complex systems\nrequires a means of dealing with these two aspects namely\nrepresenting \(and computing with a form\ndecomposition of a system can be represented using a 3-level\ntree, in which the root tree is the system; the system is divided\nin subsystems; and each subsystem consists of components.\nModeling emergence can 


be done for example by means of\nsimulation, or simple logical rules: “if I can run, I can swim,\nand I can cycle, I can participate in a triathlon”.\n1\nThe Value Delivery Loop—One of the key characteristics of\nsystem architecting is that it strives to maximize stakeholder\nvalue, rather than just economic profit or performance. Value\nis often defined as benefit at cost, where benefit goes be-\nyond traditional performance measurements, and includes the\nsatisfaction of both technical and non-technical stakeholder\nrequirements Hence, a good architecture is one that is\ncapable of sustainable value delivery to the stakeholders over\nits lifecycle.\nThe value delivery loop is a path from the system’s ele-\nments of function and form to the value delivered to the\nstakeholders. A simplified view of the loop starts with\nthe system which decomposes into a set of subsystems and\ncomponents. These components perform functions at certain\nlevels of performance, thus satisfying the needs of different\nstakeholders. Overall, the value delivery loop goes from the\nsystem’s form domain, to its function domain, to stakeholder\nsatisfaction.\nRole of Computational Tools in System Architecting\nMuch of the work in the field of systems architecting has\nbeen qualitative in nature, describing principles, methods,\nand tools that can be applied to architect a system. Examples\nof this are references collecting “principles” of good system\narchitecting \([3], [4 system archi-\ntecting purposes in many organizations. These tools typically\nfocus on describing a complex system architecture, i.e., they\nfocus on the first aspect mentioned in the previous section\n\([5], [6 major role is to help communicate a certain\nsystem architecture.\nA subset of these tools incorporate a simulation layer on top\nof the descriptive layer. These tools are executable and allow\nsimulation of the system’s behavior in different operational\nscenarios \([7], [8 identified earlier: modeling emergent behavior.\nRelatively little effort has been put on the development of\nquantitative tools tailored to optimize a system architecture,\nor equivalently, to explore the tradespace of possible system\narchitectures. The terms architectural tradespace exploration\nand architecture optimization are used as synonyms in this\npaper, and designate the global effort to identify preferred\nsystem architectures, study the relative importance of and the\ncoupling between decisions, and more generally, gain insight\nabout the shape of the architecture trade space \(i.e., localize\ninteresting and uninteresting regions compute sensitivities of\nfigures of merit to decisions, and so forth tradespace exploration\nperform three main functions:\n\(1 a\nmathematical model \(usually a graph of allowed\noptions.\n\(2 merit.\n\(3 several likely reasons as to why little has been\npublished on these tools, mostly related to perceived simi-\nlarities with design optimization tools, increased uncertainty\nand ambiguity with respect to other design optimization prob-\nlems, and often increased difficulty to solve the optimization\nproblem.\nHowever these tools are important because they can support\nthe system architect by bringing rigor and exhaustiveness to\nthe architecting process, where most of the system’s lifecycle\ncost is committed. This paper outlines a methodology to\ndesign a key part of these tools: the module evaluating a\nsystem architecture. Due to the particularities of system\narchitecting with respect to system design \(mixed use of sub-\njective and objective information, mixed use of quantitative\nand qualitative information, high uncertainty and ambiguity,\ncomplex value delivery loop namely\nrule-based expert systems this\nchoice are outlined in the following sections.\nValue Assessment of System Architectures\nThe evaluation function of a tradespace exploration tools re-\nquires a way of quantifying the value of a system architecture\nthrough the use of objective functions that capture the needs\nand requirements of stakeholders Objective functions in\nsystem architecting are often called value functions. Cre-\nating a set of value functions can be challenging because\nsome aspects of the value definition may be subjective or\nhard to quantify, e.g., “the value of a scientific discovery”, or\n“the engagement of the youth”. Indeed, evaluating a system\narchitecture requires dealing simultaneously with quantitative\nand qualitative knowledge.\nThis section reviews the state-of-the-art of the literature con-\ncerning formal methods to estimate the sometimes subjective\nvalue of a system architecture. Some may argue that this is\nan attempt to “quantify the unquantifiable”. In reality, the\nsystem architect still has to make architectural decisions even\nin the presence of ambiguity and subjectivity, and therefore\nwe argue that there is value in developing formal methods to\nhelp them make these important decisions.\nSince the field of system architecture is reduced related\nbodies of research were reviewed. In particular, we found\nthat this problem is similar in some aspects to the problems\nof assessing the worth of a financial endeavor, the value of\na new policy or public good, and the technical performance\nof a system, and therefore we reviewed strategies from eco-\nnomics, policy, and 


science and engineering.\nValue Assessment in Science and Engineering— The most\ncommon approach to assess the value of an engineering\nsystem \(e.g. a satellite mission end-to-end simulation models simu-\nlate everything from the externally delivered function of the\nsystem to its supporting functions and its interaction with\nthe surrounding context at a sufficient level of detail that it\npermits calculation of system performance. This approach is\ntypically used in most science and engineering projects \(e.g.,\n[9 provides cardinally meaningful\nscores, and is objective.\nA different simulation-based approach to value assessment in\nscience is the use of Observing System Simulation Exper-\niments or OSSEs. OSSEs are used to quantify the value of\na certain dataset, typically in Numerical Weather Prediction\n\(NWP forward model simulates the\nstate of the weather system \(nature run dataset by computing the difference in\n2\nforecasting performance between the whole system with and\nwithout the dataset [10]. OSSEs are extensively used in NWP\nbecause of their fidelity and objectiveness. However, they\nare extremely computationally expensive, and they are only\napplicable to a particular class of systems, namely systems\nthat produce a dataset that is used in a forecasting process.\nEnd-to-end simulation models and OSSEs are objective tools\nthat are not designed to deal with subjective value. Subjective\nvalue in science is often assessed by conducting expert sur-\nveys. An example of this is NASA’s Science Value Matrices\n\(SVMs 11].\nSubjective value of engineering products can be assessed\nusing customer input. An instance of tool that falls under\nthis category is the House of Quality [12], in which users\nrate the importance of different customer attributes, while ex-\npert engineers rate the coupling between customer attributes\nand design features. The Analytic Hierarchy Process[13] is\nanother formal methodology to elicit relative preferences In\nthe presence of more than one metric, multi-attribute utility\ntheory [14] is used to combine multiple utility functions to\ncreate a single metric. This combination is possible under a\ncertain set of assumptions.\nValue Assessment in Business Management—The canonical\ntool to assess the value of a project in business management is\nto compute its Net Present Value \(NPV time-discounted using a certain discount\nrate r: NPV =\n?\ni\n\(bi?ci 1+r providing a cardinal ranking of\narchitectures, i.e., differences in dollars between the values\nof two architectures are meaningful. The main disadvantage\nof this approach is that some systems are less amenable to\nmonetization. For example, it is hard to monetize the value\nof science, or the inspiration of the youth two examples\nused before to illustrate the concept of subjectivity in system\narchitecting. There is also some controversy about the choice\nof adequate discount rates, and even the adequacy of the\nconcept of discount rates for valuation of certain projects,\nespecially projects funded by taxpayer money [15].\nThe use of NPV described in the previous paragraph does\nnot include uncertainty. One way of introducing uncertainty\nis to construct a decision tree where the NPVs of each\nproject under a set of plausible scenarios are calculated Each\nscenario is then assigned a certain probability of occurrence,\nand the expected NPV \(E[NPV as the average\nof the NPVs in each scenario weighted by the probability of\noccurrence of the scenarios.\nFinally, in cases where the product delivered by the system\nis information, its value can be computed as the ?E[NPV ]\nbetween a case where the information is available, and the\nreference case where it is not available. Information provides\nvalue by updating the probabilities of each scenario, thus\nleading to an increase inE[NPV ]. Although the information\nalso has a cost, this cost may be offset by the ?E[NPV ].\nThis approach is called the value-of-information approach\n\(VoI to\nclimate datasets [16].\nValue Assessment of Public Goods—Government organiza-\ntions often deal with projects whose value cannot be easily\nmonetized, or even whose value is subjective. In this case, the\ntypical source of information for project valuation is expert or\nstakeholder judgment, i.e., directly surveying the experts or\nthe stakeholders. Expert opinion is elicited through question-\nnaires and then quantified using scoring rubrics, Likert-based\nscales, utility theory, or other formal processes such as the\ncontingent valuation method [17], [18].\nDecision trees and VoI can also be applied with utility in-\nstead of currency. Hence, the metrics for these methods\nbecome expected utilityE[u] or the ?E[u] between the cases\nwith and without the information. For example, Nordhaus\napplied the utility-based VoI approach to assign a value to\na certain climate satellite dataset. The dataset reduces the\nuncertainty in key climate parameters such as the sensitivity\nof global temperature to atmospheric CO2 concentration,\nthus allowing for a more accurate forecasting of increases in\ntemperature and consequently, a more efficient climate policy\ndesign [16].\nThe advantage of expert judgment based approaches is that\nthey are easy to apply, and they can deal with subjective infor-\nmation. The main disadvantage is that most researchers agree\nthat these methods can only provide an ordinal ranking of\narchitectures, and therefore differences in utility between ar-\nchitectures are 


not meaningful \(only the ordering is required in some cases, so that the knowledge elicitation\nprocess can actually become the bottleneck of the architecting\nprocess.\nClassification of valuation strategies—In this subsection we\ndiscuss insight gained from the survey of approaches de-\nscribed in the previous subsections. We start by providing\na classification of valuation approaches according to two\ncriteria: the units in which benefit is expressed, and the role\nof the system being assessed.\nStrategies to approach this problem can be classified accord-\ning to their computation of value, and the unit in which value\nis expressed. We distinguish between three main strategies:\na profit \(dollars physical units utility\n\(utils them: value is profit in\nbusiness management; value is performance in science and\nengineering; value is utility in public policy.\nAn alternative classification of strategies can be done accord-\ning to the role of the system being assessed. We distinguish\nbetween direct and indirect strategies. In direct strategies,\nthe value of the system is the value directly delivered by\nthe system to the stakeholders. The system takes thus a\nprimary role in the value delivery process. Examples of direct\nmethods are the NPV approach or end-to-end simulation\nmodels.\nIn indirect or delta strategies, the system provides value by\nbeing a part of, or a complement to, a larger system. The\nsystem takes thus a secondary role in the value delivery\nprocess. In this case, the value of the architecture is computed\nas the marginal \(or delta primary\nsystem provides to the stakeholders when the system being\nassessed is implemented. Examples of indirect methods are\nthe VoI approach and OSSEs.\nApplication to System Architecting— This section has pre-\nsented several approaches commonly used to assess the value\nof a system architecture. While all of these approaches could\ntheoretically be applied to system architecting, there is an\nimplicit hierarchy in the use of these approaches that stems\n3\nTable 1. Classification of value assessment methods\naccording to units of benefit and role of system\nBenefit is\nprofit utils NPV,\nE[NPV ]\nEnd-to-end\nsimulation\nUtility theory,\nSVM,\ncontingent\nvaluation,\nHoQ\nIndirect ?NPV ,\n?E[NPV nOSSE ?u\nfrom their advantages and disadvantages. This hierarchy\nis illustrated in Figure 1, which provides insight into how\nto choose a valuation approach depending on the system\narchitecting problem at hand.\nMonetary approaches are used with top priority when appli-\ncable because they are objective and clear to communicate.\nNPV is the most commonly used option for systems that\nhave a relatively clear market value, such as communications\nsatellites. This approach has been advocated by industry, with\nthe creation of institutions such as the Value-Driven Design\nInstitute, and it was recently applied for example to the case\nof fractionated spacecraft [19].\nWhen monetization is not possible, performance-based\nmethods, both direct \(end-to-end simulation OSSEs For example, end-to-end simulation\nmodels are created for every Earth observation satellite mis-\nsion at the European Space Agency, and OSSEs have been\napplied to a variety of ESA and NASA satellite missions [20].\nIf benefit cannot be objectively calculated, or if it is too ex-\npensive to apply simulation-based methods subjective meth-\nods such as expert judgment or value-of-information can be\nused. For example, Ross and Hastings use MAUT in [14],\nand NASA uses SVMs for the assessment of their science\nand exploration missions 11]. Note that, in practice, since\nsubjective metrics appear almost systematically in the system\narchitecting process of many space science and exploration\nprojects, expert judgment is a necessary component in an all-\npurpose system architecting tool. This is in opposition to\na typical system design tool, which will use only objective\ninformation.\nRule-based Expert Systems\nA rule-based expert system \(RBES uses\na large number of logical rules, i.e., if-then structures, in\norder to solve complex problems. These rules capture the\nexpert knowledge necessary to solve the problem at hand.\nRBES originated in the late sixties and early seventies at\nStanford university, with a group of researchers led by Ed\nFeigenbaum. Feigenbaum and his colleagues were inspired\nby work by cognitive psychologists Newell and Simon, who\naround the same time published a book in which they argued\nthat human experts store their knowledge in the brain in\nthe form of interconnected chunks of knowledge that can be\nwell modeled by means of logical rules [21]. Based on this\ndiscovery, Feigenbaum’s group started to experiment with\ncomputer programs that tried to mimic this. The first such\nsuccessful experiments were DENDRAL and MYCIN. The\nDENDRAL system was used to infer the composition of\na material using spectral information [22]. MYCIN was a\nrule-based system that was capable of diagnosing a bacterial\ninfection, and of prescribing the right kind of antibiotic for\nit. Using only a few hundred rules MYCIN was able to\noutperform both junior and senior doctors [23].\nSince DENDRAL and MYCIN, rule-based expert systems\nhave been successfully used for a variety of applications,\nin many fields from different disciplines of the sciences\nand engineering. PROSPECTOR was utilized to predict the\nlocation of ore deposits [24]. The 


R1/XCON system was\ndeveloped to help DEC do automatic configuration of their\nVAX terminals [25]. A non-exhaustive list of rule-based\nsystems with their main functions and domains of application\nis provided in Table 2. Several of these examples are taken\nfrom work developed at the NASA Johnson Space Center\n[26].\nRBES essentially combine large knowledge databases with\nvery efficient pattern matching algorithms. Domain knowl-\nedge about how to solve a class of problems is stored in\nthe working memory in the form of logical rules, whereas\nknowledge about the input problem at hand is stored in the\nform of facts. Facts use particular data structures called\ntemplates. A template is a list of pairs slot-value, where the\nslot contains the name of a certain property and the value\nstores the value assigned to that property. Values can be\nsymbols \(e.g strings, scalars launch\nvehicles”, which contains five slots: name, performance-\nto-700km-SSO, payload-diameter payload-length, and cost.\nOne or more launch vehicle facts can be added into working\nmemory \(or asserted using the assert command:\n\(assert \(launch-vehicle \(name LV-1 performance-to-700km-\nSSO 3,000 payload-diameter 3.0 payload-length 5.0 LHS state-\nment, and a right hand side \(RHS conditions that take the\nform of facts. The RHS contains a set of actions that typically\ninvolve the modification of existing facts and the creation of\nnew facts. These actions are executed only if the conditions\nin the LHS are all satisfied.\nMore precisely, the inference algorithm performs two actions\niteratively: pattern matching all the facts with all the LHS\nof the rules, which yields one activation record per match-\ning, and executing actions, which asserts and modifies facts\naccording to the RHS of the rules in the activation records.\nEvery time a rule is fired, the pattern matching is redone, but\nin a very efficient way thanks to the use of the Rete algorithm\n[27]. An OPM diagram of this process is illustrated in Figure\n2.\nResearch Goals\nThe goal of this piece of research is to develop a methodology\nto assess the value of a system architecture. The methodology\nhas several requirements:\n\(1 maximization\nof value delivery to stakeholders, in the most explicit and\nholistic way. This is in opposition to other approaches\nexclusively based on profit or technical performance.\n\(2 of handling large\nquantities of heuristic and subjective knowledge efficiently.\nThis includes having data structures and algorithms that can\n4\nFigure 1.

This requirement stems from the combination\nof large uncertainty in the architecture process and the com-\nplicated coupling and emergent behavior that is characteristic\nof system architecting. The goal is to support the system\narchitect by providing not only the value of a system archi-\ntecture, but also the explanations behind this value.\n\(4 methodology must capture emergent behavior.\nEmergent behavior occurs when a combination of elements,\nprocesses, or capabilities creates a new capability that the\nindividual elements were unable to perform. Value delivered\nto stakeholders usually stems from emergent behavior, which\njustifies the importance to model it correctly.\nIn this paper, a methodology is proposed that satisfies these\nrequirements through the use of RBES. In particular, a rules\nengine is incorporated into the traditional objective or value\nfunction. A rule-based approach was chosen over other\nmore complex knowledge-based systems \(e.g., frame-based\nsystems because:\n\(1 in other words,\neveryone understands and if-then statement 2 are called\ntemplates and essentially are variations of LISP’s assoc-lists,\nare ideal to capture most of the architectural decisions.\n\(3 ASSESSMENT OF SYSTEM\nARCHITECTURES USING RULES\n\(VASSAR system\narchitectures using rules is described in this section. The\ntool leverages from the communicating power of logical rules\nas data structures, from the natural recursivity of functional\nlanguages, and from the traceability and scalability of rules\nengines, to efficiently incorporate a large quantity of expert\nknowledge into the value functions.\nFigure 3. Fuzzy number data structure\nFigure 4. Membership functions for fuzzy numbers repre-\nsenting requirement satisfaction\nFuzzy Numbers\nVASSAR uses a fundamental data structure that we call fuzzy\nnumbers. Our fuzzy numbers are a special case of fuzzy\nsets in the sense of Zadeh [28], with 


triangular membership\nfunctions, and center-of-gravity “defuzzyfication”. A fuzzy\nnumber consists of a parameter \(string min, max, mean string assessment\n\(string equivalently seen\nas: a deviation spatial resolution = 55+-\n45 \(m n“medium-high”. The representation of a fuzzy number \(class\nand one example instance 3.\nIn VASSAR, fuzzy numbers are used to represent both the\ncost and performance of a system architecture, and the re-\nquirements and preferences from stakeholders. In particular,\nthe level at which a certain requirement is satisfied is encoded\nusing a fuzzy number, according to the membership functions\nillustrated in Figure 4 It is important to note that in addition\nto these fuzzy numbers, crisp values of 0% and 100% satis-\nfaction are also possible for extreme cases in which there is\nno uncertainty concerning the satisfaction of the requirement.\nThis is useful to encode “utopia” \(e.g. spatial resolution\nbelow one meter from GEO show-stopper” \(e.g. no\nall-weather capability input-output highest level of abstraction \(level 0 by convention a\nmapping from the domain of architectural decisions to the\ndomain of value, or utility to stakeholders.\nMore precisely, the input to VASSAR is a system architecture\nrepresented as an unordered list of pairs decision value. This\ndata structure is called assoc-list in the LISP programming\n6\nFigure 5. Architecture data structure\nlanguage. Values are symbols and therefore can contain any\nnumeric value, string, or generic data structure including a\nfuzzy number. The representation of an architecture \(the\nclass and one example instance is provided in Figure 5.\nThe example is based on a hypothetical soil moisture remote\nsensing satellite mission carrying two instruments, for which\nwe focus on three high-level decisions: the orbit altitude \(400,\n600, or 800km dawn-dusk, AM, or PM encoding\nwhether the two instruments are flown on a single spacecraft\nor on two different spacecraft.\nGiven these decisions and options, the size of the tradespace\n\(i.e. the number of different possible architectures is 3×3×\n2 = 18 architectures. Note that, in general, the size of the\ntradespace is given by the product of the number of options\nper decision, and therefore it grows exponentially with the\nnumber of decisions, where the base is the geometric average\nnumber of options per decision.\nThe output of the VASSAR methodology is a fuzzy number\nrepresenting the value of the system architecture defined as\nthe ability of the system architecture to satisfy stakeholder\nrequirements. In the case of our example mission, an archi-\ntecture could for example be assigned a fuzzy number “80-\n90%: fully satisfies all critical requirements and most non-\ncritical requirements”. This value would be accompanied by\ndetailed explanations \(plain text requirements\nare fully satisfied, which non-critical requirements are only\npartially satisfied or completely missed, and why, e.g.: “the\narchitecture fully satisfies hydroclimatology requirements for\nsoil moisture data products thanks to the combination of\nactive and passive datasets using disaggregation scheme”, or\n“the architecture misses weather hydrometeorology require-\nments for soil moisture data products because of insufficient\nspatial resolution”.\nThe blackbox diagram of VASSAR using these two data\nstructures is illustrated in Figure 6.\nLevel-1 model of VASSAR\nThe theory of system architecture teaches us to architect a\nsystem by going from stakeholder requirements to a func-\ntional decomposition of the system and then to a decompo-\nsition in terms of form through the definition of an integrated\nconcept. Assessing the value of an architecture can be seen\nas performing the opposite process of architecting. Thus, as a\nfirst approximation the VASSAR methodology assesses the\nvalue of a system architecture by computing the capabilities\nof a system architecture and then comparing the capabilities\nwith the stakeholder requirements.\nOur use of the word capabilities deserves further explana-\ntions. Systems provide value to stakeholders because they\nare capable of conducting certain functions at the required\nlevel of performance, i.e., capability is function at perfor-\nmance. Some authors use the term capabilities to designate\nthe function, without the performance side e.g., “this mission\nFigure 6. Blackbox model of VASSAR\nhas the capability of measuring soil moisture this\npaper, the term capabilities includes both the function and\nthe performance \(e.g., “this mission has the capability of\nmeasuring soil moisture with a spatial resolution of 10km,\nan accuracy of 5%, and a temporal resolution of 3 days non-linear and non-sequential, as it\ncaptures the emergent behavior that leads to creation of\nvalue. New capabilities are created from combinations of\nexisting capabilities, and higher level performance attributes\ncan only be computed as the required level performance\nattributes become available. Individual rules can be written\nto compute each performance attribute, which has at least\ntwo advantages: a flexibility, because the way\nan attribute is computed can be changed without changing\nanything else in the 


program; b of the code.\nAt the first level of decomposition, the VASSAR method-\nology consist of three major processes that occur in se-\nquence: first, the capabilities of an architecture \(function and\nperformance from the architectural decisions\nusing domain knowledge; second, requirement satisfaction\nis computed by comparing capabilities with stakeholder re-\nquirements; third, individual requirement satisfaction is ag-\ngregated into one or a handful of metrics that represents the\nvalue of the system architecture, using information about\nstakeholder preferences.\nIn parallel of these three processes, an explanation facility\nkeeps track of the entire value delivery loop, from architecture\nto value through capabilities and requirement satisfaction,\nand constructs a set of explanations that are provided to the\nuser with the value fuzzy number This process is illustrated\nin Figure 7.\nLevel-2 model of VASSAR\nIn this section, the three steps of the VASSAR methodology\nare described in more detail.\nStep 1: Compute Capabilities—Capabilities can usually be\ncomputed from architectural decisions using domain knowl-\nedge in the form for example of physics laws However, the\n7\nFigure 7. Level 1 model of VASSAR\nprocess of computing capabilities from decisions and domain\nknowledge typically is highly non-linear and non-sequential.\nIn other words, capabilities are computed as the information\nrequired to compute them becomes available, and they must\nbe recomputed every time this information changes. It is\nprecisely for this reason that rule-based engines are naturally\nfit for the process of computing capabilities from decisions.\nThe system architect can focus on the domain-specific code,\nand let the RBES take care of the execution flow control,\nincluding all the required iteration.\nThe following example better illustrates how capabilities are\ncomputed from decisions. In our moisture mission, orbit\naltitude \(a decision capabilities another\ndecision impacts illumination\nconditions, and sensitivity to soil moisture due to diurnal\ncycles \(capabilities also impacts cost through the\npower and thermal budgets of the spacecraft. The decision to\nfly the two instruments on a single spacecraft or on separate\nspacecraft will affect both science and cost. If flown on\na single spacecraft, the instruments can share a dish, and\ndata cross-registration will be easier, but they are also forced\nto share resources such as power and data rate, potentially\nresulting in a decreased duty cycle for one or both of the\ninstruments. If flown on dedicated spacecraft, two spacecraft\nneed to be designed implemented, tested, launched, and\noperated, but the design of each bus is simpler and can be\ntailored to the specific instrument. Individual instrument data\nrates are higher, but synergies between instruments are harder\nto exploit. This complicated network of interactions is better\nmodeled using RBES than using traditional procedure-based\nmodels, for which iteration would be required. We show later\nhow a few rules suffice to capture most of the variation of\nvalue across this tradespace.\nThe process of computing capabilities can be decomposed\ninto five main processes, as illustrated in Figure 8: a architectural facts; b decomposition; c performance.\nFrom these five processes, the assertion of architectural facts\nalways occurs first. The process takes an architecture and\nasserts all the corresponding system, subsystem, and compo-\nnent facts. Note that VASSAR uses a 3-level form decompo-\nsition nomenclature \(system, subsystems, and components INCOSE’s recommendation [29]. For example, in\nthe case of our mission, the mission itself is the system the\nspacecraft are the subsystems, and the instruments are the\ncomponents. More than three levels are rarely required in\nthe context of system architecture. Fewer \(two systems.\nSubsystem and component facts created through manifest\nrules typically have many slots empty, because not all prop-\nerties are directly set by architectural variables. These slots\nare filled out in the second step, called attribute inheritance.\nThere are three main types of attribute inheritance: a from upper levels of the architectural hierarchy,\ne.g., the orbit of an instrument is inherited from the orbit of\nits parent spacecraft; b characteristics, e.g., the\nangular resolution of an instrument; c are calculated using several other attributes,\ne.g., the cross-track ground spatial resolution of a side-\nlooking instrument can be computed from the orbit altitude\nh, its off-nadir angle ?off , and its angular resolution ??:\n?xct = h\(tan\(?off +\n??\n2\n off ? ??\n2\n 1 initial set of capabilities\nthrough the application of capability rules. These capability\nrules have the following structure: IF there is a certain combi-\nnation of components with certain attributes, THEN assert a\ncertain capability. For example, in the case of our example\nmission, one of these rules can read, in natural language:\nIF there is an L-band radiometer, THEN assert a capability\nto measure soil moisture. At this point 


the performance\nattributes of this measurement \(i.e., its accuracy, temporal\nresolution, spatial resolution and so forth capabilities and performance,\noccur simultaneously: the performance of both basic and\nemergent capabilities is computed as the required attributes\nbecome available; emergent capabilities are asserted as their\nrequired capabilities with the required performance attributes\nare asserted; this runs iteratively in a loop until no more\n8\nemergent capabilities can be asserted, and all performance\nattributes that can be calculated have been calculated. Con-\nvergence criteria can be included in the rules to break poten-\ntially infinite loops in the execution flow as needed \(e.g., in\nthe design of a spacecraft, the sizing of the power subsystem\ndepends on the power requirements of the ADCS, which\ndepend on the mass of the spacecraft and therefore on the\nmass of the power subsystem, thus creating a loop that is\nresolved by introducing a convergence criteria on the in dry\nmass between consecutive iterations in-\nheritance rules, but they concern capability facts instead of\narchitectural facts. Performance attributes of capability facts\nare sometimes inherited or directly copied from the corre-\nsponding component facts. For example, the ground spatial\nresolution of a measurement taken by a certain instrument\nis given by the ground spatial resolution of the instrument.\nOther performance attributes must be calculated from combi-\nnations of available attributes.\nEmergence rules are responsible for asserting new capa-\nbilities from combinations of existing capabilities. Their\nstructure is the following: IF there is a certain combination\nof capabilities with certain performance, THEN assert a new\ncapability with a new performance. For example, in the case\nof our example mission, disaggregation schemes allow to\ncombine the high resolution, low accuracy dataset from the\nradar with the low resolution, high accuracy dataset from the\nradiometer to obtain a medium-high resolution, high accuracy\ndataset [30]. A rule capturing this emergent behavior could\nread, in natural language: IF there is a soil moisture dataset\nwith high spatial resolution and low accuracy, and another\nsoil moisture dataset with low spatial resolution and high\naccuracy, and the two datasets are cross-registered THEN\nassert a new soil moisture dataset with medium spatial resolu-\ntion and high accuracy. Note the importance of the condition\nthat the two datasets be cross-registered in order for the new\ncapability to be asserted: the disaggregation scheme may be\nhard to apply to architectures in which the two instruments\nare not on the same spacecraft.\nAttribute inheritance, performance, and capability rules use\ntwo types of mappings between variables: a then sensitivity to soil moisture is high”.\nEquations are used whenever it is possible, as they allow\nexact reasoning. Heuristics are used: a results\nare approximately known for regions of the input space; in\nthis context they act as the equivalent of response surfaces\nin purely discrete domains; b often the most natural way of\nexpressing subjective knowledge, e.g.: “if the architecture is\ncomposed of small satellites, then it is more likely to be robust\nto political instability”.\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can\nmanually enter one-of-a-kind capability rules. However, a\nspreadsheet-based user interface was implemented for rapid\ncoding of attribute inheritance rules, and repetitive capability\nrules.\nStep 2: Compute Requirement Satisfaction—Capabilities and\nsatisfaction are not synonyms Indeed, having more capabil-\nities does not always linearly translate into more value \(i.e.\nmore stakeholder satisfaction satellites\nFigure 9. Level 2 VASSAR, step 2: Computing satisfaction\ndoes not increase linearly as revisit time decreases. In-\nstead, the relationship between capabilities and requirement\nsatisfaction may exhibit discrete steps \(e.g., the ability to\nsee shorter time-scale phenomena such as cloud formation e.g., we get no marginal benefit from\ndecreasing temporal resolution below a certain level because\nwe are limited by the performance of current algorithms e.g a\nconcave risk aversion envelope capturing decreasing marginal\nbenefit relationship\nbetween capabilities and satisfaction is expressed in the form\nof requirement satisfaction rules that capture these discrete\nsteps, saturation effects, and non-linear continuous envelopes\n\(see Figure 9 architecture.\nMathematically, they map the multidimensional space of\ncapabilities/performance to the one-dimensional space of\nsatisfaction for one particular requirement. We call these\nmappings satisfaction functions. Note that there are as many\nsatisfaction functions as there are requirements.\nThe simplest possible satisfaction function is an identity\nsatisfaction function. This implies a perfectly linear relation-\nship between capabilities/performance and satisfaction. For\nexample, the value of an imaging satellite can be summarized\nin a performance attribute of #images per day, so that a system\nA that produces twice as many 


images per day as a system\nB, is also providing twice as much value to its stakeholders.\nHowever, this is rarely the case in practice.\nIn general, a requirement takes the form of a capability plus\na number of conditions on performance attributes, e.g.: our\nmission shall measure soil moisture with a spatial resolution\nof 10km or better and a temporal resolution of 2-3 days. In\nthis case, the requirement provides a single threshold value\nfor each performance attribute \(i.e., spatial resolution and\ntemporal resolution type of requirements leads to a step\nsatisfaction function: either the requirement is fully satisfied,\nif all the performance attributes are at or above the threshold\nvalues; or it is not satisfied at all, in any other case.\nStep functions are very simple to implement as they only\nrequire one rule per requirement. Moreover many require-\nments in practice consist of a single threshold value. How-\never, one rule is arguably not sufficient to capture complex\nsatisfaction functions. On the other side of the spectrum,\nwe could imagine using a continuous function to map the\nmulti-dimensional performance attribute space to the one-\ndimensional requirement satisfaction space. Inferring the\nshape of such continuous satisfaction functions is challenging\nin general, and would require the use of formal elicitation\nmethods such as utility theory or AHP 13].\nA possible compromise between step functions and arbitrary\ncontinuous functions is using discrete curves with a handful\n9\nFigure 8. Level 2 VASSAR, step 1: Computing capabilities\nof steps. In fact, many system requirement documents ex-\npress requirements using a target value and a threshold value.\nThis suggests the use of bi-level satisfaction functions. Bi-\nlevel or multi-level satisfaction functions are fully defined\nby a set of thresholds and a set of corresponding satisfaction\nvalues.\nNote that, mathematically, step functions have one-\ndimensional domains. However, as stated before, the domain\nof satisfaction functions \(i.e., the capabilities domain attributes simultaneously \(e.g., spatial reso-\nlution and temporal resolution constant\nvalues in one-dimensional satisfaction functions become re-\ngions or hyperplanes of constant values in multi-dimensional\nsatisfaction functions.\nMulti-dimensional satisfaction functions can in principle be\navoided by using different rules \(and satisfaction functions each individual\nattribute. For example, in the preceding example, three\ndifferent rules and satisfaction functions could be used for\naccuracy, spatial resolution, and temporal resolution. How-\never, the combination of the satisfaction values referring to\nindividual performance attributes is still necessary and simply\ndeferred to the value aggregation step. Furthermore, this\ncombination process may itself be very challenging. Simple\nsolutions, such as computing the product of individual at-\ntribute satisfaction to obtain subobjective satisfaction, may be\ninappropriate due to the coupling between individual require-\nments. For example, the threshold for spatial resolution may\ndepend on the temporal resolution provided by the system,\nand vice-versa.\nThese problems are best avoided by using multi-dimensional\nsatisfaction functions that take into account several attributes\nat the same time. The drawback of this approach is that it\ncould potentially require many steps \(and thus many rules example,\nassuming a bi-level satisfaction function for temporal reso-\nlution, spatial resolution, and accuracy, leads to 8 possible\nperformance scenarios. A multi-dimensional satisfaction\nfunction would thus require in principle 8 rules, one per\nscenario. The one-dimensional satisfaction function would\nrequire 3 rules \(one per attribute between\nattributes. In practice, the multi-dimensional approach may\nbe easier to implement for reasonable numbers of attributes,\nwhere as the single-dimension approach is almost necessary\nfor many attributes. Note that in the multi-dimensional it is\nsometimes possible to use expert knowledge in order to cover\nonly the subset of these 8 scenarios that are actually plausible.\nAn important remark concerning this methodology is that\nrequirement satisfaction uses case-based reasoning: one par-\nticular rule only covers one particular case e.g., the nominal\ncase in which spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and\naccuracy are all at or above the desired level for those\nattributes i.e., if any\nof the attributes is below the desired level satisfaction\nof this requirement are fired, it will be considered that the\nsystem architecture provides a null 0 system architecture, the tool would\ncome up with a value of 0.0 for this system architecture.\nTherefore, it is important to cover all necessary cases for\neach requirement. One could think that this would lead\nto an infeasible number of requirement satisfaction rules\ncapturing all possible degraded cases. In practice however,\nwe have found from conversations with experts that one full\nsatisfaction rule plus a handful of partial satisfaction rules\ncan cover all realistic cases for a given set of architectural\ndecisions.\nNote that multi-level step functions can approximate any\ncontinuous or discrete satisfaction function at the 


desired\nlevel of accuracy by simply increasing the number of steps.\nIn particular, any of Messac’s canonical satisfaction function\ncan be modeled [31].\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can enter\none-of-a-kind requirement satisfaction rules. However, a\nspreadsheet-based user interface was implemented for rapid\ncoding of multi-step satisfaction functions, which have all the\nsame structure.\nStep 3a Aggregate Requirement Satisfaction—The prefer-\nence domain is hyperdimensional because there is at least one\ndimension per requirement, and in a complex system there\ncan easily be several hundreds or even thousands of require-\nments. Dominated architectures could easily be eliminated\nby means of Pareto analysis, but this is unlikely to reduce\nthe size of the tradespace by much due to the large number\nof requirements. Hence, the problem remains of choosing\nbetween architectures that have very different requirement\n10\nFigure 10. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3a: Aggregate satisfaction\nsatisfaction sets, but seem globally equally attractive. In prac-\ntice, the dimensionality of this domain needs to be reduced in\norder to be able to make a decision concerning the preferred\narchitectures. This requires the use of subjective information\ncapturing stakeholder preferences.\nHence, the last step of the methodology is the reduction of the\ndimensionality of the preference domain through aggregation\nof requirement \(i.e., subobjective then into stakeholder satisfaction. This two-\nstep aggregation process requires the elicitation of a list of\nobjectives and subobjectives from different stakeholders, and\nreduces the dimensionality of the preference domain \(i.e., the\nnumber of metrics Nsh\nto 1 if the relative importance of stakeholders to a central\nstakeholder is introduced. The relative importance of stake-\nholders can be formally computed by applying quantitative\nstakeholder analysis techniques e.g. stakeholder networks\n[32 represents the value of the system\narchitecture to the central stakeholder. The entire process is\nillustrated in Figure 10.\nMathematically, requirement aggregation rules reduce the\ndimensionality of the satisfaction space by using aggregation\nfunctions. Aggregation functions combine arithmetic and\nlogical operators. The simplest and most commonly used\narithmetic operator is the weighted average. For example, the\nsatisfaction of a stakeholder is given by a weighted average\nof the satisfaction of its objectives. More sophisticated arith-\nmetic operators are also possible \(see for example Yager’s\nordered weighted averaging operator or Fortin’s gradual num-\nbers [33], [34 type, such as the at-least-n-out-of-\nk condition: “the stakeholder is satisfied if 3 or more of these\n4 objectives are satisfied.”\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can man-\nually define one-of-a-kind aggregation functions. Weighted\naverages can be rapidly coded in from a spreadsheet-based\nuser interface.\nStep 3b: Prepare Explanations—The VASSAR methodology\nprovides a set of explanations that accompany the fuzzy value\nmetric. This is central to the methodology, as it satisfies one\nof its key requirements, namely that of showing traceability\nof the value delivery loop. Explanation rules keep track of\nTable 3.

CASE STUDY\nWe selected a hypothetical soil moisture remote sensing\nsatellite mission as the case study to show the applicability\nthe VASSAR methodology. This hypothetical mission would\ncombine instruments that are similar to real instruments flown\nor to be flown in NASA and ESA missions References to\nthese missions will be made as required. This example was\ndesigned to illustrate different features of the methodology:\n\(1 elements of subjectivity, which are hard to\nmodel in traditional design tools;\n\(2 emergent behavior that actu-\nally drives an important part of the value delivery;\n\(3 of complexity, as it is complex\nenough to yield non-trivial results, but simple enough to avoid\nthe need to provide excessive background.\nPayload description\nFor this example we consider five candidate instruments:\na an L-band polarimetric radiometer \(LRADIO synthetic\naperture radar \(LSAR XRADIO IR P-band polarimetric\nSAR \(PSAR mass, power data rate, performance tradespace\nFor this example, we chose to represent an architecture as\nthe set of decisions laid out in Table 


3. The set of possible\narchitectures is given by the Cartesian product of the ranges\nof values in Table 3 which consists of 3,636 architectures.\n11\nFigure 11. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3b: Prepare explanations\nStakeholder requirements\nFive stakeholder groups or panels were identified for this\nexample, labeled as follows: weather climate, ecosystems,\nwater, and applications. All five panels were initially con-\nsidered equally important; a case with non-uniform weights\nis considered later in the sensitivity analysis. Note that the\npanels’ relative weights could be obtained through a formal\nmethod such as the one proposed by Cameron et al [32].\nThe specific objectives of each panel, as well as their relative\nranking, are provided in Appendix B.\nCapability rules\nNominal instrument capabilities are presented in Appendix\nA. However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters. Below are\na few examples of situations in which data quality is severely\ncompromised due to orbital parameters.\nLighting conditions—Visible and NIR instruments \(namely\nthe corresponding channels of the IR radiometer node because they cannot gather\nenough light.\nImage distortion—Side-looking instruments cannot work at\nlow altitudes because image distortion becomes unaccept-\nable.\nEmergence rules\nEmergent behavior plays a key role in value delivery to\nstakeholders. We describe in this subsection a few examples\nof emergent behavior \(both in science and cost spatial\nresolution soil moisture dataset provided by LRADIO can be\ncombined with the lower accuracy, higher spatial resolution\ndataset provided by LSAR to produce a new high accuracy,\nmedium spatial resolution dataset.\nSample averaging—In any dataset, part of the non-systematic\nerror can be reduced by averaging samples in time or space,\nthus effectively creating a new dataset that trades accuracy\nagainst spatial or temporal resolution.\nLevel-4 data products—A level-4 net carbon ecosystem ex-\nchange dataset can be created from the combination of a\nlevel-3 soil moisture dataset and several ancillary products,\nnamely land surface temperature, vegetation state, and land-\ncover status.\nMultispectral measurements—IR and MW snow and ice cover\ndatasets can be combined to produce new, multispectral, more\naccurate datasets.\nSharing a common dish—The L-band radar and radiometer\ncan share a common antenna thus effectively reducing the\ntotal mass of the system.\nLearning Curve—If several identical satellites are developed\nand fabricated, the marginal cost of the second and subse-\nquent units is lower than the cost of the first unit due to\nlearning.\nResults\nThe set of 3,636 architectures was evaluated using VASSAR.\nThe benefit portion is based on the set of requirements from\nAppendix B. The cost portion is based on the cost model de-\nscribed in Appendix C. The point science scores and lifecycle\ncost estimates for all these architectures are shown on Figure\n12. These numbers are obtained from defuzzyfying the fuzzy\n12\nFigure 12. Expected science vs expected lifecycle cost for\n3,636 architectures \(uniform weights analysis—The main goal of any system architect-\ning tool is to gain insight into the “shape” of the tradespace,\nwhat the main trades are, whether there are families of\narchitectures, and so on. We observe several features just by\nlooking at the tradespace in Figure 12:\n\(1 a science score\nof 0. This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate. An example of the latter is when a side-\nlooking instrument is put at 400km, resulting in a too large\nimage distortion.\n\(2 unresolvable conflicting require-\nments. In this particular case, most of the observations\nrequire a SSO in order to get rid of diurnal variations in radi-\nance. However, a small subset of requirements that concern\noceanography or cryospheric measurements are ideally taken\nin true polar, non-SSO orbits, in order to avoid tidal aliasing\n\(oceanography cryosphere it is impossible to be in a polar\nand SSO orbit simultaneously, some value is going to be lost\nno matter what decision is made.\n\(3 costs. This is a typical behavior in\narchitectural tradespaces, that has its origins in the non-linear\nmapping between capabilities and satisfaction, namely in the\nquantization of satisfaction levels. In other words slightly\ndifferent performances may be perceived as equivalent in\nterms of satisfaction by stakeholders.\nExplanation facility—The explanation facility provides sup-\nport for more advanced analysis of the tradespace. Examples\nof the features of the explanation facility are listed below:\n\(1 The explanation facility provides\ndetailed explanations of the scores of an architecture in text\nformat as required by the user. An example of such informa-\ntion is provided in Table 4.\n\(2 support: The explanation facility\ncan provide information about one or more architectures on\nFigure 13 


Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy results—We emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., “Most” or “Some larger.\nSensitivity Analysis—There are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis. The red line shows the\ncorrespondence between scalar mass and scalar cost through\na parametric relationship embedded in the tool.\n3 merit change\nwhen each variable is changed. Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17. This kind of results can be useful to determine the\noptimal evolution of an architecture, such as in determining\nan optimal descoping option in the event of a downward\nbudget.\n15\nTable 6.

All capabilities are directly traceable to architectural\ndecisions.\n\(2  e.g., sci-\nence and engineering back-\ngrounds, simply because it is the way in which the human\nmind works.\n\(3  the domain-specific\nknowledge from the domain-independent knowledge, which\ntranslates into increased scalability and reusability, and facil-\nitates task allocation between system architects and software\nengineers.\n\(4  lessons learned: it serves as\na repository of knowledge to conserve expertise, and it also\nuses the lessons learned in the form of logical rules to evaluate\nsystem architectures.\n\(5  delivery loop facilitates more\n16\noptimal task allocation between man \(the system architect the computational tool architectures and through the use of the text-\nbased and graphics-based explanation facility. The system\narchitect feeds the tool with knowledge, guides the tradespace\nexploration process, and makes all non-objective decisions.\n\(6  of recursive algorithms, which\nare at the core of modeling emergence, which in turn is the\norigin of value.\n\(7  8  a computational price, which is only\nworth it if the knowledge base is likely to evolve.\n\(9  slow when the number of rules is very\nlarge.\n\(10  the expert knowledge \(e.g. lessons learned specific\npurpose: evaluating system architectures in the context of\nautomatic architectural tradespace exploration. Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSAR’s\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
