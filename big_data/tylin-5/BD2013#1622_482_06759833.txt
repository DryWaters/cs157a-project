As it is\nstated in slow-start phase of the congestion-avoidance algorithm,\nthe congestion window increases by a minimum of one MSS\neach round-trip time \(RTT data\ntransmission is inversely related to RTT. Note that in long-delay\nnetworks the packet-loss recovery is slower than typical medium-\nsize networks. Thus, so the throughput is lower.\nWe propose the use of a TCP proxy node as a solution to this\nsituation. That is, a node will capture the data package that was\nsent by the transmitter, copy it and send the acknowledgement\npackage to the client and the original data package to the\nreceiver, this is accomplish because the node is transparent to\nthe transmitter and the receiver. We show that our approach is\neffective in this scenario by increasing the throughput linearly\nwith the number of proxy nodes.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDuring the last years, technological advances in storage\nand computer processing have allowed the increment of the\namount of available data. This phenomenon impacts scientific\nand research fields For instance, in astronomy the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey \(SDSS night [1] since year 2,000, and its succes-\nsor, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope \(LSST operational in 2020, is expected to gather about 30\nTerabytes of data each night [2]. In Nuclear physics, the Large\nHadron Collider \(LHC 15\nmillion Gigabytes to fill more than\n1.7 million dual-layer DVDs a year [3]. Something similar\nhappens with other fields, like bioinformatics, mining, chem-\nical science, atmosphere science, etc. This advances implies\nchallenges in data transmission.\nThis trend of information increasing is not only related\nto science. In our new generations, the number of internet\nusers, the use of social networks, the experience acquired\nfor users and the variety of forms to be connected, caused\nthe user requirements are increased too. This is reflected in\nthe popularity of video streaming, that represent 20-40% of\ninternet traffic [4] and implies the quickly transmission of\nseveral Megabytes of information.\nNevertheless, Internet itself has not made changes in the\nessence of its operation For 30 years, TCP [5] has been the\nmost widely used transport protocol, mainly because it is a\nconnection oriented protocol, that ensures the entire message\nto be sent successfully, achieved by applying error control\nprotocols [5], [6], flow control protocols [5] and congestion\ncontrol protocols [7].\nHowever, it have been studied that TCP performance may\nbe affected by external factors, such as the distance between\nthe connection extremes and intermediate hops [8], [9] \(which\nis the case of transactions between two different continents  which\nis the case of residential broadband networks TCP tries to keep a correct operation.\nFor these problems have been proposed some solutions:\nLakshman and Upamanyu Madhow [8] were interested in the\nstudy of networks with large round-trip delays: they compared\nthe performance of two different types of TCP \(Reno and\nTahoe a\nmodification in the congestion control protocol, principally a\ndifferent way to set the window size after a loss, probably\nusing selective acknowledgments. K. Tan and J. Song [11]\nproposed a new congestion control protocol for high-speed and\nlong delay environments, based on a new method that reacts\nearlier to congestion by sensing the changes on RTT. The work\nof M. Podlesny and C. Williamson [12] proposes the use of\nan Asymmetric Queueing \(AQ   the\ninfluence of some parameters, such as buffer size or maximum\nwindow size, in several TCP stacks behavior They concluded\nthat the the best performance is not obtained using fixed TCP\nparameters, but identifying optimal values for each situation\nand following the IETF recommendation about using advanced\nTCP.\nIn this paper, we are focused on the study of the TCP\nperformance, particularly the case of the transmission of large\namounts of data over long distance networks. The study\nincludes a more detailed analysis of TCP performance in\nseveral simulated scenarios and the behavior of its congestion\ncontrol protocol.\nThe rest of this article is structured as follows.

TCP IN A NUTSHELL\nTCP is a connection-oriented communication protocol,\nhighly developed and complex. It is intended to ensure an\nerror free, loss less and safe service that allows communication\nbetween two systems. To fulfill those purposes TCP uses\nCongestion Avoidance Algorithm and Flow Control Algorithm\nthat ensures its correct behavior.\nA. Congestion Avoidance Algorithm\nThe Congestion Avoidance Algorithm is in charge of\ncontrol the amount of data being injected into the network 


and\nits main objective is the transmission of the greatest amount\nof data it is capable to send without losses.\nThe main tool used to accomplish its objective is the\ncongestion window \(cwnd variable that\nlimits the amount of data a TCP can send. The congestion\nwindow is set to an appropriate value while data is sent. The\nprocess is conformed by two principal phases:\n• First is used a Slow Start algorithm to control the\ntransmission rate. The congestion window is defined\nto one segment, that correspond to the maximum\nsegment size \(MSS according\nto the window size. The algorithm increases the con-\ngestion window by one segment for each acknowl-\nedgement received. If the network is not congested\nSlow Start is not very slow, but when network has\nlong response time, it might be slow. During the initial\nphase, some packets may be forced to drop, and the\ncongestion avoidance is used to slow the transmission\nrate. The Slow Start continues up the window size\nachieves a threshold.\n• During the second phase the algorithm uses an addi-\ntive increase and multiplicative decrease to moderate\nthe congestion window size. That is, when there is no\npacket loss, the congestion window is increased every\nRTT \(Round Trip time decreases the congestion window\n[7].\nThe congestion is detected, when a re-transmission timer\nexpires or when duplicate ACKs are received, otherwise when\nthe congestion is warned by a time-out. There are many\ncongestion avoidance algorithms available to use. They differ\nin details like how to detect and react to packet loss. The most\nused are Cubic, and Reno which we will study in depth in the\nnext section.\nB. Flow Control Algorithm\nTo properly match the transmission rate of the sender and\nreceiver in the network context, a Flow Control Algorithm is\nused. It tries to transmit at a high rate, and also protects against\noverloading the slow receiver.\nThe receiver has a reception buffer, in which it stores the\nreceived packets, which have not been processed yet. At the\nsame time, the sender has a send buffer, in which the data to\nbe sent is stored. The sender uses a window field to tell the\nsender how many bytes of data the receiver is willing to accept,\nFigure 1. TCP Proxy as part of TCP spoofing system.\nso it tells the sender how much data, starting from the current\nposition in the TCP data byte stream, can be sent without\nwaiting for further acknowledgements. As data is sent by the\nsender and then acknowledged by the receiver, the window\nslides forward to cover more data in the stream.\nC. TCP Spoofing\nThe TCP Spoofing term is introduce in [13] and it is define\nas a way to solve the TCP performance decrease because\nof high RTT. It is consist in accelerate the TCP congestion\nwindow’s growth, this is possible due to the use of a TCP\nproxy, which create a copy of the ACK package that will\nbe send by the receiver and a copy of the data package that\nwas sent by the transmitter. Then the proxy store the copy of\nthe data package and transmit the original one to the receiver\n\(see Figure 1 control the original ACK\nsent by the receiver, so it has to pass by the proxy, in order\nto be eliminated and the respective data package stored and\nto avoid multiple retransmission problems.\nIII. PERFORMANCE TESTING\nAs throughput is known the average rate of data packet\ntransmission along a communication link. This information\ncan be transmitted by a physical or logic link or through a\nnetwork’s node. This study consist on the observation of the\nthroughput performance of TCP in case of a large amount of\ndata transmission over a network with large RTT.\nAs we stated before, two of the main congestion-avoidance\nalgorithms are RENO [14] and CUBIC [15]. Reno appeared\nin 1990 and was initially implemented in BSD Unix oper-\nating system. In its Slow Start phase the windows size is\nincreased exponentially, in its Congestion Avoidance phase the\ncongestion window is increased in 1/cwnd each time it receives\nan ACK, and when a packet loss occurs the algorithm sets\nthe Slow Start Threshold \(ssthresh congestion window is\nset to ssthresh value plus 3 times the package size; the Fast\nRecovery phase of this algorithm states that if the packet loss\nis detected by three duplicated ACKs, it retransmit that packet\nand waits the entire window for an acknowledgment before\nto start the Slow Start phase. Therefore, an approximation to\nthe theoretical throughput that corresponds to a TCP Reno\ntransmission can be expressed as:\nThroughput = min\(rwnd,\nMSS\nRTT\n?\n2p\n3\n 1 size\nand p is the loss per unit. The minimum is calculated because\nwhen there are no loss, the second term tend to infinite and\nthe throughput value is equivalent to the receptor’s congestion\nwindow \(rwnd in networks with high delays the probability\nto get a loss is also high, so a better approximation of the\nthroughput [18] would be:\nThroughput =\nMSS\nRTT\n?\n2p\n3\n, \(2 algorithm\nin GNU Linux, is equivalent to RENO in all its stages but\nreplacing the linear growth by a cubic function and after a\npacket loss the window is decreased by a factor ?. Therefore,\nthe throughput could be approximated by\nThroughput = MSS ? \(1 3 the higher the RTT,\nthe lower the transmission throughput.\nThen, a testbed is proposed to experiment with the sim-\nulation of a network with high delays on shipping and a\npercentage of packet loss similarly to the 


reality. The testbed\nuses two machines connected with a router, which serve as\nthe server and client respectively. Both computers have Ubuntu\n12.04 as their operative system, also they have 4 Giga of Ram.\nThe router is a Linksys 874 model with dd-wrt software as an\nopen OS for it. The transfer speed’s connection reach 1 Gbps.\nTo induce delay and generate packet loss during the tests,\nwe used the Netem’s network emulation functionality through\ncommand line using tc, that is part of the tools packet\niproute2. The architecture is very similar to the TCP spoofing\nconfiguration with the proxy node so we can use it to test our\nsolution.\nIV RESULTS\nIn this section we explain the experiments we conduct to\nstudy the performance of TCP in large-delay networks and we\nfinally present our solution of using TCP proxies to avoid the\nlow throughput.\nThe first scenario consist in the transmission of 10[GB] of\ndata through a typical RENO TCP connection with a packet\nloss of 0.01% and a delay equal to 5[ms] and 50[ms]. The\nresults of this experiment is shown in Figure 2. As can be\nseen the congestion window can never recover after the first\nloss inducing a steady decline in the size of the congestion\nwindow. Also the 50[ms] takes almost 1500 [s] to send every\ndata package and the 5[ms] just 200[s], this suggests that Reno\nTCP has a slow recovery method.\nTCP RENO: Transfer of 10Gb of data over a 1GB Ethernet connection\n 500\n 1000\n 1500 5ms RTT\n 500\n 1000\n 1500\n 0  200  400  600  800  1000  1200 1400  1600\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  C\nWN\nD \(\nseg\nme\nnts\n seconds 10[GB] with 5[ms] and 50[ms] of delay with\n0.01% of packet loss over a Reno TCP connection. 250 [ms] is not shown\nbecause it is out of bounds.\nSecond experiment, in order to discard that is a congestion-\navoidance implementation problem instead of a behavior in\nmostly used TCP long distance communications, was to send\n1 GB of data from server to client with a delay of 5[ms],\n50[ms] and 250[m]s this time with a 0.01% of loss in a Cubic\nTCP connection. This time can be observed in Figure 3 that\neven with an RTT of 250[ms] the Cubic TCP end’s first the\ntransmission of the full data before even that Reno TCP with\n50[ms]. Cubic manages to recover fast enough to reach the\nmaximum size of the congestion window. Also, note that the\ndata package arrives in bursts as traditional TCP.\nTCP CUBIC: Transfer of 10Gb of data over a 1GB Ethernet connection\n 500\n 1000\n 1500\n 2000\n5ms RTT\n 500\n 1000\n 1500\n 2000\nCW\nND\n \(s\neg\nme\nnts\n 300  400  500  600  700  800  900\nTime \(seconds   50[ms] of delay with\n0.01% of packet loss over a Cubic TCP connection.\nTo be sure that CUBIC behaves better than RENO on this\nlong-distance communication scenario, we performed a final\nexperiment sending 1GB of data from server to client with a\n100ms of delay and a packet loss of 0.1%, plotting the result\nin Figure 4.\nFinally, we measured the bandwidth used by a transmission\nof big data \(1GB note a decay\nin the performance produced by the RTT, as we can see in\nFigure 5-\nTo be sure that the problem is mostly produced by the\ncongestion-avoidance algorithm of TCP we also tested the\nthroughput \(now transferring only 500 MB Figure 6\(a Comparison between Reno and Cubic TCP with 0.1% of packet\nloss and 100ms of delay.\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n0 50 100 150 200 250\nB\nan\nd\nw\nid\nth\n nM\nb\nit\ns/\nse\nc ms Loss\nFigure 5.

Performance using TCP Proxy\nWe propose that using TCP proxies the throughput of TCP\nwill automatically increase because the proxy will give the\nidea to the sender that the receiver is near to it then the RTT\nwill be lower than sending directly the packets to them and,\nas we explained before, the throughput will increase.\nTwo experiments were conducted to check the benefits of\nimplementing a TCP proxies over a typical TCP network [19] :\nthe first one consisted in a typical TCP connection with a RTT\nof 200[ms with a variable but lineal amount of TCP proxy’s\nnodes. And the second experiment determine the best position\nfor the TCP proxy between the Server and the Client.\n\(a b different rmem values\n\(c communication’s down performance \(a b receive\nand \(c a intuition, the throughput increases linearly to the number\nof proxies used \(distributed uniformly in the path b result that the best place to put only\none proxy is in the middle of the path.\n\(a proxies\n\(b CONCLUSIONS\nIn this article we presented a study of TCP performance\nwith great amount of data in long-delay networks. We noted\nthat in this scenario the congestion-avoidance algorithms\n\(RENO and CUBIC

The main problem is that\nthe multiplicative-decreasing congestion window’s algorithm\nseems to be too much aggressive, therefore when the too many\nlosses happen together or near in time \(as usual in burst loses\n[17 decrement in the network’s\nthroughput.\nWe propose as a solution to this problem the use of TCP\nProxies, only one proxy would helps to cut in half the RTT in\neach transmission per proxy used as we shown in Section IV.\nAs future work we pretend to continue studying the benefits\nof using TCP proxies on this long-delay networks scenarios.\nFor instance, it will be interesting to study this problem from\na theoretical point of view: using queuing theory to calculate\nthe optimal number of proxies and the distance among proxies\nin the network, along with the theoretical calculation of the\nperformance of the solution.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Sloan Digital Scan Survey SkyServer, http://skyserver.sdss.org\n[2] Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, http://www.lsst.org\n[3] European Organization for Nuclear Research,\nhttp://public.web.cern.ch/public/\n[4] Rao, A.

as well, that will provide the relay \nprovider with the full insight required to ensure user data \ndelivery and enough control to manage the schedule for all \nlinks and routing updates. \nThe LCRD payload, ground stations and mission operations \ncenter \(MOC DTN techniques during the planned \nexperimental scenarios.  These include published bundle \nprotocol transport protocol, and transfer acknowledgement \nmethods, as well as the flexibility to support some nadditional yet-to-be determined DTN techniques through \nsoftware or firmware changes to the LCRD spacecraft and \nground based systems. \n \nFigure 2 LCRD Design Reference Mission Concept \nA user of the DTN-enabled GEO relay will receive benefits \nbeyond those that are achieved by a bent-pipe relay.  The \nmost significant advantage, in the case of optical space-to-\nground links, is the user is isolated from any issues that \nmight be affecting the trunkline.  A user can continue to \ntransmit data to the relay \(assuming enough relay storage user, the user can free up \nits onboard storage at this point.  In a scenario in which a \nuser is attempting to send data to one or more other users, \nall of the users do not need to have a link simultaneously.  \nThe data is essentially “pre-positioned” onboard the relay \nand the destination users receive the data when they are able \nto connect. \nA reference mission concept for the LCRD mission is \nillustrated in Figure 2. The GEO relay may have multiple \nactive links simultaneously.  The links may be to any \ncombination of user platforms and ground stations.  The \nmultiple ground station links may become active due to \neither pre-determined schedules or may have been \nestablished on relatively short notice due to changing \nweather conditions.  The onboard store and forward \ncapabilities allow for a user-to-relay link to remain active \nindependently of any ground station handover that may be \noccurring.  It may even be possible, through the use of \nrouting individual bundles, to have a user’s data forwarded \nto other users or multiple ground locations – perhaps even \ndirectly to a science archive facility.  As long as there \nremains the storage capacity onboard the relay, the \ndestinations for the user data do not need to be connected \ncontemporaneously with the user.  This allows the \ntransmitting user to maintain its own storage and link \ntransmission times, without consideration of any link \nschedule considerations past its own links to the relay. \nThe same benefits apply in the forward link direction, as \nwell.  User forward link data may be transmitted up to the \nrelay before a user is connected, as long as there is the \navailable trunkline bandwidth and onboard storage.  Pre-\npositioning forward link data in this way provides some \nisolation from any trunkline outages in the forward link ndirection.  In some operational concepts, the forward link \ndata may be for multiple users.  The data can remain \nonboard the GEO relay until each destination becomes \navailable. \nIn order to provide all of this flexibility for users, the relay \nnetwork’s mission operations center must assume the \nresponsibility for the user data flows.  This responsibility \ngoes beyond establishing links based on a schedule.  The \nMOC must now keep an accounting of the user data in \ntransit within the provider system \(onboard the relay or \nwithin a ground station nnetwork must all be managed by the MOC transparently to \nthe users.  The MOC must also be able to provide the nnecessary insight to resolve any lost data issues reported by \nusers.  This increase of networking management complexity \nand responsibility is a significant change from the current \nNASA Space Network operations. \n n4. SUMMARY/CONCLUSION \nThe LCRD mission will provide a prototype for a future \nGEO relay network combining laser communications and \nspace internetworking technologies.  The two years of \n 5 \n \noperations will allow the refinement and demonstrations of \nvarious operations concepts and applications, while also \naddressing the remaining challenges for the implementation \nof a future network It is considered to be a pathfinder for \nNASA putting a laser communications service on the Next \nGeneration Tracking and Data Relay Satellite to be nlaunched sometime next decade. \nREFERENCES  \n  [1] Bernard L.

Impact of d on Latency\nEquation \(8 change of write\nlatency with respect to d more intuitively. The message delay\ndistribution f\(x 0.01. And we also perform a\nnull write to eliminate the influences of log and commit time.\nHowever, even the times of log and commit exist, they do not\ninterfere with our results, because Lw\(1 their\nvalues which will be removed.\nFigure 9 indicates the impact of number of ACKs d\non Latency.

Another\ninteresting observation is that latency with a fixed d decreases\nwhile n is increased. The reason is that the coordinator has\nmore alternative ACKs to select the fastest d ones.\nF. Consistency v.s. Latency\nAs defined in section VI, consistency=1 ? Pwc. Now we\ncombine the results of above two experiments and show the\ntradeoff between consistency and latency. As shown in Figure\n10, the x-axis represents the latency Lw\(d which has removed\nthe value of Lw\(1 Latency\nFig. 10. Consistency v.s. Latency\nPwc\(d 7 and the corresponding d\(1 ? d ?

An Example for Tradeoff of Consistency and Latency\nAssume that there is an online store like Amazon. And it\nhas used RSMs in its sales system. Although we try to collect\nmore practical data about ?, ? and ? \(defined in section VI not\nwant to know the exact value of system benefit B\(d the benefit ratio of\nlatency ? by statistics methods, and then determine d? for the\nmaximal system benefit B\(d and\ntheir average price is V .

So it shows that common practical\nRSM systems \(with d = 1 and d = [n/2]+1 aspect of overall system benefit. We should\nconsider more intermediate states in the consistency spectrum.\nVIII. RELATED WORK\nWe have surveyed many replicated state machine tech-\nniques [23-26] and their variants such as [27-29]. Their three\nrepresentative implementations are non-uniform total order\nbroadcast Paxos and uniform total order broadcast. Although\nRSMs has been long studied, in this work we do not want to\ndesign better algorithms but try to quantitatively analyze these\nworks from the aspects of consistency and latency. In addition,\nprior analysis works [24,33] on RSMs confine in the three\nrepresentative implementations of RSMs and their variants,\nand few considers consistency and latency simultaneously.\nOur analysis covers more than the three typical ones and\nquantitatively reveals the tradeoff between consistency 


and\nlatency.\nConsistency, which has been long studied [39], attracts\nmore eyes in recent years. With the consideration of CAP [3]\nand PACELC [4], people develop a lot of consistency models,\nfrom weakest eventual consistency [9], timeline consistency\n[40] to causal consistency [41]. Instead of developing a new\nconsistency model or performance optimization for existing\nmodels, we discuss when and how the inconsistency occurs,\nand further measure its degree with a probabilistic model in\nthe context of RSMs.\nThere are several works [17,18 presenting bounded read\nstaleness from data versions, stale time and staleness proba-\nbility to evaluate the inconsistency of quorum like [15], anti-\nentropy [35] systems, where writes are committed by vector\n10\nclocks 16] with semantic reconciliation [5] in causal order as\nopposed to total order of RSMs. In this work, we focus on\nwrite inconsistency for RSMs, since read serializability can be\neasily guaranteed in total order to eliminate read staleness.\nSome previous works have been done on write inconsisten-\ncy. [19,20] provide techniques to make writes satisfying some\nconstraints, which use strong and weak consistency to ensure\nthe constraints are not violated. Write divergency of replicas\nare limited in [21,22]. For example, [21] provides some metrics\nsuch as numerical error and order error for data items, and\nthen presents a variety of algorithms for writes to guarantee\npredefined metrics. These write inconsistency models aim to\nimprove the performance in the absence of crash failures, but\nwe want to know how much inconsistency incurred by crash\nfailures a replication system may encounter, rather than confine\nwrites to some constraints, or bound the maximum deviation\nof a value from its newest version.\nIn the context of RSMs, in this work we quantify write\ninconsistency by the probability of write conflict while con-\nsidering crash failures. Furthermore, we calculate write latency\nand describe how to quantitatively make consistency and\nlatency tradeoff from the aspect of system benefit.\nIX. DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we provide several problems that should be\nnoted or considered in future work.\nA. Quorum Systems\nQuorum systems define sets of replicas W written to and\nR read from, which can be configured such as ONE\(W=1 W = [n/2] + 1 W = n other values. This is very like the three representative\nimplementations of RSMs, but they are essentially different.\nThe reason is that writes of quorum systems are ordered\ncausally and those of RSMs are totally ordered. Thus some\nconditions result in write conflict for RSMs but not for quorum\nsystems. For instance write duplication may occur when the\ncoordinator is falsely suspected. In contrast, it is meaningless\nto discuss write conflict for quorum systems because we can\nnot decide the original write and possible duplicated one are\nin the same order or not for the partial orders of writes. In\nthe practical quorum systems at present they mostly view the\nsecond write as a new write.\nHowever, our partial work can be useful for analyzing\nquorum systems. The formula on the expectation of laten-\ncy\(equation \(8 if\nreplacing W to d.\nB. Failure Mode and Failure Detection\nAs discussed in section II, our work is based on the\nassumption of non-Byzantine failures. If we enlarge failure\nmodes to Byzantine ones, our work should be made corre-\nsponding modification. In future work, we will consider this\nextension.\nFor non-Byzantine failures, we have modeled a common\nand popular heartbeat based but not adaptive and fast failure\ndetector Some optimized failure detectors [31,36] use syn-\nchronized clocks or adjust heartbeat intervals adaptively to\nachieve faster failure detection. This means that the expression\nThb2?Thb1 > To?Te in the formula of the probability of false\nsuspicion Pfs = Pr\(Thb2 ? Thb1 > To ? Te detectors.\nC. Coordinator Election and Failure Recovery\nWhile presenting the formula of write duplication, we have\nnoted that coordinator election and failure recovery [32] may\ninfluence its result.\nRSMs run coordinator election and failure recovery after\nsuspicions on coordinators for synchronizing the states of\nboth committed writes and historical records for replicas. This\nsynchronization may enlarge the range of historical records\nperceived by the new coordinator. Thus the historical records\nincurred by writes sent by the suspected coordinator may be\ncaught by the new coordinator during coordinator election and\nfailure recovery. This will avoid the reuse of sequence numbers\nand lower the probability of write duplication. Although we\ncan also provide a formula to measure the impact of coor-\ndinator election and failure recovery on write duplication it\ndepends on the specific processes of them, which can be very\ndifferent.\nD. Independence of Crash Failures and Message Delays\nAlthough we have released some assumptions in the com-\nputation of probability of write conflict and latency, we still\nassume that crash events of different nodes and message\ndelays between replicas are independent. In practice, they do\nnot always hold, since replica nodes and network links in\nmodern data centers usually share physical machines, routers\nand power devices and so on. However, the correlations among\nfailures and delays depend on the specific hardware and\nsoftware implementations. A reasonable solution is to acquire\nthe correlation factors among failures and delays by statistics\nfor established replication systems, and then append them to\nthe probability of crash failures and the message delays for\nmore accurate results.\nX. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we are concerned with providing a quan-\ntitative analysis of the 


relationship between consistency and\nlatency. Given that replicated state machines are widely used\nin modeling replication systems and there are several variants\nof RSM implementations, we first propose a generic model\ncalled RSM-d to give a unified description of major replication\nprotocols using RSMs. Second, on the basis of RSM-d, we\nbuild a probabilistic model for write conflicts that is one of the\nkey factors to cause inconsistency, and a probabilistic model\nfor characterizing latency as well. Third, we further define\na payoff model through combining the write conflict model\nand latency model from the perspective of a service provider.\nFinally, with Monte Carlo based simulation, we validate our\npresented results and show the effectiveness of our solution to\nmake tradeoff between consistency and latency to achieve the\nmaximum system benefit.\n11\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Richong Zhang and Yu\nTang for their discussions and feedback improved this work.\nThis work was supported partly by National Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China No. 61103031, No. 61272165 No. 2012AA011203 Author of National Excellent Doctoral\nDissertation of PR China, partly by Beijing Nova Program\nand partly by Program for New Century Excellent Talents in\nUniversity.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Amazon.com.

Conclusions The SHOTPUT mission , its unique trajectory and potential encounter with six different small bodies will provide a novel view of the composition of the solar system. The science return from the mission will help answer questions on formation, composition and evolution of small bodies in our local neighborhood In addition, the team has proposed a mission that is within budget based on heritage instruments satisfying the decadal survey requirements.

Available Array Energy 60297 W-hr Battery Recharge Energy Losses 93 W-hr Shunt Energy Losses 20% Battery W-hr 187 W-hr Remaining Electrical Energy 60017 W-hr Power Conversion Losses 80% Efficiency 12003 W-hr Harness Losses \(4 Available Diurnal Load Energy \(CBE Average Load Energy Supported 67.9 W Array Area 0.20 m2 12 specifically the seismometer and magnetometer continuously while other instruments such as the heat flow probes may operate intermittently. The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
