1st International Workshop on Data Analysis Patterns \nin Software Engineering \(DAPSE 2013 nMicrosoft Research, USA \ncbird@microsoft.com \nTim Menzies \nWest Virginia University, USA \ntim@menzies.us nThomas Zimmermann \nMicrosoft Research, USA \ntzimmer@microsoft.com \n \n \nAbstract—Data scientists in software engineering seek insight \nin data collected from software projects to improve software \ndevelopment. The demand for data scientists with domain \nknowledge in software development is growing rapidly and there \nis already a shortage of such data scientists. Data science is a \nskilled art with a steep learning curve. To shorten that learning \ncurve, this workshop will collect best practices in form of data \nanalysis patterns that is, analyses of data that leads to meaningful \nconclusions and can be reused for comparable data. In the nworkshop we compiled a catalog of such patterns that will help \nexperienced data scientists to better communicate about data \nanalysis. The workshop was targeted at experienced data \nscientists and researchers and anyone interested in how to \nanalyze data correctly and efficiently in a community accepted \nway.  \nIndex Terms—data science, software engineering, data mining, \npredictive analytics, business intelligence, machine learning, big \ndata, smart data, software analytics, software intelligence \nI. INTRODUCTION \nSoftware development generates an inordinate amount of \ndata. For example, check-ins, work items, and test executions nare recorded in software repositories such as CVS, Subversion, \nGIT, and Bugzilla. Telemetry data reflects how customers ex-\nperience software, which includes application and feature usage \nand exposes reliability Data scientists or researchers in soft-\nware engineering seek insight in data collected from software nprojects in an effort to improve software development. Many \ncompanies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft \nare actively working on becoming more data-driven in software \ndevelopment. The demand for data scientists with domain \nknowledge in software development is growing rapidly and \nthere is already a shortage of such data scientists. \nData science is a skilled art with a steep learning curve. To \nshorten that learning curve, this workshop collected best prac-\ntices in form of data analysis patterns, that is, analyses of data nthat leads to meaningful conclusions and can be reused for \ncomparable data. In the workshop we compiled a catalog of \nsuch patterns that will help experienced data scientists to better \ncommunicate about data analysis and also newcomers get up to \nspeed quickly and avoid common pitfalls. \nThe goals of the workshop were: \n? Build a community interested in sharing data science \nexpertise, for example by demonstrating data analysis, \nsharing of methodological decisions, setbacks encoun-\ntered, and insights into their analysis techniques.   \n? Compile a catalog of reusable data analysis patterns \nthat will be publicly available. \n Inform attendees regarding analysis techniques so that \nthey are able to better understand when and how to use nvarious data analysis techniques correctly and efficient-\nly in a community accepted way. \nThe workshop was targeted to anyone who is interested in \ndata analysis and wants to educate themselves in what analysis ntechniques are available and recommended. \n \nFor more information, please visit the workshop webpage nhttp://research.microsoft.com/dapse2013/ \nII. DATA ANALYSIS PATTERNS \nWe solicited short papers \(2-3 pages describing one or \nmore data analysis pattern. Authors should use the form that is \nmost suited to describe the pattern. Where possible, we encour-\nage authors to describe pattern in a similar way to the Gamma \net al design patterns book: \n? Pattern name: a handle for the pattern \n? Problem: when to apply the pattern \n Solution: how to apply the pattern \n? Discussion: results and trade-offs of applying the pat-\ntern, common mistakes in applying the pattern that \nshould be avoided, etc. \n? Examples: briefly summarize and/or cite example ap-\nplications of the pattern in literature, if possible, R \nsnippets or Weka code to apply the pattern, etc. \nFor illustrative purposes, we provided an example pattern \n\(see Figure 1 simplified form in the call for pa-\npers; for the workshop we expected discussion of patterns to be \nmore comprehensive. \n \nWe allowed two options for submitting a pattern:  \n? Archival Papers had to be submitted by the workshop \npaper deadline \(February 7, 2013 proceedings and the \nACM and IEEE Digital Libraries.  \n? Non-Archival Papers had a later deadline and were not npublished in the workshop proceedings and the ACM \nand IEEE Digital Libraries. \n \n978-1-4673-3076-3/13/$31.00 c© 2013 IEEE ICSE 2013, San Francisco, CA, USA\nWorkshop Summaries\n1517\nBoth archival and non-archival papers were reviewed by a \nprogram committee and accepted based on the clarity of the \ndescription and how broadly their proposed pattern might be \napplicable. Prior application of the pattern by the authors will \nnot be a requirement and this workshop is more interested in \nthe mechanics and choice of the data analysis than the impact \nof published results. \nIII.

key-value pairs mapped from the base table can \nbe discarded, which will result in the high effective process nin the shuffle/sort. Secondly, LeftBDM[9] algorithm is used \nto merge the delta table and the base table in reduce phase. \n \n111\n  \n1  whether an element is a member of a set. It consists of \nan array of m bits and k independent hash functions All bits \nin the array are initially set to 0. When an element x is added \nto a Bloom filter, the position hi x 1?i?k When y is judged whether y belongs to the \nset, the k hash functions are applied to y respectively. If all of nthe bits which are matched with the results of hi\(y 1?i?k element of \nthe set, otherwise y is not. \n \n \nFigure 1.  The Element Insertion of Bloom filter. \nIt can be seen that Bloom filter is the upgraded version of \nHash. And it is inserting and space efficiency.  \nHowever Bloom filter has its limitation. It may yield \nfalse positives, but false negatives are not generated nTherefore, Bloom filter is not suitable for those "zero error" \napplications. If low error rate can be tolerated in the \napplications, Bloom filter can significantly save much \nstorage space at the price of very few errors. \n2  table, and finally generate a what-if view. The \nmain steps are as follows: \nFirstly, Left join is used between the base table and the \ndelta table. And then the tuples from the result set should be \nchecked out according to the rules below. \nIf flag=’U’, the data from the base table and the delta \ntable should be merged into one; \nIf flag=’D’, then skip. \nFinally, union all the result sets and the tuples from delta \ntable which the column flag is marked as 'I'. And a new \nwhat-if view is generated. \nLeftBDM algorithm is used in both DistributedCacheDM \nalgorithm and BloomFilterDM algorithm in the paper. One is \nin the map phase and the other is in reduce phase. \n3 is much larger than that \nof delta table. Therefore, there are a large number of \nunnecessary key-value pairs mapped from the base table \nexist in the process of shuffle/sort, which will result in much \nunnecessary overhead. So, filtering the base table is required \nin advance. A Bloom filter [15] is a probabilistic data nstructure used to test whether an element is a member of a set \nrapidly, and it is suitable for filtering large data. This \nalgorithm generates a global Bloom filter during the first job, \nand then the filter is disseminated to every node when the \nsecond job is running. During the filtration, LeftBDM \nalgorithm [9] is partially optimized in the reduce phase. The \ncolumn flag of delta table is the only point to determine \nwhich tuple should be put into the view. \nThe steps of BloomFilter-based Delta Table Merging \nAlgorithm are as follows: \na job configuration, input and output files \nand so on. \nb tuple from the delta \ntable. Every record is mapped into a key-value pair, which \nthe join column is marked as key and the tuple as value. For \ninstance, in Figure 2, id is the column which is to be joint, \nand a bit in value is an identifier which represents the source \nof this tuple. The tuple will be marked as '1’ when it is from \ndelta table, and marked as '0' when it’s from base table. \n \nFigure 2.  First Map Phase \nc Construction  \nThe key-value pair generated by map function is divided \ninto several partitions. And the local filter is built by key in \neach partition. The construction of local filter is shown in \nFigure 3. \n \nFigure 3.  The Construction of Local Filter \n112\n  \nV = BloomFilterDM \(B, D in Section 3.1 \n    D: the delta table defined in Section 3.1 \nOutputs: \n    V: the what-if analysis view nProcess: \n    Initiate table D and I/O information for MapReduce \nJob-1: \nInputs: \n    D: the delta table defined in Section 3.1 \nOutputs: \n    bf: the instance of BloomFilter \nMap phase: \n    Add KEY to bf by algo described in Section 3.2.2 \nReduce phase: \n    Repeat: \n        bf union to VALUES \n    Until VALUES has no next \nJob-2: \nInputs: \n    B: the base table defined in Section 3.1 \n    D: the delta table defined in Section 3.1 \n    bf: the instance of BloomFilter generated by Job-1 \nOutputs: \n    V: the what-if analysis view \n Load bf to distributed cache and deliver it to every node \nMap phase: \n    If KEY not exist in bf \n        V VALUES  \n    Endif \nReduce phase: \n  Initiate del_pair<key, value> and base_ pair<key, value> \n    If neither del_pair nor ba_pair is null \nIf del_pair.value.flag = ‘U’ or del_pair.value.flag = ‘I’ \n    Then V del_pair.value \nElse del_pair.value.flag =’D’ \n    Then skip \nEndif \n   Endif\nd nJobtracker directs each tasktracker to merge all local \nfilters into a global filter. Now, the global filter is loaded into \ndistributed cache by jobtracker, and then will be sent to all \ntasktrakers. \ne Phase  \nNow, a second job is started. The tuples from both base \ntable and delta table are loaded in map phase. The tuples, \nwhich are filtered out by the global filter, are recorded into \nthe what-if view instead of being discarded. \nf delta table share a one-to-one mapping. It is \nimpossible to exist a many-to-one or one-to-many \nrelationship 


between them. Therefore, a Cartesian product or \ncross join will not happen. And we can deal with them just nby the flag from the delta table. \nThe flow chart of processing in reduce phase is shown in \nFigure 4. \n nFigure 4.  The Flow Chart of Reduce Phase in BloomFilterDM Algorithm  \nThe pseudo-code of BloomFilterDM algorithm is shown \nas in Figure 5. \nAs Bloom filter is an array of m bits and the size of it is \nfixed regardless of the number of the elements, it is space \nefficiency and will not occupy a lot of memory resources. \nEven no intermediate results will be generated by this \nalgorithm. But the only shortcoming is that the algorithm \ncannot be accomplished in the map-side completely, so it \nwill spend more time in shuffle/sort and reduce phase \ncompared with DistributedCacheDM. \n \n \nFigure 5.  The Pseudo-code of BloomFilterDM Algorithm \nC. DistributedCache-based Delta Table Merging \nAlgorithm  \nAlthough Bloom filter is very efficient, we should pay a \nprice for the efficiency. When the filter determine whether an \nelement belongs to a set, there's the chance that an element \nthat seemed exactly right turns out not, that is to say Bloom \nfilter may yield false positives, but false negatives are not \ngenerated [16]. So we cannot create a one-to-one mapping \nbetween all the tuples which are treated by the filter from \nbase table and delta table As a result, it will waste much \ntime in shuffle/sort and reduce phase. Hadoop provides a \nmechanism called the distributed cache. The distributed \ncache can contain small "background" data file [17] needed \nfor initialization or libraries of codes that may need to be \naccessed on all nodes in the cluster. Therefore, we delivered \nthe whole delta table to each node of the clusters by the \n113\n  \nV = DistributedCacheDM \(B, D nInputs: \n    B: the base table defined in Section 3.1 \n    D: the delta table defined in Section 3.1 nOutputs: \n    V: the what-if analysis view \nProcess: \nInitiate table D and I/O information for MapReduce nLoad D to distributed cache and deliver it to every node \nJob: \nInputs: \n    B: the base table defined in Section 3.1 \nOutputs: \n    V: the what-if analysis view \nInitiate hashmap by tuples in D \n    Repeat: \n r  D \n        If r.flag = ‘I’ \n            V  r \n        Endif \n    Until D has no next \nMap phase: \n    If KEY not exist in bf \n        V  VALUES \n    Else If hashmap \(KEY KEY Else If hashmap \(KEY LeftBDM algorithm \n[9] is partially optimized in the map phase. The column flag \nof delta table is the only point to determine which tuple \nshould be put into the view. In addition, the processing of \ngenerating the what-if view is accomplished in map phase \ncompletely. \nThe steps of distributed cache-based delta table merging \nalgorithm are as follows: \na a \ntasktracker such as job configuration, input and output files. \nb the delta table into distributed cache, \nand delivers them to all tasktrakers.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS \nIn order to compare the performance of the algorithms, \nall of the experiments are based on the standard SSB data set \n\(about 10G  two parts: \ndelta_ins and delta_del which store data for inserting, and \ndeleting respectively. It involves two main steps: propagate \nand refresh. In process of Propagate, it aggregates delta_ins \nand delta_del after taking the union of them, grouping by the \nsame group-by attributes as in the base table. The Refresh nfunction applies the changes represented in the delta table to \nthe base table, resulting in the generation of what-if view. \nFor each tuple in delta table, if it is in Fact table, the \nmeasures will be added by the delta values, and if the result \nis 0, the tuple will be discarded. However, the limitation for \nthis algorithm lies on that it can only make assumptions on \n114\n  \nmeasures, but poor performance can be achieved for the \ninstance updates of dimension. \n2  adding, deleting \nand updating operations for a tuple, this algorithm changes \nthe structure of delta table And then, left join is used \nbetween the base table and the delta table at the beginning of \nthe algorithm Every FLAG value in the temporary table is \nscanned before filtering. But the limitation of the algorithm nlies that large storage will be occupied by the temporary \ntable created by left join operation. \n3

With the big data, the traditional database \nlosts its advantage gradually. Therefore, in the condition of \nlarge data how to efficiently implement OLAP analysis has \ngreat significance.  The what-if algorithm based on the \nBloom filter and distributed cache is proposed in the paper. \nThe what-if algorithm based on Bloom filter uses the filter to \nfilter out unnecessary tuples in base table and completes the \ndelta table data merge algorithm in MapReduce phase which \nimproves the formation rate of what-if analysis view. What-\nif algorithm based on distributed cache uses a distributed \ncache mechanism to build hash map for completing filter \nconnection and make the delta table merge algorithm fully ncompleted in the map side. The experimental results show \nthat the algorithm based on Bloom filter and distributed \ncache has higher performance. With the need of enterprise-\nclass business constantly changing multi-user co-processing \nwill be needed in what-if analysis. The next step we will \nstudy what-if analysis query processing based on a multi-\nuser collaborative mode in big data. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Matteo,Golfarelli Stefano Rizzi, Andrea Proli.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
