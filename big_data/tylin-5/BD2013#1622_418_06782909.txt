Clustering is an important technique\nfor data analysis to ?nd the natural distribution of the unlabelled\ndata. Clustering algorithms need to store the entire data into\nmemory for analysis become infeasible when the data set is too\nlarge to be stored. To solve this problem, some approaches were\ndeveloped by different strategies. In this paper, we have studied\n?ve soft clustering algorithms for large data using a chunk style\nstrategy and evaluated their performances for different kinds of\ndata sets. Each approach handles large data by processing data\nchunk by chunk instead of handling the entire data set at a\ntime. Experimental results which show the effectiveness of these\napproaches are presented and discussed. The recommendations\nfor the usage of these approaches are also proposed.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nLarge data or big data becomes prevalent because the per-\nvasive computers and networks have reduced the cost of data\ncollection and distribution. For example, 2.5 billion content\nitems and 105 terabytes of data are posted in each half an hour\nin Facebook, and over 225 million users generate over 800\ntweets per second in Twitter. Analyzing large data and mining\nthe embedded valuable information are very important for the\norganizations who hold the data to increase their revenue [1].\nClustering is an unsupervised learning technique which\nplays an important role in data analysis. The task of clustering\nis to group a set of n objects into k clusters. Objects in the\nsame cluster are more similar to each other than objects in\ndifferent clusters. It is a promising data analysis tool to ?nd the\ndistribution and information underlining the unlabeled data. It\nhas been studied widely in the research ?elds of data mining,\nmachine learning and information retrieval. There is one way\nto classify clustering algorithms into hard clustering and soft\nclustering. In hard clustering, each object of data only belongs\nto one speci?c cluster, while each object belongs to more than\none clusters with different degree in soft clustering.\nHowever, clustering algorithms which need to store the\nentire data into memory become infeasible when the data set\nis too large to be stored. To deal with such kind of large\ndata, different clustering approaches with different strategies\nare proposed in the literature. For example, random sampling\nmethod is used in CLARA[2] and CURE[3]. In particular,\nin CLARA the medoids which are the representative objects\nfor clusters are identi?ed for a sample of the data. These\nmedoids of the sample are used to approximate the medoids\nof the entire data set. Multiple representative objects are\nidenti?ed for each cluster in CURE and random sampling\nmethod is also employed to handle large data. Data structure\nand summarization techniques are adopted in CLARANS[4]\nand BIRCH [5 respectively. In CLARANS the identi?cation\nof medoids is considered as searching in a graph in which\nevery node contains a set of medoids that represent the data\nset. Randomized search is used to determine the ?nal set of\nthe representative medoids. Data is clustered incrementally in\nBIRCH based on a in-memory balanced tree structure and\nsummarization techniques. Incremental clustering is also an\nimportant way to handle large data In [6], an incremental\nclustering algorithm for stream data based on k-Median called\nLSEARCH is developed using a chunk-oriented processing\nstyle. In [7], incremental spectral clustering algorithm is\ndeveloped to handle the large evolving data. Recently, two\napproaches [8], [9] based on approximation techniques are\nproposed for approximating kernel k means to solve large\nscale kernel clustering. The clustering approaches discussed\nabove are all based on hard clustering. Many of them have\nbeen extended to soft clustering approaches because soft\nclustering may capture the natural structure of the data sets\nmore precisely. In this study, we focus on ?ve soft clustering\nalgorithms for large data clustering which are single-pass\nFCM referred as SPFCM [10], online FCM called OFCM\n[11], history based online fuzzy c medoids\(HOFCMD, on-\nline fuzzy c medoids\(OFCMD  ONMF  The evaluation of their per-\nformances on various data sets is presented and discussed. In\nthe next section the ?ve approaches are brie?y reviewed.\nII. SOFT CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS FOR LARGE DATA\nA. SPFCM and OFCM\nSPFCM and OFCM are designed based on fuzzy c\nmeans\(FCM  objective function JFCM which is de?ned as\nfollows:\nJFCM =\nk?\nc=1\nn?\ni=1\numci?xi ? vc?\n2 1 number of\nclusters, n is the number of objects. uci is the membership of\nobject i in cluster c. vc is the centroid of cth cluster. ?xi?vc?\nis the distance between object i and vc, and Euclidean distance\nis always used in practice.\nSPFCM and OFCM use the same mechanism to handle\nlarge data which is processing the data chunk by chunk. Each\ncluster of a chunk is represented by an identi?ed centroid.\nEach centroid is the mean of the objects in a cluster, weighted\nby their degree of belonging to the cluster. The ?nal set of\ncentroids for 


the entire data set are identi?ed by weighted\nFCM\(wFCM the\ncentroids of the chunks. For SPFCM, the centroids identi?ed\nfrom the previous chunk are combined into next chunk and the\n?nal set of centroids for the entire data are generated after the\n?nal chunk is processed. While for OFCM, the identi?cation\nof centroids for every chunk is processed separately and the\n?nal set of centroids are identi?ed by one more step.\nNext, we review two incremental fuzzy c medoids clustering\nalgorithms which are extended from handling the large object\ndata sets to large relational data sets.\nB. HOFCMD and OFCMD\nIn 12], two methods named HOFCMD and OFCMD are\nproposed for large relational data sets. Compared with SPFCM\nand OFCM, the main difference is the way they select the\nrepresentative objects of a cluster. In SPFCM and OFCM,\nthe object which is called centroid is achieved by calculating\nthe mean of the objects in a cluster While in HOFCMD and\nOFCMD, the object named medoid is one of the objects in\na cluster. This difference makes SPFCM and OFCM always\nbe suitable for object data, and HOFCMD and OFCMD\nfor relational data. And medoids based methods have the\nadvantage of better interpretability by using medoids instead\nof centroids.\nThe incremental mechanism of HOFCMD and OFCMD is\nsimilar with SPFCM and OFCM respectively. Similar with\nwFCM, weighted fuzzy c medoids\(wFCMD xi, ?c 2 fuzzi?cation\nconstant, wi is the weight of object i, and ?c is the medoid\nfor cluster c. Dis\(xi, vc c? is the distance between\nobject xi and medoid ?c. In HOFCMD, the identi?ed weighted\nmedoids in previous chunk are combined with current chunk\nas history information. And ?nal k medoids are generated after\nprocessing the last chunk of data. In OFCMD, the ?nal c\nmedoids are identi?ed by applying wFCMD on the ensemble\nmedoids of all the chunks. The approach clusters all the chunks\nseparately and aggregates all the medoids of each chunk in the\nend.\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nx 105\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nx 105\nFig. 1: 2D15 synthetic data\nC. Online NMF\nNonnegative Matrix Factorization\(NMF  of machine learning and\ndata mining in recent years. NMF has widely been applied\nin the clustering area[16 The objective function for NMF to\nminimize is as follows:\nJNMF = ?X ? FG\nT ?2F \(3 Frobenius norm of matrix, X is the data\nmatrix, F = [f1, ..., fc] can be viewed as a matrix in which\neach column is considered as a cluster representative. gi is the\nith column of GT , and gij can be viewed as the possibility\nof object j belongs to cluster i. The two popular approaches\nfor solving the problem are multiplicative updating[17] and\nprojected gradient method[18]. However, these two approaches\nare unsuitable when the data set is very large. In [13], an online\nNMF\(ONMF large\ndata. The algorithm is able to process data by one point or one\nchunk at a time. When new data comes, a nonnegative least\nsquare\(NLS applied to calculate the cluster\nrepresentative matrix. There are two ways for applying ONMF\nalgorithm which are one pass and multi-pass. One pass means\nclustering results is achieved by processing the data only one\ntime, while multi-pass means the data need to be processed\nfor multiple times.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nA. Data Set\nThe following data sets are used to evaluate the performance\nof the algorithms.\n2D15 n=5000, k=15, d=2 data\nset. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the data.\nMNIST\(n=70000, k=10, d=784 data set. Each of them is a handwritten digital image which\nis one of the number among 0 to 9. There are totally 70000\n1This data set was designed by Ilia Sidoroff and can be downloaded on\nhttp://www.uef.?/en/sipu/datasets.\n2This data set can be downloaded on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.\nhandwritten images with resolution 28×28. The pixel value is\nnormalized to 0,1] by dividing 255. Each image is represented\nas 784 dimensional feature vector by concatenating each\ncolumn of the image.\nForest\(n=581012, k=7, d=54 and United State Forest Service and\nit has 7 classes, 581012 objects. Each cluster represents one\nkind of trees. Each object is represented as a 54 dimensional\nfeature vector which are the characteristics of land.\nB Experimental Methodology\n1 metrics F-measure, and Normalized\nMutual Information\(NMI results produced by an algorithm and the ground\ntruth. The higher the value of the metric is, the better the\nclustering result is. The value is equal to 1 only when the\nclustering result is same as the ground truth.\n2  initialization. The object whose\ndistance is minimum to all the other objects is selected as the\n?rst center/medoid. The remaining centers/medoids are iden-\nti?ed successively as the objects that maximize their minimal\ndistances with the selected centers/medoids. The strategy helps\nthe identi?ed centers/medoids distribute evenly in the data\nspace to avoid the convergence to a bad local optimum. Note\nthat, for ONMF, the 


identi?ed objects are formed as a matrix\nto initialize the cluster representative matrix F. The procedure\nof the initialization is as follows:\nInitialization Procedure\nSet the number of clusters k,\nCalculate the ?rst center/medoid:\np = arg min1?j?n\nn?\ni=1\nDis\(xj , xi 1;\nRepeat\nm = m+ 1\np = arg max1?i?n;xi ?Vmin1?c?|V |Dis\(vc, xi vm};\nUntil\(m=k sizes as 1%, 2.5%,\n5%, 10% and 25% of the size of data set. For Forest data set,\nlimited by the memory of computer, smaller percentages are\nused which are 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1% and 2.5%. 20 trials\nexperiments are run for each approach. To see the robustness\nof them, the order of input data is randomized in each trial.\nWe calculate the mean, standard deviation, minimum and max-\nimum of the value of F-measure and NMI over 20 trials. The\nmean value re?ects the average performance of the clustering\nalgorithm. The standard deviation minimum and maximum\n3This data set can be downloaded on\nhttp://uisacad2.uis.edu/dstar/data/clusteringdata.html.\nvalue over the 20 trials re?ect the robustness of the clustering\nalgorithm to the order of the data. For SPFCM, OFCM and\nONMF, the input data is the original object data. One pass and\ntwo pass of ONMF are applied on the data sets. For HOFCMD\nand OFCMD, the input data is the distance/relational matrix\nwhich is calculated from object data. The experiments were\nexecuted on a PC with four cores of Intel I5-2400 with 8\ngigabytes of memory.\nC. Results and Discussions\nThe F-measure and NMI results of the ?ve approaches\non the three data sets are showed in Table. I and Table. II\nrespectively. The bold results are the best results for each\nchunk size. We notice that the performance of ONMF on 2D15\nis not satisfactory and hence the results are not presented.\nIn the experiment, it is showed that the cluster representative\nis updated far beyond the numerical range of the data. The\nphenomenon may be caused by two reasons. One reason\nis that ONMF only considers the updating on non-negative\nvalues, but the reasonable range of each updating result is not\nconsidered. The other reason is that each object in 2D15 is\ntwo dimension and the cluster number is 15 which is much\nlarger than the dimension. This situation may degenerate the\naccuracy of the updating. Although the performance of ONMF\nis not good on 2D15 data, the performance is much better\non MNIST and Forest data sets. For the baseline, we apply\nkmeans on 2D15 data for 20 times. The average F-measure\nand NMI results are 0.8839 and 0.9356, respectively. The\nresults in Table. I and Table. II show that the four incremental\napproaches outperforms kmeans.\nTable. I\(a OFCM,\nOFCMD and HOFCMD on low dimensional 2D15 data set. It\nis showed that the four algorithms have generally comparable\nresults with each other. And their performance varies accord-\ning to different chunk sizes. Table I\(b achieves the best results on all different\nchunk sizes. OFCM shows lower performance when the chunk\nsize is small, especially when the chunk size is 1%. The\nresults on Forest data are showed in Table. I\(c and\nHOFCMD perform slightly better than SPFCM and OFCM\nand two pass ONMF gets the best result when chunk size is\n2.5%. The NMI results in Table. II show the similar pattern\nas the results of F-measure. Note that although the results are\npoor on these two data sets, they are still comparable to the\nresults of kmeans on the same data sets presented in [9].\nAccording to the empirical study of above approaches for\nlarge data clustering, we summarize our recommendations for\nusing these approaches. First of all, if the type of data set\nis relational HOFCMD and OFCMD should be used because\nthe other three can not handle relational data. If the data set\nis object data, all the studied approaches can be applied while\nfor HOFCMD and OFCMD the data needs to be transformed\nto relational form ?rstly. Then if the data is low dimension\nwith many clusters, ONMF is not suggested to use.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the clustering approaches for large data\nclustering especially incremental or online clustering methods\nare reviewed . We compared ?ve representative soft clustering\napproaches for large data. Compared to the conventional\nclustering that need to handle the entire data at a time, the\napproaches treat data as chunk by chunk to avoid the problem\nof infeasibility to load the data entirely. The experimental\nresults of the approaches on different data sets are presented\nand discussed We also provide the recommendations for\nusing the approaches in different scenarios according to our\nempirical study.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

Classi?cation accuracies of deep SPN, SAC [12 11], and MAC [2]. The ?rst three rows are on the unoccluded test set, and the last three are on\nthe occluded test set.\nwith the separate attribute classi?ers \(SAC  MAC 2] on both the\nunoccluded and occluded testing images. The SAC trains a\nbinary SVM classi?er for each attribute. The original MAC\nis to predict human attribute based on poselets. We apply\nit to faces by replacing the poselets with our discriminative\nregions in Sec.2 and then train different level of classi?ers\nas in [2 Note that MAC can model pairwise attribute\ncorrelations.\nThe results are reported in Table 1. On the unoccluded\ntest, the averaged classi?cation accuracies of SAC, MAC,\nand deep SPN are 82.1%, 84.4%, and 87.9 respectively,\nwhile the corresponding accuracies on the occluded test set\nare 68.0%, 72.1%, and 79.8%. The deep SPN generally\nperforms better especially with the presence of occlusions,\nbecause it effectively models the high-order correlations\nbetween attributes and regional classi?ers. On the occluded\ntest set, the deep SPN signi?cantly outperforms SAC and\nMAC on nearly all the attributes, because SAC assumes\nindependence between attributes, while MAC can only\nmodel pairwise correlation. We also examine our SPTs\nalone. The averaged accuracies are 81.9% and 70.2%\nof the unoccluded and occluded tests, respectively, which\nindicate their performances can be signi?cantly improved\nwhen organizing them into the deep SPN. Moreover, it takes\n2 hours to train our deep SPN on two 3.3 GHz CPUs and\n16G RAMs, and 5.3 seconds to classify 73 attributes of an\nimage which is comparable to 5 seconds of MAC in the\nsame experimental environment.\nIII. Experiments on synthetic datasets. We evaluate\nthe robustness of deep SPN under different levels of\nocclusions on a synthetic dataset We use the same training\nand unoccluded test sets as in parts I and II. However,\nfor each sample in the test set, a series of corrupted\nimages are generated with the following strategy. We\n?rst generate random noise that covers the whole image,\nand then gradually reduce the coverage of noise towards\none of the four directions: “Top to Bottom”, “Bottom to\nTop”, “Left to Right”, and “Right to Left”. An example\nof generating occluded images along the “Right to Left”\ndirection is shown in Fig.8.\nFig.8 plots the classi?cation accuracies of the deep SPN\nwhen the percentage of visible image region is increased\nfrom 10% to 80%. At 50 visibility, all the accuracies are\nover 75% \(random guess is 50 few attributes need to be observed in\norder to infer the others. As plotted at the left of Fig.9, we\naverage the accuracies of the four directions and compare\nwith SAC and MAC. Our method clearly shows superior\nperformance, showing that our method is more robust when\nlarge occlusions are present.\n2870\nFigure 8 Classi?cation accuracies of deep SPN under different levels of\nocclusions.\nFigure 9. We compare our deep SPN with SAC [12] and MAC [2] under\ndifferent levels of occlusions.\n6. Conclusion\nThis paper has proposed a facial attribute estimation\nframework, where attribute estimation is achieved by\ncombining discriminative decision trees with a SPN. For\nrobust attribute estimation, we devise a deep architecture to\ncapture attribute correlations for the SPN, where occlusion\nhandling is casted as marginalizing the variables of the\nundetected regions. Experimental results on both occluded\nand unoccluded images show great improvement and indi-\ncate that our method is very robust under different levels of\nocclusions. As face attributes are becoming more important\nfor face recognition, in the future work, we will explore the\nadvantage to combine face attributes with traditional face\nrecognition approaches [23, 24, 3, 26].\nReferences\n[1] A.

between the MSL flight computer and the Electra-\nLite UHF Transceiver that resulted in constraints on nallowable command data product size and development of a \ncomplex buffer management system to avoid truncating \ndownlink frames.  While operational workarounds were \nultimately identified, these idiosyncrasies resulted in more \ncomplex ground processes and delayed other critical relay \ntests.  Future missions should ensure early and thorough \ndocumentation and validation of the end-to-end relay data \npath. \nVerification Validation \(V&V including during the cruise phase of the mission.  \nWhile these were addressed prior to arrival at Mars, and nactual surface operations have proceeded smoothly, it would \nhave been desirable to identify these issues earlier.  The \nchallenge here, which is common to the previous \nexperiences with MER and PHX, is that the testing timeline \nis dictated by the lander mission’s V&V test program and \ntestbed accessibility.  The Mars Exploration Program may \nneed to establish more formal guidelines for the scope and \nschedule of testing related to verification and validation of \nrelay services, and ensure that all missions develop their test nschedules and corresponding resource profiles to meet those \nguidelines. \nEnd-to-End Relay Testbeds:  The fidelity of the end-to-end \ntestbeds for relay system testing can play a significant role \nin the overall success of the V&V test campaign.  For the \nMSL-MRO link, both the orbiter and lander projects had \nhigh fidelity spacecraft testbeds resident at JPL, with \nEngineering Models of the Electra and Electra-Lite ntransceivers, and with flight-like representations of the \nspacecraft Command & Data Handling \(C&DH subsystem.  \nWhile these testbeds were located at separate sites within \nthe JPL campus, fiber optic links supported signal flow \nbetween them, as well as integration of a high-fidelity link \nchannel simulator capable of emulating realistic time \nvariation of link amplitude, frequency, and delay, enabling \nthorough end-to-end data flow testing over a range of flight-\nlike signal conditions.  For ODY and MEX, however, each \norbiter project had only a portable test set available at JPL to \nsupport cross-project testing with MSL, each with a flight-\nlike UHF transceiver but with lower fidelity representations \nof the orbiter C&DH.  This limited the scope of ground \ntesting possible on the MSL-ODY and MSL-MEX links.  \nThis, combined with some non-flight-like aspects of the \nODY test set that were discovered late in the V&V test \ncampaign, resulted in the deferral of full validation and use \nof the MSL-ODY forward link capability until well after \nlanding.  The conclusions here are that high-fidelity testbeds \nincrease the robustness of end-to-end relay testing; when \nprogrammatic considerations limit the test hardware fidelity, \nit is essential to clearly document and assess any non-flight-\nlike aspects of the testbed infrastructure. \nElectromagnetic Interference:  Uncertainty in the MRO nEMI environment resulted in significant concern prior to \nMSL arrival as to whether Curiosity would be able to \nachieve the desired 250 Mb/sol data return via the MRO \nrelay path.  This resulted in a large amount of MRO flight \nand ground testing to attempt to better quantify the EMI \nimpacts as a function of Electra return link frequency.  It \nalso drove the need for a lengthy commissioning phase \nduring the first few months of MSL surface operations, to \ncarefully monitor performance as each MRO science \ninstrument was powered on Electra’s frequency-agility \nturned out to be an important tool in mitigating the EMI \nimpacts.  In hindsight earlier and more thorough flight \ntesting could have provided more confidence in the \npredicted MRO relay performance; however, such testing \nwould have required interruption of ongoing MRO science \nobservations Ultimately, future missions will want to \naddress EMI issues earlier in the spacecraft/instrument \ndevelopment cycle to identify and mitigate any spurious \nemissions prior to launch. \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nNASA’s ODY and MRO orbiters and ESA’s MEX orbiter \nembody an international network of Mars relay orbiters, \nproviding essential telecommunication services to the Mars \nScience Laboratory mission.  All three orbiters provided ncomplementary coverage of MSL’s EDL, acquiring tracking \nand telemetry data from MSL’s UHF transmission that ncould have provided essential information for fault \nreconstruction had a mission-ending anomaly occurred nduring EDL.  Since landing, ODY and MRO are providing \nthe highest levels of data return yet achieved for a Mars \nlander, with over 45 Gb of Curiosity data returned over the \nfirst 90 sols of the surface mission.

the?Vdeorbit is computed based on a change of\nsemimajor axis from the current circular orbit to an elliptical\norbit that has the perigee at 0km and the apogee at the orbit\naltitude:\n?Vdeorbit,drag = ?V \(r, r RE , r, r 23 semimajor axis from the\ncurrent circular orbit to an elliptical orbit that has the same\nperigee and a slightly higher apogee:\n?Vdeorbit,SRP = ?V \(r, r, r, r + ?h, r 24 are due to the GEO restricted zone, the\n35km are to allow for gravitational perturbations, and the\nremaining margin depends on the magnitude of the effect of\nsolar radiation pressure on the spacecraft \(the larger the ef-\nfect, the larger the margin the spacecraft.\nOnce the ?V has been calculated, it is possible to compute\nthe propellant mass required to satisfy this ?V budget. The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators. The mass\nof the sensors is driven by the attitude knowledge accuracy\nrequirement acc \(Equation 26 satisfy by the momentum storage h required \(Equation 27 26 27 that acc can vary depending on the architecture, as the\npointing requirements of a high gain antenna, or an optical\npayload, are very different from those of a low gain antenna.\nConcerning the momentum storage h, it is assumed to be\nsized to counter the different disturbance torques produced by\natmospheric drag, gravity gradient, solar radiation pressure,\nor the Earth’s magnetic field. Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload.

For instance, the mass of the ADCS depends\non the mass of the spacecraft, which obviously depends on the\nmass of the ADCS. Thus, a set of convergence criteria need\nto be defined.

The study consists of a\nstakeholder analysis to identify the primary stakeholders and\ntheir needs, and the development of a computational tool to\nexplore the architectural tradespace.\nSeveral interviews have been conducted with experts at\nNASA to elicit the potential requirements on SCaN from\ndifferent user communities.\nThe major architectural decisions to be made by the SCaN\nprogram have been identified and encoded in a mathematical\nmodel. A computational tool has been developed that can\nautomatically enumerate and evaluate thousands of different\nSCaN architectures. This tool contains both a performance\nand a cost model.\nNext Steps\nThe next steps include calibration of the optical link budget\ncalculations, comparisons of the network scheduling calcula-\ntions with historical TDRSS load data, and validation of the\nspacecraft sizing algorithm with real TDRS data. Following\nthe completion of the stakeholder analysis, the tool will be\nbe used to explore the architectural tradespace and identify\na subset of preferred architectures worth studying in more\ndetail.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
