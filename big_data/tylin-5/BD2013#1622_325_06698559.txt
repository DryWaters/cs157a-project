The key functionality of the smart meter is the capture \nand transfer of data relating to the consumption \(electricity, gas such as power quality and meter status. Such \ncapability has also resulted in the generation of an unprecedented \ndata volume, speed of collection and complexity, which has \nresulted in the so called big data challenge. To realize the hidden \nvalue and power in such data, it is important to use the \nappropriate tools and technology which are currently being \ncalled advanced analytics. In this paper we define a smart \nmetering landscape and discuss different technologies available \nfor harnessing the smart meter captured data. Main limitations \nand challenges with existing techniques with big data are also \nhighlighted and several future directions in smart metering are \npresented.  \nKeywords—Advanced Metering Infrastructure \(AMI Data Mining; Analytics; Big Data; Stream Analytics \nI. INTRODUCTION\nAdvanced metering Infrastructure \(AMI smart meters are \nbeing installed in homes and other premises in many regions \nof the world. USA and Europe have been deploying smart \nmeters for a number of  years while other regions in the world \nsuch as Australia and Canada have also started deployment in \nthe last few years. Millions of smart meters have been in use nwhile many more are being installed around the world. \nAccording to a recent report [1], due to deployments in 35 \nemerging countries from Central/Eastern Europe, Eurasia, \nLatin America, Middle East/North Africa South Africa and \nSoutheast Asia, the smart meter numbers will more than \ndouble in 2013 compared to 2012. A smart meter records the \nconsumption of electricity in intervals of less than an hour \n\(usually half hour communicates that to the electricity \nutility. Therefore compared to a traditional mechanical meter \nwhich keeps a record of accumulated electricity consumption, \nsmart meters capture almost real time consumption resulting \nin many potential advantages. In addition smart meters offer \nthe possibility of both local and remote meter reading, \nremotely controlling and limiting throughput, accommodate \ndistributed generation and the ability to record other \ncommodity meters on the premises. Due to these features \nsmart meters are expected to provide a number of advantages \nincluding lower cost of metering, energy savings for \ncustomers detection of energy theft, increased reliability in \nsupply and the possibility of variable and customised pricing \nschemes.  \nAccording to [2], a meter is called ‘smart’ or intelligent due \nto the following main functions. It can measure the electricity \nusage, remotely control the consumption of electricity and nremotely switch off supply when required. In addition there \ncould be a visual, real time display showing electricity \nconsumption and related information. These functions are \nbased on the hardware, networking and smart grid aspects of \nsmart meters. The new technologies can provide the utilities \nwith useful capabilities for forecasting demand, capturing as \nwell as influencing customer usage patterns, preventing \noutages and improved unit commitment. The technology also \nresults in the generation of an unprecedented deluge of data nwith massive volumes, arriving as fast changing streams of \ndata and of diverse and complex structure thus fitting in with \nthe key elements in the definition of what is being called big \ndata; volume, velocity and variance. It is not only the data \ncollected with smart meters, but other related data such as \nweather data customer information and feedback, scada \nhistory, which taken together makes the smart metering a big \ndata problem. The ability to integrate such data for analysis, \nmonitor, process and respond close to real time is necessary to \naddress the  issues and benefit from the opportunities created.  \nTherefore the smart grid and smart meters open up \nunprecedented opportunities in terms of business for utility \ncompanies but also present huge challenges in successful \nhandling and management of big data, to achieve these \nbenefits. To manage and use such information to gain insight \ntraditional, especially statistics based, analytics techniques \nalone are insufficient. Therefore utility companies must have \nthe capability of using advanced analytics across a variety of \ninformation about consumers, consumption, behavior of the \ngrid, generation capacities and weather 25]. The term \nadvanced analytics refer to a number of techniques which \ninclude a combination of data mining and knowledge discovery \ntools, machine learning technologies, advanced database and \nquery technologies as well as statistics based techniques.  \n978-1-4799-1135-1/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 40\n  In this paper we focus on smart metering’ with advanced \nanalytics. Smarter smart metering will require satisfactory \nsolutions for the big data problems, which will require \ntechnology for capturing measurements, converting these to \ndata transforming such data to knowledge and making such \nknowledge available for faster and better decisions [10 This \npaper looks at these key aspects of smart metering and provides \nthe relationship between these as 


phases within a bigger \nprocess.  A smart metering landscape is defined which is used \nas a base for identifying the data, technologies and related \nstakeholders for achieving metering intelligence. The rest of nthe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the \nbackground consisting of the current smart metering process, \nwhich leads to section 3 where a smart metering landscape is \ndefined. Section 4 presents the smart metering as a big data \nchallenge. Section 5 looks at the advanced analytics techniques \ncurrently being used for smart metering and identifies \nlimitations of existing technologies when faced with big data nchallenges. Possible solutions are also discussed. Section 6 \nconcludes the paper and presents potential future directions in \nadvanced analytics to address the current issues with smart \nmeter big data. \nII BACKGROUND\nA. The Current Smart Metering Process \nAlthough there are smart meters of varying technology and ndesign, there is a common overall process for data collection, \ncommunication, analysis, leading to decision support. Since \nthis process and the data collected and communicated is a vital \naspect of smart metering, we describe the process in some \ndetail below.  \nFigure 1: The Smart Metering Process [3] \nThere are some variations according to deployment in \ndifferent countries and regions, but the general smart metering nprocess is shown in figure 1 [3]. The smart meter gathers data \nlocally and transfers via a Local Area Network \(LAN and event data. Usage data refers \nto the actual electricity usage measured in Kilo Watt Hours \n\(KWH is read and transmitted in regular intervals; \nfor example, every 15 minutes to half an hour according to the nparticular deployment. The event information captured and \nrelayed by smart meters includes real time device status, \npower quality information and meter status information which \ncould be used to improve the business processes of the utility \n[4]. The issues faced with data collection and the implications \nand techniques for making use of this data are further \ndiscussed in detail in the next sections of this paper. \nThere could be some data processing carried out at the local \ncollection points, but their key function is to transfer the data \nto the utilities’ central collection center. This is carried out via \na Wide Area Network \(WAN data collected at the utility \nis used for a number of business purposes such as billing, \nnetwork and service monitoring, profiling, prediction and \nplanning.  \nB. Technology Features and Capabilities of Smart Meters nThe worldwide interest and the massive investment is smart \nmeter deployment has resulted in many anticipated benefits \nfrom such meters. The anticipation of benefits have arisen due \nto the capabilities of smart meters and therefore to understand \nthese anticipated benefits, it is important to relate these to the \ncapabilities of smart meters. Since the capabilities result from \nfeatures of smart meters, we discuss smart meter features, \ncapabilities and anticipated benefits, in that order, below. \n      There are a number of technology features which result in \na meter being categorized as a smart meter. Initially it was the nfunctionality of measuring the electricity used and/or \ngenerated and the ability to remotely control the supply and \ncut off when necessary.  Over the last few years, these \nfunctionalities have evolved with new technology and user \nrequirements. Initially these meters were called Automated \nMeter Reading \(AMR used one-way communication. \nThese were capable of automated monthly reads, one way \noutage \(or last gasp tamper detection and simple load \nprofiling. Over time the AMR capability was extended into \nshort term interval \(hourly upgrade \nof functionality occurred after integration of the meters with \ntwo-way communication technology which was called \nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure \(AMI based rates, remote \nprogramming, power quality measure and a dashboard type \nuser interface for real time usage monitoring. Although the \nterm smart meter started to be used only after the smart grid \ninitiatives, it can be seen that the features and functionality of \nthe meters evolved from the manually read meters of the past \nto the AMIs’ with dashboard interfaces and two way \ncommunication capability. It is this evolution of the \ntechnology which laid the foundation for smart metering using \nadvanced analytics, which is the focus of the paper.  \n      An electricity meter must have a number of capabilities to \nachieve the status of a smart meter. It is these capabilities that \nthat make it possible to realize the benefits from smart meters \nwhich have triggered the world wide interest and investment \nin smart meter systems. The key capabilities are [5]: x Real time or near real time capture of electricity \nusage and possibly distributed generation. x Providing the possibility of remote and local reading \nof the meter x Remote controllability of the meter enabling control nand even cut off of supply  x Possibility of linking to other commodity supply \n\(gas, water capture events such as device status, power \nquality \nBased on the smart metering process and the technology nfeatures we identify the key factors which influence metering \nintelligence. We use these factors to define a smart metering \nlandscape which could be used as the foundation for \npositioning the different advanced analytics activities carried \nout and also identify areas where further work could be \nconcentrated.  \nIII 


THE SMART METERING LANDSCAPE\nA number of factors need to be considered when defining \nsmart metering. Based on the capabilities outlined previously, \ndata collected could be used in a number of useful applications \nfor different stakeholders. Although the features and \ncapabilities of the meter will be a constraint on the type of \ndata and frequency of collection, there is the flexibility of \nconverting and transforming the available data using advanced \nanalytics to suit diverse needs.  \n      Many researchers and practitioners have carried out tasks \nwhich could be branded as smart metering or contributing to \nmetering intelligence, but there has been no accepted \nframework relating and positioning this fragmented work. \nDeveloping such a structured approach will:  x help to position a particular piece of work within the \noverall smart metering space,  x indicate what techniques are related to a particular \napproach and how,  x provide guidance on possible different approaches in \nachieving metering intelligence,  x help technology experts and researchers identify gaps \nin smart metering technology space  \nTo develop a smart metering strategy based on such a \nstructured approach, the key factors to be considered are: data, \nstakeholders and applications. The data aspect is made up of \nthe types of data collected and possible to be collected by the \nmetering infrastructure, possible frequency of collection and \ndata transfer capabilities. There are several stakeholder \ncategories such as consumers, retailers, suppliers and the type \nof data and the applications differ for different stakeholders nThe applications refer to stakeholder requirements which \ncould be satisfied by some form of transformation and \nmanipulation of the data collected.  \n      Capturing accurate and relevant data in a timely manner is nan essential foundation for metering intelligence. Capturing \ndata includes the collection, transfer and storage \n\(accumulation and events data [4], \n[5]. Measurement data are the more predictable and regular \nconsumption data. With smart meters this could be time-\ninterval consumption data as well as aggregated values for \nbilling purposes. Time interval data provides more granular \ndata opening up possibilities of for trend and cycle analysis \nand different time of day consumption analysis. Time interval \nbased consumption also enables to profile consumer behavior \nand relate consumption to temperature changes. Events and \nalerts are unscheduled, occurring randomly due to unusual \nsituations [5]. It is this diverse and large volumes of data \ncaptured by the smart meters which enable the use of \nadvanced analytics to achieve smart metering.\n      The key factors of data stakeholders and applications can \nbe put together to define the smart metering landscape which \nprovides a foundation for putting together a formal strategy for \nmetering intelligence.  \nFigure 2: The Smart Metering Landscape \nWe use data as the base for developing a structured \nmethodology. We consider two key approaches data driven \nand user driven approaches to smart metering activities. In \nfigure 2, the two approaches are shown with arrows pointing \ntowards the direction of outcome and benefit. The approaches \ncapture the range of activities which could be grouped under \nmetering intelligence, some of which are initiated due to the \nnew capabilities and functionality of smart metering \ninfrastructure and the others initiated by stakeholders. The two \napproaches could be distinguished by the questions a diverse needs of \nmultiple stakeholders ? b needs of diverse applications \nand stakeholders.  \nIV. SMART METERING AND BIG DATA\nBig data is a term that is currently widely being used in the \ndata gathering and analytics space [25]. Big data has many \nmeanings and interpretations but there are three key features \nthat are highlighted; volume, velocity and variance. Data ncaptured by smart meters clearly relate to all these features \nthus satisfying the definition for big data For example,  \nmoving from one meter reading per month to smart meter \nreadings every 30 minutes transforms into 48 million readings \nfor every million consumers, resulting in a massive volume of \ndata to manage. The data is collected in frequent time periods \nand if technology is available for near real time analysis, many nadvantages could be achieved. The analytics technologies will \nhave to deal with not only consumption data but information \nabout consumers, weather as well as many grid behavior based \nreadings. To manage and use this information to gain insight, \nutility companies must be capable of managing high-volume \ndata and using advanced analytics to transform data into \nactionable insights [5].  \nTherefore utilities are realizing the need of increased attention \non business intelligence and advanced analytics to support \n42\ndata-driven decision making and planning. The availability of \nlarge volumes of data collected in steady streams as well as \nother ad-hoc occurrences such as power outages and from \nmany regions and localities, makes it essential to have \nanintegrated view of company data and alignment of data \nacross disparate operational groups and lines of business. \nUtilities that build up this capability can gain insight into their \noperations and assets, enabling them to take proactive action \nrather than simply reacting to events after they happen. As nhighlighted in [25] the results may include increased \nprofitability, a reduced carbon footprint, increased safety, \nenhanced regulatory interaction and improved customer \nsatisfaction. Although the increase in volume 


especially in \nconsumption data capture is the most highlighted big data \naspect with smart meters the other key aspects of velocity and \nvariance are equally important. Velocity refers to the speed \nrequirement for collecting, processing and using the data. This \nis more relevant for data generated by sensors and new grid ninstrumentation. Although  analytical algorithms which can \nprocess huge quantities of data is available many of these are \nnot able to complete such activities in a sufficiently short time \nperiod to be of practically useful in smart grid environments. \nFor example in  real-time tasks such as equipment reliability \nmonitoring outage prevention or security monitoring, \novernight is not good enough [25]. Although several research \nlevel techniques have been reported on analyzing streaming \ndata, much work still needs to be done in making these ncommercially viable [29], [30]. Variety signifies the \nincreasing array of data types, which are collected not only \nfrom traditional sources like industrial control systems but \nalso from security cameras; weather forecasting systems, \nmaps, drawings and pictures; and the web. The variety of data \nis likely to become increasingly important to utilities as they \nbegin to analyze social media and call center dialogues and to nintegrate such information in to smart meter and grid \ngenerated data as part of their decision-making and planning \nprocesses.  \n       \nV. TECHNOLOGIES FOR SMART METERING\nAs discussed previously, there are two key types of data \ncollected by smart meters, namely consumption data and event \ndata and the data collected can be called big data due to their \nvolume, velocity and variance. A number of tools and \ntechnologies have been used to generate value and harness the \npower from such collected data. As shown in the smart \nmetering landscape there are two main approaches. In the first \ncase, the question could be asked: how can this collected data \nand infrastructure be used to gain some benefit for various \nstakeholders? Although the stakeholder needs are considered, \nthey are not the drivers of the activities. Traditionally this is \ncalled exploratory analytics and tools such as clustering, \nvisualization and unsupervised machine learning techniques \nare utilized [6]. In the second case  current knowledge of \nstakeholder needs, business needs government policies, social \nand environmental trends \(privacy, green house effects etc The activities initiated in this approach \nwill have a known objective. In data mining and machine \nlearning terminology such activities are called directed, and \nuse supervised learning tools such as classification decision \ntrees, artificial neural networks [7]. \n      Majority of the metering intelligence related analytics \nwork reported uses time varying power consumption data to \ngenerate consumption \(or load showing the \nconsumers usage behavior.  Clustering usage patterns makes it \npossible to identify typical behaviors called typical load \nprofiles \(TLP    estimation [11], load control [16], abnormal \nelectricity consumption detection [12], designing electricity ntariff offers [13], developing market strategies [14] or demand \nside response policy [15]. As in figure 3 clustering based load \nprofiles provide the base for several other key analytics \napplications which are described below. \nFigure 3: Consumer data analysis \nA. Consumer Profiling, Segmentation and Cluster Analysis nCluster analysis of smart meter data has been reported from a \nnumber of regions around the world. Cluster analysis aims at \ndiscovering structures in large data sets. The k means algorithm \nand a combination of k-means and artificial neural networks such \nas self-organizing maps are popular approaches for the clustering nand have been used in load profiling [11]. A study of German \nelectricity consumers by Flath et.al [10 highlights the \nadvantages of cluster analysis in identifying consumer groups \nfor targeted service innovation by utilities and retailers. They \nhave also suggested the value of incorporating cluster analysis \nas part of the utilities business intelligence systems such that \nprocess innovation and customer portfolio management could \nbe guided by the results. Cluster analysis has been conducted \non data separated by season and by weekdays and weekends \ndue to differing usage patterns. A study reported in [15] \nidentifies customer signatures based on usage readings from \n50 meters. Daily energy consumption plots yield information \nsuch as minimum, average, and maximum daily energy \nconsumption, as well as changes in daily energy use from \nwhich one can derive information such as household \noccupancy and occupant activities. This highlights privacy as \na key concern with profiling usage patterns and it has been \n43\nsuggested that statistical representations of the data be used \nrather than actual consumer information. A SOM [22] based \nclustering of 12,000 Finnish electricity consumers has been \nreported in [16]. The study carried out using Viscovery \nSOMine tool has suggested that understanding customer usage \npatterns can help design better demand response tariffs \nschemes The SOM has been used in several other studies as a \ntool for clustering electricity consumption data [17 18, [19]. \nA study by Abreu et al uses pattern recognition techniques to \ncapture habitual behaviour of consumers using smart meter \nreadings [20]. The work based on a new data mining algorithm \nfor finer profiling 21], proposes that such fine grained \nprofiling can be used to provide tailor made forecasts for \nhouseholds Zhang et.al [8] has used clustering techniques to \nidentify load profiles for large electricity uses in a 


Chinese \nprovince. This work differs from the previously stated since \nthey compare 3 well known clustering techniques, K means, \nFuzzy cMeans and SOM.   \nB. Load Forecasting  \nLoad forecasting is one of the most valuable analytics \napplications for the smart grid and the availability of time \ninterval data has made it possible to forecast in the short term \nand with high accuracy. Accurate forecasts are important for \ndeciding short-term operations as well as mid-term \nscheduling, but also decision makers need to have an \nunderstanding about the customers they have to supply for \nlong-term planning. Many applications of load forecasting \nhave been described in literature where several statistical and \nmachine learning technologies have been utilized For short \nand medium term forecasting, time series analysis and neural \nnetworks have been used [21], [22 23]. A problem with \nshort term forecasting models has been the loss of \nunderstanding about the bigger picture, which requires and \nunderstanding about the different categories of consumers. In \n[24], a Principle Component Analysis \(PCA ncategories. In [17], a hybrid system of SOMs and Support \nVector Machines \(SVM mid-term \nelectricity load. The SOM is used to separate electricity \nconsumption data into two groups which are then fed into a \nSVM in a supervised manner for load prediction. In [18], \nEspinoza et al reports on short term forecasting with hourly \nload data from a Belgian grid substation highlighting that \nforecasting and customer profiling are inter-related and \nproposed a unified framework which incorporates both. The \ninitial modelling is based on seasonal time series analysis, \nusing the Periodic Auto-regression \(PAR  which \nhave been used in modelling of electricity prices[20]. The \nstationary properties obtained from these models are run \nthrough a K-means clustering process to capture different \ncustomer profiles.  \nC. Pricing Intelligence \nSmart meter data can be used to analyze and plan different rate \nstructures, while adhering to requirements such as revenue \nneutrality or non-discrimination against low-income \ndemographics or the elderly. This has been called ‘time of use’ \nor dynamic pricing. Advanced statistical analysis, such as ncluster analysis, is needed for market segmentation. While real \ntime stream analysis of consumption is required make such a \nscheme practical. The benefits of dynamic pricing have been \nidentified as demand reduction, cost reduction and economic \nefficiency gain [26].  Prepay is another possible pricing nintelligence technique with the advantages of being familiar to \nconsumers, helps utilities limit credit risk and the utility  can \nprovide consumers with appropriate analytical tools, to \neffectively manage power purchases. Utilities can take a more \nopt-in approach where customers elect to select in a new rate \nplan such as dynamic pricing. Customer demography \nsegmentation related to consumption based profiling has to be ncarried out in these approaches. [27] describe work carried out \nusing SOM tool Viscovery for clustering and visualization of \nconsumer information from a utility in Finland. In addition to \nseveral consumption based attributes, the type of residence \nwas used for the segmentation.   \nD. Capturing Irregularities \nMany load profile studies have used data-mining techniques, \npattern recognition, and statistical techniques to obtain nknowledge from customer load records. Knowledge of \nconsumption behaviour is very important as it is very useful \nfor for formulating tariffs and develop marketing strategies, as \nwell as allowing customised billing Knowledge gathered from \ncustomers’ load profiles could also be used to identify, detect, \nand predict behaviour irregularities or abnormalities that \nultimately may be due to faulty metering or to human nintervention and fraud [28]. Potential theft or technical losses \ncan also be identified by comparing smart meter data with \nmeasurements from sensors attached to transformers or \nfeeders [5]. \nE. Metering Intelligence to Support Real-Time Operations \nThe rolling out of AMI makes it possible to acquire real time \ninformation of energy use, connect renewable energy to grids, \nmanage power outages and faster restoration, fault detection nand early warning. How to fast process an extremely large \nvolume of signals and sensor, retrieving required information, \nidentifying operation patterns and control of power systems is \nan open question. For example one problem is the \nmeasurement of voltage distortion \(harmonic voltages and \nvoltage unbalance  generated metering data can also \nbe used to derive a dynamic model for improving volt-var \ncontrol [32], as well as controlling congestion and stability in \na power market [33]. Metering data can be also used to derive nthe knowledge of the power flows at and near the low voltage \nend of the distribution networks so that the loading and losses \nof the network can be known more accurately. This can help \nto prevent overloading components \(transformers and lines  paper has described smart meter data as big data and \npresented a smart metering landscape which can be used to \nposition diverse meter data analytics applications. AMI data \ncan be categorised as consumption and events data and at \npresent most of the analytics is carried out on consumption \ndata. Although the analytics techniques used are not novel, the \nvolume and velocity and the variance of the AMI collected \ndata have enabled applications such as load profiling \n,forecasting, pricing intelligence and capturing irregularities 


to \nbe carried out at much detailed levels of granularity thus \nopening up previously unthinkable opportunities.  A summary \nof big data aspects for data categories are shown in table 1. \nTable 1: Big data aspects of consumption and events data \nBig Data \nAspects \nConsumption Events \nRaw Data Volume high low medium \nVelocity high high \nVariance low/ medium high \nApplication\nneeds \nProcessing\nspeed \nnon-essential essential \nVisualization required required \nThe key analytics requirements for utilities in the future would nbe real time analytics, stream analytics, bringing diverse data \ntypes together, analyzing data on the fly and in native formats \nas well as parallel processing, grid and cloud computing to \nmanage massive volumes and distributed processing. \nREFERENCES\n[1] R.

stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
