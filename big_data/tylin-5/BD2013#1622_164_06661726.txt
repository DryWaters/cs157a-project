Science and Information Conference 2013 \nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n124 | P a g e nwww.conference.thesai.org \nConstructing hybrid architectures and dynamic \nservices in Cloud BPM\nJosé Martinez Garro \nUniversidad Nacional de La Plata \nUNLP \nLa Plata, Argentina \nPatricia Bazán \nLINTI – Universidad Nacional de La Plata \nUNLP \nLa Plata, Argentina \n \n \nAbstract—along the last decade, organizations have developed \nBPM \(Business Process Management consequent \nevolution in the involved systems. Different technical issues such \nas high availability and growing connectivity, and also \neconomical aspects generated by development and maintenance \ncosts have guided a big number of organizations to choose a \nCloud computing model. In this paradigm many economical and ntechnical risks are diminished. Due to BPM being a naturally \nintegrative model, there are concepts like workflow dynamism, \nor dynamic and mobile services that are reconsidered by entering \ninto a cloud environment. In the present article we introduce a \nset of concepts presented in the current bibliography that are \nbeing rediscovered while BPM is inserted in the cloud, and we \nalso implement proposals for most of them in a particular BPMS \n\(Business Process Management System Computing; Mobile; SOA \nI. INTRODUCTION  \nIn this article we face the problem of including a Business \nProcess Management System \(BPMS nexternal environment to the organization. It is one of the \npurposes of this work to make a current bibliography analysis \nin sections II to IX, where we describe the different variants of \na cloud model, its benefits and cons, hybrid architectures with \nembedded systems and the impact of using mobile devices. \nThen from section X onwards we will make concrete \ncontributions with some developments made using an internal nBPMS. Using this tool we have designed solutions for several \nproblems, like dynamic services and hybrid architectures, as \nwell as the access to cloud based process engines from mobile \ndevices. Finalizing the document we present some conclusions \nabout the current state of the art and future work proposals in \nthis research line. \nII. RELATED WORKS \nThere are different trends in what comes to BPM in the \ncloud, but they are different if we are talking about research \nfields or trends in the market. Currently we can find research nworks tending to analyze the different paradigms of BPM \n\(whether in the cloud or embedded escalate \naccording to user?s needs, connectivity that grows and mobile \ndevice incorporation. In [1], [2] and 3] especially we found \ntrends like adaptive workflows, dynamic services and complex \nevents. These references support the idea of the hybrid \narchitecture and the dynamic services assigned by geolocation \nthat we are proposing in further sections. Regarding the other \nreferences, we will cite each one of them in every related topic.  \nIn relation to the commercial market, we find fewer \nadvances than in the research area. Most of the available \nBPMS in the cloud are very similar to the embedded ones, and \nthe concepts introduced in the present work and in [2] like \ndecomposed processes or dynamic services are not present. \nThe facts that we accomplished on our internal product are \npresented from subsection IX onwards. These features are not npresent in actual commercial products, showing again that \nCloud BPM is a field in constant evolution, with a lot of work \nto be done. \nIII. BPM AND CLOUD \nWith the fast technological development in the context of napplication launching and execution using cloud based \narchitectures, companies that began to choose this model are \nfacing new problems. In particular, collaborative business \nprocesses with several interaction areas offer an optimization \npotential through the combination of cloud computing and \nBPM. A common factor between both paradigms is the flexible \nand agile approach. The cloud based computing model may be \nconsidered as an enabler for an improved combination of \nservice oriented architectures, and also an agile procedure for nBusiness Process Management. But this potential depends on \nthe conditions imposed by the different frameworks, which can \nbe viewed from technical and financial aspects. \nA. Technical view:  \nFrom a technical point of view there are three dimensions \nin order to design, implement and successfully operate the ndifferent BPM tools in a cloud environment. These dimensions \nare: programming, integration and security. \n Programming: complex and distributed systems are \neasily reachable in current IT. In connection with nobtaining more usability and flexibility, this \ncomplexity represents new requirements for Software nEngineering. To solve this problem it is necessary to \nadopt new languages. So, based on new concepts and ninnovative techniques, the efforts invested in the \ndevelopment phase have been reduced to convert the ncomplexity of these new aspects into a manageable \nelement. \n? Integration: this category can be divided in data \nintegration, function integration and process \nintegration. Under the light of the new challenges nScience and Information Conference 2013 \nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n125 | P a g e nwww.conference.thesai.org \ninvolved, the current topic plays an important role in \ndifferent scenarios. For example, a cloud based \nworkflow can control distributed activities beyond the \ncompanies? border, mainly due to its easy accessibility. \nFor a simplified execution of several process instances \nit is necessary to have 


integration interfaces and \nstructured methods that allow joining the new \ncomponents under the considered process. \n? Security: this concept can be divided into three \ncategories: functional security, information security \nand data security. All these categories have a \nsignificant relevance for BPM, especially in regard to \nbusiness process grids and distributed process servers. \nFunctional security specifies how the current status \ncorresponds with the desired functionality status. The \ninformation security is focused in unauthorized \nchanges or information extractions, as well as data \nsecurity is in charge of the process related data. \nEven more, from a technical point of view the question on \n“what processes are more appropriated to be executed in a \ncloud-based architecture” should be responded. The possible \nrisks, such as insufficient integration options, location and \nintegrity problems as well as programming interfaces should be ntaken in consideration. \nB. Financial view \nThere are two dimensions from the financial point of view: \n Availability: the services provided by a cloud \ninfrastructure can be accessed at any time because of \nthe high availability model. Based in a high abstraction \nlevel, the customization and installation are nsignificantly easier. In addition with this simplification, \nthe final user is capable of working with the service \nimmediately. \n? Investment risk: in the context of the different variable \nbilling models \(for example “pay per transaction contain relevant costs given by \ntransferences and transactions [1] [2] [3] [4]. \nIV. BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS nCloud based BPM provides users the possibility of using \nsoftware in a “pay per use” way, instead of forcing them to \nmake big investments in BPM software, hardware and \nmaintenance, versus the traditional licensing applications. \nSystems can escalate up and down according to the user„s \nneeds. This means they do not have to worry about the over/ \nunder resource provisioning because of the high adaptability \nprovided currently by cloud service providers, as we can see in \nFigure 1. \nThe current model, on the other hand, has several low npoints. By putting a BPMS in the cloud, users may lose control \nover sensitive data. This aspect results major considering that \nbusiness processes inside an organization may manage \nimportant information for it and its members. On the other \nhand, the non high computational activities? efficiency and \neffectiveness cannot be increased by putting them in the cloud, \nbut rather these activities may get more expensive. For \nexample an activity which is not intensively computational \ncould need to process a certain amount of data. The ntransference of these data to the cloud could take more time \nthan the transmission to an embedded version installed locally. \nThat transference could result bigger than the real necessity of \nprocessing. Even more the cost of the activity may increase \ndue the data transference. This element is one of the billing \nconcepts in a cloud computing system because of the high \nconnection availability [1] [2] [5] [6]. \n \nFig. 1. Service model \nV. SERVICE MODEL \nA. Infrastructure as a service \(IaaS the cloud \nuser is responsible for the operating system, the middleware \nand the applications running on the virtual machine. The action \nof installing BPM software in an IaaS cloud solution is \ncomparable to installing an embedded BPMS, since everything \nexcept the hardware is managed by the cloud user. \nFurthermore, the user has to make some security decisions in \norder to avoid intrusions. According to this, possible security nmeasures are: port blocking, access control policies and \nupdating the applications and the operating system frequently. \nB. Product as a Service \(PaaS Product as a Service”, the responsibilities for the user and \nthe cloud provider are different. The execution engine is \nassumed as a part of the platform, so it is offered by the service \nprovider. Users must upload their processes to run them in the \ncloud. The engine can be used by several users since the \nplatform is shared. The responsibility for data storage and \nmanagement is no longer in charge of the user, who has to deal \nwith several security issues: \n? The process models should not be readable by intruders \nin posession of a description file. \n? Process models should not be altered by intruders. \n? Process models should not be deployed in other \nservers. \nIn order to achieve these requirements, the process model \ndescriptions should be encrypted and signed. The encryption \nensures that process models are not readable by intruders. By \nthe action of signing them, it can be assured that a file is only \nvalid for a particular execution engine, and using it to point to \nScience and Information Conference 2013 \nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n126 | P a g e nwww.conference.thesai.org \nanother execution engine will provoke an error. This turns into \nutility considering that the same server can be accessed by \ndifferent users in a shared environment. \nStoring the application database can be an issue also. Data \nshould be encrypted in order to not be readable by intruders nData encryption in a relational database generates expressivity \nissues with queries using relational operators. For example, \njoins can have problems in an encrypted data context. \nC. Software as a Service SaaS itself. The \napplication is no longer an asset of the enterprise cloud user but \nit is offered by the cloud 


provider. The application may be \ngiven to multiple cloud users in a single or multiple tenant \narchitecture In a single tenant paradigm, an execution engine \nis installed for each process model. In a multi-tenant nenvironment, multiple users and process models are served by \na unique engine. The data stored by the cloud provider should \nbe assured in order to prevent unintended accesses, both by the \nservice provider or other users in the cloud. The same measures \nwe have mentioned in the previous subsection related with \nsigning and encryption can be applied to solving this problem. \nIn a multi-tenant architecture, different users access the nsame execution engine. The data used by one user should not \nbe accessible to other cloud users. There are two possible \nsolutions for this problem: in the first place, a database for each \ncloud user can be created As an alternative, a column to each \ntable where the user identifier is saved can be added. It is \nnecessary to observe the scalability of both solutions: the \namount of users could increase, and because of that, the need \nof resources too [1] [6] [7] [8]. \nVI. COMBINATION OF EMBEDDED AND CLOUD SCHEMAS \nPrivacy protection is one of the barriers to execute BPM in \na cloud environment. Not all users desire to put their sensitive \ndata outside the organization. Besides, it is necessary to \nobserve products portability and versions, and their availability \nin a cloud system. Another not minor problem is the efficiency.  \nThe intensive computing activities may obtain benefits in \nthe cloud due to the scalability and the computing force high navailability. The non intensive computational tasks, on the \nother hand, not always take advantage of this context. The \nperformance of one activity running in an embedded \nenvironment should be better than in the cloud because of the \ndata that are transferred in order to execute the activity. These \nactivities could also result expensive due to the fact that data \ntransference is a billing criterion in the cloud.  \n Architecture: in most BPM solutions, the process \nengine, the activities and the process data are located in nthe same side, even in an embedded or cloud solution. \nThere are some papers introducing the PAD model n\(Process - Activity - Data approach, the \nprocess model, the involved activities and the data are \nseparately distributed. The PAD model defines four \npossibilities of distribution: \n \n \nFig. 2. PAD Distribution Schema [6] \n1 the traditional alternative where all \nelements are distributed over the final user side. \n2 pattern is useful when the user already has \na BPMS, but the high computing activities are located in the ncloud to increment their performance. \n3 BPMS, so they can use the cloud system in a “pay per \nuse” way. In this approach the activities with low computing \nintensity or the ones with sensitive data management can be \nlocated on the final user side. \n4 The fourth pattern is the cloud based model where all \nthe elements are located in the cloud. \n? Business processes consist of two kinds of flows: \ncontrol and data. Control flows regulate the execution \nof activities and their sequence, while data flows \ndetermine how the information is transferred from one nactivity to the other inside the process. BPM engines \nmust deal with the control of both kinds of flows. A ndata flow could contain sensitive data, so when a \nBPMS is deployed in the cloud, the content of those \nflows should be protected. \n? An example of the proposed architecture could be a \nscenario where the engine in the cloud only deals with \ndata flows using reference identifiers instead of real \ndata. When an activity needs sensitive data, the data \nbeing transferred to the activity are managed under \nuser supervision in an encryption tunnel. Sensitive data \nare saved in the final user side, and non sensitive data \nare saved in the cloud. This schema allows that \nsensitive data do not travel indiscriminately through \nthe web. \n? Optimal distribution: the cloud system costs have been \na study object in different articles. There are several nformulas to calculate the optimal distribution of \nactivities, since they can be located in the cloud or in nan embedded system. The calculation takes in \nconsideration time costs, monetary costs and privacy \nrisk costs. By using these formulas, users can make \ncost estimations about deploying part of their \napplications in an embedded or cloud system \nalternatively [2] [5] [6] [9].  \nScience and Information Conference 2013 nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n127 | P a g e  \nwww.conference.thesai.org \nVII. PROCESS DECOMPOSITION \nIt is possible to generalize the distribution and identify a \nfifth pattern where the process engine, the activities and data \nare deployed in the cloud and in the final user. This solution \npresents two potential benefits: \n1 The process engine regulates control and data flows. \nOne activity receives data from the process engine and after \nits execution the produced data are passed again to the \nprocess engine. Consider now a sequence of activities located \nin the cloud, while the process engine is deployed in the final \nuser. Each activity uses data produced by the previous activity \nas an income. Data are not passed directly from one activity \nto the other but they are sent to the process engine first. Since \ndata transference is one of the billing factors in this model this \nkind of situations could become more expensive when large \namounts of data are transmitted between activities. To avoid \nthis problem a process engine can be added to the cloud, in \norder to regulate 


the control and data flows between activities \nlocated inside it. When a sequence of activities is located in nthe cloud, data are regulated by the process engine in the \ncloud. This reduces the amount of data to be transmitted \nbetween the cloud and the embedded system. \n2 execute \nbusiness processes in a complete way in the embedded system \nuntil the former is available again. \nIn order to run a single business process between two \nseparated engines, it should be split into two individual nprocesses. It could be convenient for the users to take a \ndistribution list of the process and its activities. The process \ncan be automatically transformed into two business processes, \none in the cloud and the other in the embedded system. The \ncommunication between both systems can be described using a nchoreography language, like BPEL. Besides, the distribution \nlist can be created automatically according to the optimal \ndistribution formulas mentioned in subsection IV. \nBusiness process monitoring is more complicated now, \nsince the process has been divided into two or more parts. As a \nsolution, a monitoring tool can be developed for the original \nprocess, through the combination of the individual process \nmonitoring details. \nA possible approach to manage the process decomposition \nis to identify its structure and semantics When the control and \ndata dependencies are identified, the consequences of moving \nsome activities from the embedded system to the cloud and \nvice versa can be researched. When the activity distribution \nconsequences are known, a transformation model can be \ncreated.  \nThen, a business process and a list with marks are used to \ncreate two separated processes, one for the cloud and another \nfor the final user. Also, a choreography description can be \ngenerated in order to describe the communication between both \nprocesses using some standard language, like BPEL [6] [10]. \nVIII. PARTICULARITIES OF BPMS IN THE CLOUD \nA. Multiple web services in the same cloud instance \nTo reduce the overhead caused by initiating instances and \nto avoid extra costs some additional web services can be \ndeveloped in the same cloud instance, if they are adaptable to \nthe hardware. This optimization is mostly for workflows with \ndifferent cloud tasks, which can be executed in line inside the \nsame instance. Using this optimization, the existing static \nimages of virtual machine will not be able to be initiated \ndynamically: it is necessary to install additional software \nduring the instance?s execution time. The installation can be \nmade statically using for example a script executed via SSH. \nThrough it, a remote program is initiated to publish the web \nservice in the cloud instance by using parameterization nB. Dynamic task assignment to cloud resources \nThe idea of making outsourcing only of individual parts of nan application to the cloud can be extended with a dynamic \ntask assignment. The selection process is similar to the \ntransversal three phase model of cloud computing. In phase \none \(or discovering phase service broker creates a \ntable in a database which provides information about the secure \nproperties offered by the cloud suppliers. Possible properties in \nthis context are, for example, special hardware, best nperformance, lower price, price/performance rate and location \nin the cloud \(for reliability reasons or data closeness, as well as \nsensitiveness nIn the coincidence obtaining phase, the cloud service broker \ncompares the properties required by the task with the table of \nsecure properties. The cloud service providers that ensure all \nthe required properties are task potential owners. \nIn the authentication phase, the service broker selects the \ncheapest potential owner and assigns it as the current \nproprietary for each cloud task [6] [7] [11] [12] [23]. \nIX. THE CHALLENGE OF DYNAMIC SERVICES IN BPM \nThe advances in mobile systems and embedded computing \nhave guided to a computational environment that considers \npersonalization, mobility and real time computing as key \nelements. As a result SOA \(Service Oriented Architecture nmanagement and execution process. For business processes, \nthese adaptations represent challenges in terms of process \nmodeling, development and execution. In order to execute \nBPM in these new environments we should see what the \nrequired changes are. This makes possible to support services, \nwhich commonly are growing, dynamic and decentralized. \nThe research on emerging architectures based on web \nservices puts BPM as a key component in the development of \nthe next generation in web applications. The use of business \nprocess engines and models allows application designers and \nbusiness analysts to make focus in the system functionality \nwithout the necessity of considering wider technical \narchitectures.  \n  \nScience and Information Conference 2013 nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n128 | P a g e  \nwww.conference.thesai.org \nThe use of web services for creating loosely coupled \nbusiness processes leans on the orchestration in order to \naccomplish the functionality of the desired distributed \napplication. Typically this is made by the combination of stable nservices in an embedded workflow, or even in a cloud based \ninstallation. Nevertheless, in dynamic environments, services \nare not frequently static. They usually change their status and \ncharacteristics; or even the environment could be unstable and \nthe workflow should adapt dynamically to changes during nexecution.  \nThe environments with emerging web services are adopting \nmobile devices increasingly, as well 


as personal data and \nembedded low level functions. This type of services stretches \nBPM current limits. The emerging needs of these \ncomputational environments generate complex demands in \nbusiness processes. In a typical process oriented application, \nthe change can be managed through adding loops to the \nprocess, or making changes using templates as a reference. In \nmore dynamic environments the services have to be nrenegotiated and the workflows are altered during execution. \nChanging the process model during execution for example, \nby inserting a loop or a fork without major implications in current BPMS market still continues as an \nunexplored topic. \nOn the other hand, the viability studies to include the \ncurrent topic in a cloud based BPMS are still remaining. There \nare some positive factors, such as the error adaptation capacity, \nor even changes in the service location. Alternatively, one \nnegative factor could be to overload the server with \nfunctionality that decrements performance in tasks with high \ndata transference Because of this, time and financial costs \nresult higher. These factors are not really important in an nembedded BPMS [2] [3] [13]. \nX. EMERGING CHANGES IN BPM \nBPM and SOA can be considered as a perfect combination \nin terms of integration. BPM?s goal is to allow process \ndesigners to create applications without worrying about the \nsubjacent technical architecture. This fact has been possible \ndue to the service oriented representation of computational \nresources. \nWeb services in SOA present common interfaces and also \nsupport communication standards for data exchange. \nInside the integrated domain of the company and other \nsystems with web interface, the application of BPM using \nprocess engines to execute templates \(in languages like BPEL services \nRecently, the massive adoption of mobile devices has \nguided to the development of a new generation in web \napplications. For most organizations, these applications \nrepresent a new possibility for process improvement \(Figure 3 process designer can be \nobserved when the workflow is present in a mobile device, or \nwhen some critical decisions have been made based on mobile \nservices in an emerging environment. \nIn this context, workflows are present to handle the \nresponse to emergencies from a centralized perspective. \nNevertheless, the change present in the central workflow is \nworsened by local factors. For example, the workflow could \nneed to react to contextual information connected with \nambulance and doctor?s location in an emergency site. Here the ndevice location is constantly changing and the context where \nthey are could vary at anytime. \nThis non-predictable scenario cannot be modeled in a static \nworkflow. BPM should adapt to the status of some services, \nand this status could be related to the context where the \nservices actually are.  \nThe inclusion of mobile devices gives more dynamism to \nthe BPM model, even in an embedded environment. At the \ntime of considering this inclusion in the cloud, there are some \nmajor aspects to take into account, such as sensitive data \ntransferring. This should be done by using encryption and \nsigning methods. The availability to access the cloud system \nfrom public networks is another important aspect, considering \nthat it could be external to the enterprise network. We will \ndelve into these aspects when we discuss the proposed \nimplementing options 2] [13] [14]. \nB. Real time services \nDifferent organizations \(i.e. large scale manufacturers BPM to control internal elements, such as the \nsupplier chain management. The workflows around the office nsystems require minimum maintenance, and allow a quick \nintegration with similar systems. \nIn the manufacturing domain, the inactivity time is a big \nconcern and an increasing cost factor. Typical causes of this \nproblem are machine failures or component supplying failures.  \nScience and Information Conference 2013 nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n129 | P a g e  \nwww.conference.thesai.org \nThe control and integration with production lines using \nBPM mechanisms have some advantages in terms of \nreconfiguration and standardization But there are some real \nproblems with BPM in terms of security and reliability in the \nproduction line execution. These problems do not decrease in a \ncloud environment, though the control and monitoring from noutside the organization are benefits of these approach. This \ngenerates more availability and accessibility in the monitoring \nsystem by considering a cloud context instead of an embedded \none, which provides more flexibility for contingency treatment. \nC. User Centered Services \nService providers lean over BPM to handle the different \nclient choice ways through online systems. With standard \nworkflows, user experience can be more controlled. This \napproach should join activities with web services. The identity \nmanagement architectures use policy frameworks and trust \nrings in order to establish authentication and authorization rules \nbetween the service providers. These rules and mechanisms \ncould be implemented through centralized workflows. The \napproaches centered in the user require additional contact, \ndepending on the available security context. A possible \nsolution for this problem is modeling the specific security \ninteractions through annotations. These should be \nautomatically executed using a process model transformation, \ncommonly 


based on implementation and some BPMS special \ncomponents. \nD. User Centered Security \nReliability measurement and management are vital for \nservice execution and data management inside the framework. \nThe confidence awareness gives users the opportunity of \nexpressing their needs in the network, and finding appropriated nservices. Typically the BPM operations are executed from \ncentralized servers with predefined access rules In a centered \nsecurity environment this execution becomes more complex. \nThe complexity grows due to the data associated with the \npolicies. A big number of authentications and individual \nauthorizations are needed in order to access to the distributed \ndata object groups. This authentication reduces business \nprocess performance and could cause failures in applications. \nIn a cloud context these aspects have plenty of validity: \nsensitive data traffic and authentication in service execution \nbecome essential in shared environments. The possibilities of \nmaking controls in a distributed way are increased, and \nbecause of this the overhead produced by centralized \nauthentication mechanisms is reduced [8] [9] [15] [16]. \nXI IMPLEMENTATIONS CARRIED OUT \nThe different implementations we are introducing were \ndeveloped using a BPMS implemented by our team. This \nproduct has been developed experimentally for an internal \nproject, evolving then to a point where it was possible to put it. \nIn a stable production context. From there it was possible to \nimplement different researchable aspects, where we found the \nitems presented in the current paper: hybrid architectures \nbetween cloud and embedded systems, besides the invocation \nof mobile and dynamic services Table I introduces a short \nreview of every aspect. \nTABLE I.  IMPLEMENTATION ASPECTS IN THE CLOUD \nAspect Implementation \nDynamism \nin service \nassignment \nIn an embedded system, services in general are assigned \nto activities in design time, which makes their stability \npredictable. In a cloud scenario we find a large diversity \nof locations accessing to different points of the BPM \nservice. Nowadays most of cloud servers allow \nimplementing a service mirror model. This last feature \ngrows by using mobile devices and, consequently more \naccess points. For this reason the existence of routing \ntables in the execution nodes should be necessary. These \ntables allow according to certain criteria \(such as client \nlocation, average response time connection speed performance. The process \nexecution is more dynamic, and more robustness in error \nmanagement is needed nProcess \nDecompositi\non \nThe decomposed processes are located along the cloud \nand embedded systems, but they should be able to be \nexecuted and monitored as a unique entity. For this \npurpose, start and end message type events are used, \nwhere the finalization of one process step initiates the \nnext one. In terms of monitoring a web application and \nseveral web services are implemented in order to \nrecompile the instance execution data along the \narchitecture. \nMobile \ndevices \nThe dynamism and adaptability of the BPMS are \nincremented, so the system utilization from dissimilar \nplatforms is increased also. Reliable security standards are \nstill observed as necessary, in order to enable the \nexchange of sensitive data between the clients and the \nserver This is more pronounced in a cloud environment, \nwhere the servers could be in a mirror model and nsynchronized in a distributed way. \n \nXII. HYBRID SCHEMAS IMPLEMENTATION \nThe possibility of locating a BPMS in an external space to \nthe organization \(for example in a cloud computing \narchitecture with a SaaS schema makes feasible to access it \nfrom inside the organization through an Internet connection, as \nwell as from any other external point. Considering this fact, \nbesides the possibility of having clients accessing from mobile ndevices, the access points to the cloud are incremented.  \nThis generates the following issues about process nexecution, and their corresponding proposed solutions: \n? Process Decomposition: as exposed in Section V, the nfact of putting a BPM server in the cloud generates the \nproblem of what to do with sensitive data management. \nFacing this problem, this solution can be enounced: in \ncase of publishing the corporative database \(or at least \npart of it organizational security policies, the \ndecomposition of the process is going to be necessary \nin order to implement a hybrid schema. In this \nscenario, the high computing activities can be located \ninside the cloud in order to take advantage of the \ncomputing performance, and the activities that make \nuse of corporative sensitive data are located inside the \norganization in an embedded installation. \n? Decomposed process synchronization: the \ndisaggregated process is formally divided into sections \naccording to the amount of participating servers.  \nScience and Information Conference 2013 \nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n130 | P a g e  \nwww.conference.thesai.org \nAccording to this, it is going to be necessary to solve \nhow to synchronize the servers in order to ensure the \nexecution sequence of the process. There are, in theory, \ndistinct ways to implement the synchronization, such \nas by messages or event monitoring. By using \nmessages, the end event of each process part invokes \nthe start of the next one. This can be made through start \nand end message type events, included both in the last \nversion of standard BPMN \(Business Process \nManagement Notation execution of the end \nevent of a process throws a message to the BPMS in \norder to notify the finalization and 


require the \nexecution of a process previously parameterized. This \nimplementation was selected for our internal BPMS, \nwhere the notifications were implemented using a \nmessage queue and a daemon for pooling. This daemon \nreceives messages and initiates instances of the \nrequired process. In this way, each intervenient server \nin this hybrid model \(the embedded and also the cloud \nbased ones service in \norder to receive the finalization notifications and later \nnotify the process engine. The result of this is to \ninitiate the instances corresponding to the requested \ndefinition. \n? Decomposed process monitoring: the biggest \nproblem of having a process partitioned orientation is \nto monitor the different distributed instances, and at the \nsame time to accomplish an integrated model of them \nunder the optic of the real process” which they belong \nto. In order to solve this inconvenient the following \nsolution was designed: in first place it is necessary to \nassociate the different instances with the original \nprocess, in order to recover them from the different \nexisting servers. Once they are recovered, some kind of \napplication in charge of gathering the recovered data \nand showing them seamlessly should be provided. The \nmost important thing in this aspect is to accomplish \nmonitoring transparency for the user, without forcing \nhim to distinguish the server where each activity has \nbeen developed. This provides thus an integrated nvisualization of the different instances by seeing them \nas a same entity. The implementation of the current nfeature was made by a cloud resident web application. \nIt was located there in order to access every nintervenient server, whether cloud or embedded, and to \nensure user access from any point. For this purpose it is \nimportant for the application to have a catalog with \nevery existing server in the architecture, with their \nlocation information updated. Each intervening server \nhas a copy of a web service which receives a process \ndefinition identifier and returns information about \nevery existing instance associated with the sent ndefinition. The returned information includes instance \nidentification, current status \(running, completed nsuspended resident \nweb application sends an invocation of the web service \nwith the selected process definition as a parameter to \neach intervening server, and receives the information \nof the associated instances. Then this information will \nbe visualized in a web interface where the user can \nselect a particular instance and observe its details. For \nthis purpose the application comprises a web service to \nrequire each server the details of the associated \nactivities. The information returned includes \nidentification of the activity associated participant, \nstart date, current status and end date. After receiving \nthis information the web application will allow the user \nto observe the activity?s details transparently, without \nindicating the server information where they were \nexecuted. This helps to accomplish location \ntransparency [6] [17] [18 nXIII. DYNAMIC SERVICES IMPLEMENTATION \nThe fact of executing a distributed partitioned process \nallows us to reflect about the services that implement each \nactivity and their location. In a hybrid model context, the norganizations decide to maintain their embedded systems for \nprivacy reasons related to the sensitive data inter alia. Besides, \nwe should consider the legacy applications used for \nimplementing process activities they could use corporative \ndatabases or non-scalable technologies, so it could be \nnecessary to conserve them in an embedded context instead of \nlocate them in the cloud. So we could execute activities in a \ncloud based BPMS, but really be invoking services located in \nanother context, in this case, an embedded system, or even nother independent cloud.  \nIn this context the following problem appears: we have to \nconsider the existence of multiple access points, potentiated \nbesides by the amount of mobile devices trying to connect. \nHere we present the following solution strategy: service \nmirrors that allow optimizing the execution from different npoints of the architecture according to a convenient location.  \nAccording to the magnitude of processes and services, it \ncould be necessary to consider cloud server mirrors, in order to \ndecrement the bottle neck possibilities. This way, facing the \nnecessity of executing a process activity and its consequent \nservice, a geolocation service can be deployed in the server in \norder to decide which version of the process/service is more \nconvenient for the user. It is possible to obtain the client's \ngeolocation through different mechanisms automatically \(such \nas the IP address in the case of a PC inserted in a network, the \nGPS or some QRCode scanning in the case of a mobile device system to execute the service requested by the client, as \nwe can see in Figure 4. \nFor this purpose, BPM servers must have geolocation cross \ntables where, by giving a location, the hybrid system node to \nderive the client can be known. \nThe implementation can be as simple or as complex as a \nbig the system is. If the nodes composing the system \(between \nprincipal nodes and their mirrors include a routing table inside the BPM servers. \nThis way, once obtained the device?s location, the request can \nbe derived automatically to the most convenient server.  \nAlso, the same procedure could be applied in relation to the \nprocess or the service, according to the implementation criteria. \nScience and Information 


Conference 2013 \nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n131 | P a g e  \nwww.conference.thesai.org \n \nFig. 4. Dynamic service selection using geolocation \nIn the case of our internal BPMS, we have developed only \ndynamic services due to the low amount of servers needed: \nonly two embedded systems and a third one in a cloud nenvironment. So, through a geolocation table that updates \ndynamically the node?s IP address, we can decide which the \nmost convenient service to invoke is, according to the device?s \nlocation.  \nA possible scalable solution for a major system may be to \nimplement a more complex geolocation system, such as the \nprovided by open source systems like hostip.info [24]. This \nsystem has an easy-to-incorporate server side Rest API used nfor obtaining the client device?s location. It can be used by \nincorporating extra parameters to the service invocation URL, \nand based on a more complex routing table, it is possible to \ndecide by rules which the most convenient host for the \nredirection is. This dynamic feature, even when it improves the \nperformance indicators by executing the most convenient \nservices for the user considering availability and location nobligates the engine to be robust, since service execution is not \npredictable and errors must be handled on the fly [1] [19] [20]. \nXIV. ACCESSING THE CLOUD WITH MOBILE DEVICES \nRecently in BPM, the execution of process activities \nthrough mobile devices has gained ground. In the field of \nembedded BPMS, the use of these devices is increasingly \ncommon, and the exchange of sensitive data between them and \nthe server is often considered. This problem has been solved \nthrough encryption algorithms and digital sign features with \npublic and private keys, allowing sending sensitive data to the \nserver using a wireless connection and then guaranteeing the \nsent data integrity and authenticity, as well as the sender \ninformation. \nBy considering a cloud environment instead of an \nembedded one, and changing essentially the technical scenario, \nthe aspects considered previously for embedded systems \nrequire a revision to verify their validity. As a solution for the ncurrent problem, we enounce that cloud based BPMS will need \nsensitive data encryption and signing for the intervening \ndevices, as well as the encryption of sensitive data conserved in \nthe process server. \nIn this context we have developed a mobile device oriented \napplication, based on Java and suitable for Android, which nallows connecting with the process engine to visualize and \ncomplete the activity associated forms. It can also encrypt and \nsign data and then send them to the server. \nThe application mechanism is as follows: when it starts \nfrom the device, a connection with the server is opened using a \nlogin access. Once the client is authenticated the Rest API \ndeployed on the server is used: particularly an operation which \nreturns the completion-pending activities assigned to the user. \nOnce this information has returned, the user can select any of \nthe activities for completion. By selecting one of them, the \nassociated form is displayed. Once the form?s data are \nobtained, these are encrypted and signed using standards \nprovided by Java. Between the most tested encryption \nalgorithms we found DES and TripleDES, implemented by \nnative libraries, and for digital signing we used JKS and \nPKCS12 as a mechanism to construct an internal certification \nauthority. This way we could sign encrypted data by using \nasymmetric key certificates.  \nThe use of mobile devices in a BPM context requires some \nsecurity considerations before using the application. This \nshould be done in order to guarantee integrity and authenticity \nin the sensitive data sent, as well as the authenticity and non-\nrepudiation of the sender. For that purpose, users, as well as in \nother existing applications in the market, must previously \nregister the device in the BPMS avoiding in this way any \nunauthorized access. Once the device is registered in the \nprocess server, the user can execute the application directly and \nconnect with the server without generating an unauthorized \naccess. \nOnce the access through mobile devices to the cloud is \npossible, the access points are incremented, in addition to the \ntraditional existing nodes. In order to satisfy these accesses \nefficiently the duplication of adjustable services is necessary \nconsidering the user?s location, as well as hybrid architectures \nguarantying portability and accessibility. It is also mandatory \nto analyze the security and integrity of the exchanged sensitive \ndata [2] [8] [21] [22]. \nXV CONCLUSIONS \nAs we have seen previously, BPM has incremented its \naction field along the last years. The market for traditional \nenterprise systems has suffered modifications in its licensing \nand commercialization paradigm, and BPM was not an \nexception for this, like other products of the same segment \nsuch as ERP or CRM This adaptation pushes BPM to adapt \nexisting technologies and methodologies according to new \nneeds. Even when the cloud architecture solves the necessities \nof accessibility and high availability, there are some problems \nthat should still be reviewed and researched deeply, such as \nsensitive data management in mobile devices, as well as in \ncloud server storing. For both cases we have provided \nScience and Information Conference 2013 \nOctober 7-9, 2013 | London, UK \n132 | P a g e  \nwww.conference.thesai.org \nimplementations inside an internal BPMS, though we believe \nthere is still a lack of real standardization inside the market nregarding these aspects. These topics could generate more \nportability between products and installation schemas. \nThe system accessibility and the variety of devices are \nincremented, challenging the performance of 


the cloud system. \nThis shows the necessity of mirror schemas and hybrid \narchitectures, which allow to integrate existing applications \nwithout jeopardizing their integrity with other process areas \nthat may require high computing benefits offered by the cloud \narchitecture. \nEven though the distribution between embedded and cloud \nsystems was considered as a powerful alternative, it is very \nimportant to remember the relevance of the calculation \nformulas in order to estimate accurately the distribution costs, \nsince the data transference is an issue to deal with. This subject \nis not a minor one, and the research on it is not really profound \nyet. Our focus is put on obtaining in the future an easy way to \ncalculate if a task is a good or bad candidate to be located in \nthe cloud, and also to obtain a certain methodology to optimize \nthe data transference between the different distributed nodes in \nthe architecture.  \nNowadays our efforts are focused also in deepening the \ndynamic services model, optimizing the geolocation scenario. \nThis paradigm takes relevance in a complex environment, \nwhere the distribution of the clients is a very decisive factor for nservice execution. When the distance between clients and \nservers is long, a good service selection and assignment is the \ndifference between a good and a bad process performance. \nOn the other hand, considering the process lifecycle, the \nmonitoring and improving phases are relatively new concepts \nin cloud BPM. Over this subject, our interest is to obtain a \ngeneric application that allows process mining applied to ndistributed processes.  \nThe procedure will be based on decomposed processes over \ndifferent instances of cloud architectures, and the challenge \nleans on obtaining a better version of the process using \ndifferent algorithms and applying automatically they obtained \nimprovements along the whole architecture. \nREFERENCES n[1] T.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
