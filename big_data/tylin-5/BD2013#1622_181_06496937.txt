Sensitive next genera-\ntion arrays, such as the Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interfer-\nometer, thus offer a potentially important capability for space\nsituational awareness, allowing satellites in geo-synchronous\nEarth orbit \(GEO to be inspected after launch. A critical\nfactor for such observations is a lack of short spacings between\nthe telescopes comprising the interferometric array. Large\nGEO satellites are frequently 20–30 m in size, hence ideally the\nshortest spacings used for the observations should be between\n1.2–1.8 m for observations at 1µm wavelength. These cannot\neasily be realised with existing separated-element arrays. In\nthis paper we explore the approach of combining observations\nfrom a separated-element interferometer with interferometric\ndata obtained by optical masking of a “single-dish” telescope.\nWe present simulations that demonstrate that substantial im-\nprovements in image fidelity can be achieved in this way. Two\nshapes of generic satellite shape are investigated, intended to\nbe representative of the majority of bright GEO targets, and\nthe efficacy of the method is assessed for these different target\nshapes and differing brightness levels.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1 INTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\n2 IMAGING SATELLITES WITH LONG-BASELINE\nARRAYS 2\n3 IMAGING MODEL . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\n4 SIMULATIONS 4\n5 RESULTS 5\n6 DISCUSSION 6\n7 SUMMARY 8\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\nREFERENCES 8\nBIOGRAPHIES 8\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe increasingly large volume of commercial and military\nhardware in geo-synchronous Earth orbit \(GEO optical/infrared \(IR resolution imaging be of use for diagnostic\nevaluation, e.g. for confirming the successful deployment\nof solar panels or high-gain antennae, but such a capability\nmight also allow for the monitoring of the local environments\nof such satellites and the detection of potentially harmful\nlocal space debris.\n978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 c©2013 IEEE.\n1 IEEEAC Paper #2257, Version 3.0, Updated 04/01/2013.\nHowever, the current capabilities of the largest ground-based\ntelescopes fall well below what is necessary for a useful\ngeo-synchronous imaging capability. For example, a 10 m\ntelescope operating with a perfect adaptive optics \(AO centred at 1.65µm able to resolve the longest dimension of large solar\npanels. The next-generation of 30–40 m-class ground-based\nastronomical telescopes would conceivably be able to deliver\na more valuable capability, i.e with resolutions at the few\nmetre level, but the projected timelines for these projects\nsuggest that such diffraction-limited imaging will not occur\nuntil the post-2020 timeframe.\nAn alternative strategy is to utilise aperture synthesis meth-\nods. Long baseline optical/IR interferometric arrays, such as\nthe CHARA, VLTI and NPOI telescopes, can now routinely\ndeliver images of astronomical targets with 5 nanoradian\nangular resolution. In geo-synchronous orbit this corresponds\nto a spatial scale of only 18 cm. A key shortcoming of\nsuch arrays, though, has been their relatively poor sensitivity\nas compared to single dish telescopes However, second-\ngeneration arrays such as the Magdalena Ridge Observatory\nInterferometer \(MROI  expected to realise a limiting\nsensitivity some 10 ? 100× better than existing arrays, al-\nlowing unprecedented access to a considerable fraction of the\npopulation of geo-synchronous targets.\nIn a recent paper [2] we presented a preliminary analysis of\nthe capabilities of the MROI for geo-synchronous satellite\nimaging. While our sensitivity calculations suggested that as\nmany as 50% of GEO targets would be detectable, the large\nlinear sizes of most of these targets presented a challenge for\ninterferometric imaging Existing long-baseline arrays have\nsuch a high angular resolution that they “resolve out” the\nlarge scale structure in the targets, rendering reliable imaging\ndifficult. While the use of a-priori information, such as image\npositivity, can help to mitigate some of the resulting imaging\nartefacts, a better approach may be to explicitly capture low\nangular resolution information on the target and then use this\nadditional data in the interferometric image reconstruction\nprocess.\nIn this paper we explore such an approach, where data from 


a\nlong baseline interferometer are combined with data secured\ncontemporaneously with a separate large aperture i.e. 10-m\nclass telescope is used in an “non-\nredundant aperture-masked” mode, emulating the use of an\ninterferometric array though with baselines only extending to\na maximum of set by the aperture diameter. This is a some-\nwhat different approach to that of Mozurkewich et al. [3] who\nhave investigated the use of a common-mount interferometer,\ni.e. a multi-element interferometric array mounted on a large\n1\n50 m diameter steerable platform, but with baselines ranging\nfrom a few metres to the maximum size of the platform.\nWe discuss the feasibility of such a hybrid “single\ntelescope+long baseline array” scheme and present imaging\nsimulations using a Maximum Entropy based algorithm that\ncombines the sparse Fourier data measured by the long-\nbaseline and single-dish interferometer arrays to recover high\nangular resolution images. Interestingly, we find that even a\nrelatively small amount of shorter baseline data can improve\nthe quality and reliability of the interferometric image recon-\nstructions substantively.\nIn section 2 we present a brief review of the difficulties\nof GEO imaging, while in sections 3 and 4 we outline the\nimplementation of the imaging and image recovery models\nwe have used. Our results are presented in section 5 and\nare discussed in section 6. Finally we summarise our key\nfindings in section 7.\n2. IMAGING SATELLITES WITH\nLONG-BASELINE ARRAYS\nThe empirical rules of thumb established through years of\nradio interferometric imaging can be straightforwardly trans-\nlated to the problem of interferometric imaging of geo-\nsynchronous satellites. As for all interferometric arrays,\nthe interference signals secured on those telescopes with the\nlongest telescope-to-telescope separations \(a.k.a “baselines or equiva-\nlently the highest spatial frequencies the shortest interferometer\nbaselines that probe the largest angular scales in the target.\nIn the 1.65µm H band window, a 1 m structure at geo-\nsynchronous altitude would require interferometer baselines\nat least as long as 59 m to resolve it fully. On the other hand,\nif the same target happened to have solar panels spanning\n27 m — a median value for the GEO assets seen nowadays\n— data secured on baselines as short as 2 m would typi-\ncally be required to reproduce these in any recovered image.\nInterferometric imaging studies typically aim to sample the\n2-dimensional Fourier \(or uv Bmax, to some minimum, Bmin, in\nas uniform a way as is reasonably possible. Under these\ncircumstances, then one is usually able to recover an image\nwith at least N ×N independent resolution elements, where\nN Bmax/Bmin, as long as roughly this number of inde-\npendent measurements of the uv plane are secured. For the\nrange of spatial scales outlined above, this would correspond\nto approximately 500 separate Fourier plane measurements.\nThe ability of existing synthesis arrays to secure such large\ndatasets is an issue. An N element array measures N\(N ?\n1 so, for example, 6-element arrays such\nas CHARA or NPOI can measure only 15 baselines per\nspectral channel Furthermore, for geo-synchronous targets\none cannot use “Earth rotation synthesis”, the strategy used\nwith astronomical targets to exploit the rotation of the Earth\nto increase the instantaneous uv plane coverage. The working\nmodel for interferometric GEO imaging has thus been \(see,\ne.g. [4 so that a single array\nconfiguration can be used at multiple wavelengths simultane-\nously so as to “fill in the uv plane.\nA quite different problem, which is the focus of this paper, is\nthe fact that the short baseline lengths required for imaging\nthe brighter, and hence largest, GEO targets are not available\nat existing long-baseline interferometers. The one-metre-\nclass unit telescopes required for high sensitivity are not\ncompatible with close-packed interferometer configurations,\nand so the shortest baselines that have been utilised to date\nhave been ? 10 m in length. In the absence of such short,\n1-10 m, baseline data, other techniques, such as application\nof positivity and support \(i.e. field-of-view assist in reliable image recovery. A more advan-\ntageous method may be to secure the necessary low spatial\nfrequency samples of the Fourier plane with a more compact,\nbut still sensitive, short-baseline interferometer.\nIn this paper we propose the use of a separate large diameter\nAO-corrected telescope operating in an interferometric mode\nto secure these data. More specifically, we are proposing the\nuse of a non-redundant aperture mask \(NRM the\nrelevant short baseline interferometric measurements. The\nuse of NRM methods for high-angular resolution interfer-\nometric imaging was first implemented over twenty years\nago [5,6] and has since become a relatively routine procedure.\nIn this approach a pupil plane mask with a non-redundant\nconfiguration of sub-apertures is used to convert a single\ntelescope into a multi-element interferometer \(see, e.g. [7 taken with such a set-up show the\nimage of the target crossed by multiple sets of interference\nfringes, and a Fourier analysis of sets of such interferograms\ngives the identical uv plane data that would have been 


secured\nwith a separated-element interferometer with the configura-\ntion of telescopes defined by the aperture mask. Astronomical\nimages derived from such experiments are diffraction-limited\nand frequently surpass the fidelity realised by AO-corrected\nfilled-aperture telescopes \(see, e.g. [8 the imaging process that the use of non-redundant\npupil affords.\nIn order to reach an appropriate sensitivity level, we pro-\npose here the use of a non-redundant mask coupled with\na conventional AO system. Such a hybrid approach was\nfirst investigated computationally in the 1990s [9, 10] but\nit was only much later that these ideas were validated on-\nsky [11]. The benefits of the combination of NRM and AO\nare manifold and include the following:\n• An aperture mask samples the low spatial frequencies of\nthe Fourier plane in a very similar way to that of a long\nbaseline interferometer. This facilitates the merging of the\ntwo interferometric datasets allowing existing long baseline\nimage recovery codes to be used straightforwardly;\n• The use of a mask removes the redundancy of the pupil,\nlimiting the so-called ”atmospheric noise” arising from mul-\ntiple physical baselines in the pupil contributing to any given\nspatial frequency. This can have a beneficial impact in\nreducing the variability of the AO-related transfer function;\n• By removing spatial fluctuations in the incoming wave-\nfronts, the AO system usefully increases the diameters of the\nsub-apertures that can be utilised in the non-redundant mask.\nThis provides enhanced sensitivity;\n• By freezing the atmospheric perturbations, the AO system\ndelivers a further level of sensitivity by allowing longer\nexposure times to be used. Aperture masking experiments\nare usually undertaken with exposure times comparable to\nthe atmospheric coherence time, t0. A good AO system\nwill allow an order of magnitude increase in this before any\nresidual temporal fluctuations in the AO-corrected wavefronts\n2\nrender the high angular resolution information compromised.\nThese expectations have been realised in recent experiments\nat the Palomar 200 inch telescope where an aperture mask\nwas used with the Palomar laser guide star \(LGS  faint as magnitude 12 in the\nnear-IR K band. This is at least a factor of 10 times fainter\nthan the brightest GEO targets, and within a factor of two\nof the median brightness of the current population of geo-\nsynchronous satellites. As LGS AO systems become more\neffective, aperture masked observations of even fainter GEO\ntargets will likely become possible, although in this regime,\nthe sensitivity of the separated element array providing the\nlong baseline data may become the limiting factor.\n3. IMAGING MODEL\nFor the imaging simulations presented here we have followed\nsimilar procedures to our most recent study of the feasibility\nof synthesis imaging of geo-synschronous targets [2] in as-\nsuming the availability of a second-generation long baseline\narray with ten unit telescopes, and separate fringe-tracking\nand science beam combiners. The fringe tracker is used to\nmonitor and control the atmospheric perturbations between\nnearest-neighbour pairs of telescopes, while the science beam\ncombiner mixes the signals from all pairs of telescopes to-\ngether so as to record interference fringes from all possible\nbaselines in the array. The individual telescopes are assumed\nto be 1.4 m in diameter, i.e. just over a few times r0 in size\nat 1.65µm. This represents a useful compromise between\nmaximising sensitivity and minimising the impact of spatial\nwavefront perturbations introduced by the atmosphere. The\nuse of moderate sized telescopes with local fast tip-tilt correc-\ntion can frequently reach sensitivity levels that are very close\nto those realised with arrays using much larger telescopes\nwith sophisticated AO systems [13].\nThese interferometric system parameters closely match those\nplanned for the MROI, currently under construction in south-\nern New Mexico. This second generation facility array has\nbeen planned to deliver model-independent images of faint\nand complex astronomical sources and its design and planned\nimplementation differs from other existing arrays in three key\nways:\n• It has been specified to have a sensitivity some 50 to 100\ntimes better than current arrays, primarily through very chal-\nlenging requirements on throughput and delivered wavefront\nquality. This has a direct bearing on its utility for geo-\nsynchronous target imaging;\n• It aims to utilise a much larger number of telescopes \(10 typically only 4–6 are used\nroutinely at most astronomical facility arrays — so as to\nsample the Fourier plane more rapidly and uniformly than is\nusual. This again is expected to have a major bearing on its\npotential role for imaging GEO targets where Earth-rotation\nsynthesis is not possible;\n• It had been designed with a large amount of automation,\ne.g. for internal alignment and pre-observation set-up, so as\nto make data collection as efficient in time as possible. The\nability to secure data in a time interval that is short compared\nto the time for the target to change its orientation will be key\nfor GEO observations.\nWe have assumed that all 10 array elements are available\nand that they are located in the same Y-shaped layout and\nwith identical inter-telescope separations as for the most\ncompact MROI configuration. This is depicted in figure 1\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n 0\n 5\n 10\n 15\n 20\n-25 -20 -15 -10 -5  0  5  10  15  20\nN o\n?s\net \n/m\nE o?set /m\n-20\n-10\n 0\n 10\n 20\n-20 -10  0  10  20\nv /\nM?\nu /M?\nFigure 1. Array layout \(top bottom the MROI in its most compact configuration.\nIn the lower panel the radial “zoom” in the sampling is\nassociated 


with the five spectral channels that have been\nassumed across the near-IR H band at 1.65µm. The empty\nregion at the very center of the lower Fourier plane coverage\nplot is associated with the lack of baselines shorter than 8 m in\nthe array layout. It is this region that the single dish telescope\ndata populate.\nwhich also shows the instantaneous uv plane coverage for\na target at the zenith. In this configuration, the shortest\ninterferometer baseline is 7.8 m, while the maximum baseline\nis approximately 42 m. With a total of 10 telescopes, there\nwill be 45 instantaneous baselines, and with an assumed 5\nspectral channels across the near-IR H band, this implies a\nsampling of the Fourier plane at a total of 225 independent\nuv co-ordinates This is perhaps not as many as one might\nfavour, but is representative of what can probably be realised\nin the near term. Unlike our earlier preliminary study [2]\nwhere observations at 2.2µm were presented, we have chosen\nhere to model a situation where the imaging data are secured\nat 1.65µm while the atmosphere above the array is monitored\nat 2.2µm. This is attractive for two reasons: first, the science\ndata will have 30% better angular resolution than at 2.2µm,\nand second, the atmospheric monitoring will be improved\nbecause the object will be less resolved at longer wavelengths\nand hence the fringe contrasts in the fringe-tracking channels\nwill in general be greater.\n3\n-4\n-3\n-2\n-1\n 0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n-4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4\nv /\nM?\nu M?\nFigure 2. Mask layout \(top bottom non-redundant\nmask. The filled region in the center of the upper panel\nrepresents the typical secondary obscuration of a typical\n8 m diameter telescope. The mask has sub-apertures of 1 m\ndiameter and shortest and longest inter-sub-pupil distances of\n1 m and 6 m respectively. The Hermitian-symmetric copies\nof a given Fourier data point are shown in the lower panel as\nfilled circles and circles with dots in the centre respectively.\nNote that all the spatial frequencies fit within the central\n“empty” core of the Fourier plane coverage shown in figure 1.\nAs far as the short baseline data are concerned, we have as-\nsumed the use of an 8 m single dish telescope with a moderate\norder AO system feeding corrected wavefronts through a 9-\nhole non-redundant mask to a fast-readout near-IR camera.\nThe mask provides good 2-dimensional uv plane coverage\nwith baseline lengths ranging from just over 1 metre to around\n6 metres. In good seeing conditions i.e. 0.7 seconds of\narc sub-aperture diameter of\n1 m. A schematic illustration of the non-redundant mask is\nshown in figure 2 which also shows its corresponding uv\nplane coverage.\nWhile the short and long baseline interferometric data need\nnot be collected simultaneously, it will be important that any\ntime interval between them being secured is small compared\nto the time with which a GEO target may change its ori-\nentation significantly with respect to the observers and its\nillumination. The MROI design goal is to allow capture\nof target data on its 45 instantaneous baselines within 10\nminutes, after which a similar period of time will be needed\nfor calibration observations on unresolved targets. We have\nassumed that this is fast enough that changes in the target\norientation will not be an issue. This timescale is consistent\nwith the time needed to secure the aperture-masked data for\nwhich perhaps several hundred ? 1 second interferograms\nwill be required. In a similar vein, it is not required that\nthe single telescope and the long baseline interferometer be\nco-located although the illuminations and orientations of the\ntarget must be similar enough that the data can be fused on\nthe assumption of an identical brightness distribution at the\nangular resolution of the long baseline array.\nFor both the long and short baseline data we assume that the\nbasic observables are the power spectrum and bispectrum of\nthe target brightness distribution. While the use of a perfect\nAO system on a single telescope might allow true Fourier\nphases to be recovered from individual interferograms, in\npractice this is likely to be corrupted by residual sub-aperture\n“piston” phase errors. Closure phases are used here because\nthey are much more robust against these types of residual\nwavefront perturbations.\nWhere the long and short baseline data will differ most\nwill be in the assumed detector integration time. For the\nlong baseline measurements, we have assumed an observing\nscenario where slow, and hence sensitive, group delay fringe\ntracking is performed in the 2.2µm K band, and where\nthe high resolution science data are secured using fast 2t0\nintegrations so as to freeze the seeing at 1.65µm. For the\nAO-corrected NRM observations we have assumed a much\nlonger exposure time of one second, i.e. we have taken as\na given that the LGS AO system can maintain lock for at\nleast this amount of time. Under these circumstances, and\nwith nine 1 m diameter sub-apertures feeding light to the\ntelescope focal plane, we anticipate that readout noise on\nthe camera will not be a limiting factor in compromising the\ninterferometric data.\n4. SIMULATIONS\nSimulations were performed for two representative GEO\ntarget morphologies to assess the impact of low spatial-\nfrequency sampling of the Fourier plane for sources with\ndifferent overall shapes and aspect ratios. Truth images were\nprepared using the TASAT software [14] and scaled so as to\nmimic one target with a moderate sized \(i.e. few metre long but with a pair of long and thin solar panels spanning\n27 m, and another with a larger bus and a single solar 


panel\nat one of its ends, with the panel having a largest dimension\nof 15 m. The large sizes of these targets suggest that they\nwould be relatively bright objects, and so we have prepared\nsimulated datasets for two different brightness levels, one\ncorresponding to a 1.65µm magnitude of 8, and the other\nfor a target six times fainter \(mH = 10 interferometric datasets were generated by computing the\nFourier transforms of the truth images at the spatial frequen-\ncies corresponding to the assumed MROI interferometric pro-\njected baselines and those sampled by the non-redundantly\nmasked single telescope. The targets were assumed to have a\nconstant structure across the near-IR H-band window: this\nis likely to be a valid assumption since this window only\n4\nextends from 1.5µm to 1.8µm. In order to best mimic\nexisting interferometric experiments, the long-baseline data\nwere computed for five separate narrow-band channels across\nthe H band, while the shorter baseline single telescope\nmeasurements were assumed to be broad-band single channel\nmeasurements.\nThese Fourier data were then used to calculate noise-free val-\nues for the relevant interferometric observables, i.e. squared\nvisibilities and bispectra, and these were then corrupted so as\nto mimic realistic observations for the two target brightnesses\nunder study Experience has shown that most aperture mask-\ning experiments are usually limited by calibration errors and\nso for the results presented here we have included significant\ncalibration errors on the short baseline power spectra and bis-\npectra. Fractional errors of 10% were assumed for ?V 2/V 2\nwhile 5? errors were added to the closure phases. These are\nmuch larger than is typical for bright-source NRM observa-\ntions, but since no reports of AO-assisted NRM imaging of\nGEO targets exist in the open literature, we felt it would be\nprudent to use very conservative numbers here. For the long\nbaseline array data more detailed modelling of system perfor-\nmance is available and so we used the MROI error budget to\ncompute the signal-to-noise expected for a switchable 6-beam\nimage plane H-band beam combiner using a detector with\n4e? readout noise and subject to the residual atmospheric\nand instrumental coherence losses expected for the assumed\ntarget brightnesses and good seeing of 0.7 second of arc.\nFurther errors were added to account for imperfect calibration\nof the interferometric transfer function, these being at the\nlevel of ?V 2/V 2 = 0.02 for the Fourier amplitudes and\n0.8? for the closure phases. Due to the switchable beam\ncombiner architecture, five successive configurations of the\nfast optical switchyard feeding the combiner were assumed,\nyielding measurements on 5 15 = 75 baselines, each at\nfive spectral wavebands simultaneously. Hence the simulated\nMROI datasets comprised a total 375 Fourier data at 225\nunique coordinates in the uv plane.\nThe simulated squared visibilities and bispectra were saved\nin the OIFITS format [15] and then used as input to the\nBSMEM image reconstruction code 16]. The OIFITS stan-\ndard allows for the inclusion of multiple sets of Fourier\ndata, with associated errors all of which can correspond to\ndifferent samplings of the Fourier plane and different types\nof observables Here, our OIFITS files either contained the\nlong baseline array power spectra and bispectra alone, or also\nincluded the short baseline power spectrum and bispectrum\nmeasurements sampled by the non-redundant mask All the\ndata are treated equivalently by the BSMEM code in the\nsense that it simply aims to determine the sky brightness\ndistribution most consistent with the superset of the data and\ntheir errors.\nWe followed a very similar strategy for the reconstructions\nas before, employing a two-step scheme that we have used\nin the past for our entries to the IAU-sponsored beauty\ncontests [17]. First, the highest spatial frequencies corre-\nsponding to the noisiest data — were removed and BSMEM\nwas run with a circular Gaussian prior image The resulting\npreliminary image was then low-pass filtered by convolving\nit with a circular Gaussian and any pixel values below a user-\nselected threshold were set to zero. The resulting image was\nthen used as the prior for a second run of BSMEM on the full\ndataset, with no additional user intervention so as to mimic as\nunbiased an observation and reconstruction as possible.\n5. RESULTS\nFigure 3 shows the results of our image reconstructions for\nthe target with a pair of 11 m long solar panels in the ”bright\nsource” regime \(mH = 8 and whose longest dimension is\n27 m. In this and all the subsequent reconstructions presented\nhere, the leftmost image shows the truth data smoothed to\nthe diffraction limited resolution of the combined dataset the\ncentral panel shows the reconstruction from the long baseline\narray data alone, and the right hand panel is the image recov-\nered where the additional short spacing data from the non-\nredundant aperture masked telescope have been included.\nThe value of the short baseline measurements is immediately\napparent from figure 3. While the image recovered from\nthe long baseline data shows the correct orientation of the\nsolar panels and the presence of a central bus, much of the\nfiner detail in the reconstruction has appeared in the wrong\nplace Despite the high signal-to-noise ratio of the data, the\nsolar panels appear very different in brightness and shape\nto each other and the bus appears to be split into two parts.\nFurthermore, there is noticeable background noise across the\nwhole field of view defined by the prior image used for the\nsecond stage of the reconstruction procedure.\nThe image recovered from the combined short and long\nbaseline data \(right hand panel 


of figure 3 faithfully, but many of the finer details\nof the satellite bus are clear, and there is very little spurious\noff-target noise. This type of behaviour is evident at fainter\ntarget brightnesses too \(see figure 4 shortest interferometric spacings allows\nfor the correct orientation of the target’s solar panels to be\nvisualised as well as the basic structure of satellite bus to\nbe assessed. The much lower signal-to-noise of the data\nundoubtedly has an impact on the imaging fidelity, but the\nlow level of spurious noise in the field of view is very evident.\nThe extent to which these initial results are a function of the\ntarget morphology can be assessed by examining the results\nshown in figures 5 and 6. Here, the target does not have\na single predominant axis in its brightness distribution and\nits flux is distributed over multiple large two-dimensional\nstructures. This presents a much more challenging problem\nfor any image reconstruction procedure that has access to\nonly limited regions of the Fourier plane, and this was con-\nfirmed by our simulations. Even in the high light, and hence\nhigh signal-to-noise, regime it was impossible to recover a\nreliable image from the long baseline interferometer data\nalone \(central panel of figure 5 images\ndepended sensitively on the choice of parameters for the blur\nand threshold used in the initial reconstruction step, and in no\ncase were we able to recover an image that correctly captured\neven the basic structure, i.e. an offset bus with a single large\nrectangular solar panel, of the target.\nAs soon as the short baseline NRM data were included,\nimmediate benefits in performance were realised. The overall\nsatellite morphology was faithfully reconstructed, and much\nof the finer detail seen in the truth image was discernible,\nincluding the circular antennae, the diagonal shadow on the\nbus and the grid pattern on the solar panel. Furthermore, the\nreconstructions were robust to changes in the starting point\nand parameters of the imaging procedure and so routinely\nconverged to the same final image. Overall, the imaging\nfidelity was comparable to that achieved with the first tar-\nget. At lower signal levels — once again, we repeated the\nsimulations for a target six times fainter \(see figure 6 pixels pixels pixels pixels 50\n50\n100\n \(pixels pixels left image reconstructions for a bright, mH = 8, GEO target with an extent of\n27 m in its longest dimension. In the middle panel, only the long baseline data obtained with a 10-element MROI-type have\nbeen assumed, whereas in the right-hand panel additional data secured with a non-redundantly masked 8 m-class telescope have\nbeen included. The increase in imaging fidelity when short baseline measurements are available is very obvious. The angular\nresolution of the truth image is 8 milliarcseconds, which corresponds to roughly 1.4 m at geo-synchronous altitude.\n50 100 150 200 250\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n \(pixels pixels 50\n50\n100\n \(pixels pixels pixels pixels left reconstructions for the same target as for figure 3 but for a source\nbrightness roughly six times fainter \(mH 10 from 8 m to 42 m, while the rightmost panel shows the type of improvement realised if additional\ninterferometric measurements secured on 1–6 m baselines are provided to the image reconstruction code.\nmain impact was to lower the signal-to-noise ratio on the long\nbaseline data, and hence reduce the level and fidelity of the\nfine detail in the reconstructions. In the absence of the short\nbaseline data, these fine details frequently appeared at quasi-\nrandom locations over the field of view, and as before it was\nimpossible to identify even the most rudimentary large scale\nfeatures of the target. The combined dataset was much more\nuseful, showing both the large and smaller structures in the\nsource, albeit with poorer angular resolution than at higher\nlight levels.\n6. DISCUSSION\nThe results of our simulations reveal quite clearly the im-\nportance of short baseline measurements, that is, low angu-\nlar resolution data, for high fidelity imaging of large geo-\nsynchronous satellites. The results presented here should\nbe contrasted with those in our previous paper [2] which\ndemonstrated that a separated-element interferometer alone\ncan image slightly smaller satellites \(. 24 m 2.2µm versus\n1.65µm that these simulations \(as well as our earlier pa-\nper high-signal-\nto-noise coverage of the low spatial frequencies is not re-\nquired for successful imaging of satellites, which have rel-\natively simple large-scale structure. Additional simulations\n\(not shown smaller calibration errors on the aperture-\nmasking data did not exhibit any appreciable improvement\nin the quality of the reconstructed images. Although the\nassumptions made here about the accuracy of the NRM cal-\nibration are probably very conservative, our experience with\nthese additional simulations suggests that 


had we assumed the\nuse of better calibrated data, this would likely not have altered\nour assessment of the viability of interferometric imaging of\nGEO targets using our proposed scheme.

A new generation of near-infrared\nAPD array detectors from companies such as SELEX offers\nthe prospect of sub-electron readout noise, which would give\na significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio on long\nbaselines compared with the 4e? noise assumed for these\nsimulations. Adoption of these detectors would also enable\nuseful observations of faint targets in the J band \(1.25µm coverage to deliver 30% higher angular resolution.\nWe have shown that aperture-masked observations at a large\nAO-equipped conventional telescope can in principle be com-\nbined with measurements from a separated-element inter-\nferometer to realise large improvements in imaging quality.\nHowever, there are significant practical obstacles to securing\nsuch data, which we do not wish to understate. The obser-\nvations must be secured at locations and times such that both\nthe illumination of the satellite by the sun and the apparent\norientation of the solar panels \(which rotate to track the Sun considerations demand\nabove-average seeing at both telescope sites. The observa-\ntions could be obtained on different nights \(on the assumption\nthat no material change to the satellite had occurred the scheduling issues somewhat. On the other\nhand, our proposed approach makes use of general purpose\nastronomical facilities and hence is likely to be far more cost-\n7\neffective than building a dedicated telescope or interferometer\nfor observations of GEO targets alone.\n7. SUMMARY\nWith the emergence of sensitive optical/IR synthesis arrays\nsuch as the MROI, optical interferometric imaging will po-\ntentially offer an important capability for space situational\nawareness, allowing satellites in geo-synchronous orbit to\nbe identified and apparent damage to be assessed. We have\npresented results which illustrate the impact of a lack of short\nbaselines on the quality of the images reconstructed from\ninterferometer data, as well as the viability of a solution to\nthis problem for large \(& 20 m interferometric data obtained by non-redundant\nmasking of an AO-equipped 8–10 m telescope.\nThe application of the proven NRM technique to GEO imag-\ning, in combination with separated-element interferometry,\noffers a number of advantages over the use of an interferom-\neter array alone:\n• Imaging of the larger half of the GEO size distribution is\nenabled;\n• Since larger satellites are brighter, the chance of developing\na successful capability is greatly improved;\n• The need for using strong prior information \(which would\notherwise be required in difficult cases presented here conclusively\ndemonstrate that a useful quality and fidelity of imaging can\nbe obtained for GEO targets of a realistic size and brightness,\npaving the way for further investigation of the technical\nchallenges associated with these types of observations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank the UK’s STFC for continued support\nfor work on high angular resolution imaging methods at the\nUniversity of Cambridge and their colleagues at New Mexico\nTech for encouraging this study.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Creech-Eakman, M.C Romero, V., Payne, I., et al.,\n“The Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer:\na status update”, 2012, Proc SPIE 8445, 84450P-\n84450P-10\n[2] Young, J.S., Haniff, C.A., Buscher, D.F., Creech-\nEakman, M., Payne, I

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
