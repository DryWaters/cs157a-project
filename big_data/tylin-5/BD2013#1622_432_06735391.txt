Virtual Screening often uses SVM, a\nsupervised machine learning technique used for regression and\nclassi?cation analysis. Virtual screening using SVM not only\ninvolves huge datasets, but it is also compute expensive with\na complexity that can grow at least up to O\(n2 datasets. As an alternative to MPI,\nMapReduce, and its different implementations, have been suc-\ncessfully used on commodity clusters for analysis of data for\nproblems with very large datasets. Due to the large libraries\nof molecule structures in virtual screening, it becomes a good\ncandidate for MapReduce. In this paper we present a MapReduce\nimplementation of SVM based virtual screening, using Spark,\nan iterative MapReduce programming model. We show that our\nimplementation has a good scaling behaviour and opens up the\npossibility of using huge public cloud infrastructures ef?ciently\nfor virtual screening.\nIndex Terms—MapReduce, Big Data, Spark, Chemoinformat-\nics, Parallel SVM\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAs a result of the recent advancements in information tech-\nnology and instrumentation, scientists produce massive data\nsets at an extensive and increasing rate. Examples of scienti?c\nproblems generating large datasets are next-generation DNA\nSequencing [1] in Biomedical computing, next generation\nsynoptic sky surveys [2] in Astronomy and weather research\nand forecast [3] in Meteorology. While todays scientist are\nprivileged to have these huge data sets to study, the increasing\nsize, complexity and structure of this data, creates novel\nchallenges for the scientists to process and analyze the data.\nWith the data being complex and of unstructured nature con-\nventional relational databases are not suitable for manipulating\nthis data. Similarly conventional data mining techniques used\npreviously by the scientists now struggle to cope with the\nlarge data sets. With all these problems at hand, the need and\nimportance of parallel applications becomes more apparent\nand important A number of parallel programming frameworks\nhave been introduced in the recent past e.g. threads, MPI,\nOpenMP and MapReduce. Of these MPI has been the most\npreferred parallel framework for a long period of time. With\nits diverse set of constructs, MPI allows to communicate in\ndifferent ways e.g. point-to-point communication or collective\ncommunication.\nIn 2005, Google produce its famous paper [4] on the\nMapReduce framework, explaining the idea of using two basic\nfunctions, map and reduce, for the processing of large datasets.\nComparing MapReduce with MPI, MPI is more ?exible and\ncan be used in variety of applications. However, when the\nsize of the data is large, MPI becomes complex to use and\nis less practical [5]. MapReduce especially shines when the\nsize of the datasets is large and computation to perform\nis relatively simple. In MapReduce all the Map processes\nand Reduce processes execute independently and have weak\nsynchronization. Thus if a process fails it can be easily rerun\nwithout effecting any other process. MapReduce is mostly\nused for data-intensive tasks but a number of studies [6], [7]\nshow that it can be extended to compute-intensive problems,\ntoo. The signi?cant advantage of MapReduce is that it provides\nparallelization, fault-tolerance, data distribution and load bal-\nancing in a single framework, all transparent and already done\nfor the user. Furthermore, by using MapReduce we open up the\npossibility to use huge public cloud infrastructures for these\nkinds of problems Hadoop [8] is the most widely used open\nsource implementation of MapReduce. It has been extensively\nused at organizations like Facebook, Amazon etc. Another\nwell-known alternative is Dryad [9], produced by Microsoft.\nIn eScience there is an increasing number of applications,\nincluding data mining, web ranking graph processing, model\n?tting etc. that are based on iterative algorithms. The standard\nMapReduce framework is based on an acyclic data ?ow model\nand does not have built-in facilities for iterative programs.\nManually programming and chaining multiple MapReduce\ntasks together, by providing the output of the previous MapRe-\nduce as the input of the next MapReduce can accomplish\niterative programs. This use of MapReduce to achieve iterative\nanalysis of large data sets results in a number of limita-\ntions [11]. Before each MapReduce iteration, the data has to be\nreread and reprocessed, resulting in additional cost in network\nbandwidth, I/O and CPU. This is the case even when most\nof the data per iteration remains unchanged. Secondly, within\neach MapReduce iteration, we need to check for convergence\nto decide if we should end the iterative process. We also\nmight have to add extra MapReduce steps in each iteration to\nvalidate the termination condition, causing cost of additional\ntasks, reload of additional data and data movement over\nthe network. Due to these issues a number of alternative\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science\n978-0-7695-5095-4/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CloudCom.2013.99\n27\nframeworks have been devised for iterative applications e.g.\nSpark [10], Twister [5], and Haloop [11].\nSpark [10] is an open source 


implementation of MapReduce,\nused for large data analytics. In addition to Sparks iterative\nimplementation of MapReduce, it has a number of novel\nfeatures including in-memory computing and fault tolerance,\nusing Resilient Distributed Datasets \(RDDs in\nconsiderable higher access rates. If the size of the analyzed\ndatasets is bigger than memory, the additional data will be\nautomatically stored on disk. RDDs bring in innovative fault\ntolerance into spark by making use of the concept lineage.\nThrough lineage RDDs remember all the transformations from\nwhich they have been derived and on failure, can roll back to\na state from which they can be reproduced.\nSVMs were developed by [12] for two-group classi?cation\nproblems and for some years it has become a popular tool\nfor solving problems in classi?cation, regression and novelty\ndetection. For many applications SVMs give better results than\nother techniques, however they are more resource demanding\nand compute intensive. For example, due to the computational\ncomplexity of SVM, which is at least O\(n2  consuming. Studies have\nbeen performed to increase the ef?ciency of SVM, for example\nthrough novel parallel implementations. [14] outlines the idea\nof parallelizing SVM by dividing data into small portions and\nthen use SVM to solve each small portion in parallel. Most of\nthese parallel implementations are based on MPI rather than\nMapReduce.\nOn the basis of the above discussion, we believe that\niterative MapReduce is a good choice for SVM based virtual\nscreening. In this study, we implemented parallel SVM based\nvirtual screening model using Spark that runs on commodity\nclusters. This will help us to understand the possible improve-\nments in performance of iterative MapReduce for SVM based\nvirtual screening. In our implementation the data and relevant\nlibraries are distributed on the nodes of a cluster, performing\nvirtual screening, separately and parallel on each dataset.\nWhile LibSVM [15] is used for training and classi?cation of\nmolecule structures, the implementation is performed using\nCDK [16] and Java.\nRest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we\npresent some details about SVM and its usage. In section 3,\nthe Spark programming model is described. In section 4, we\nprovide details about our implementation of virtual screening.\nSection 5 describes our experiments and results, followed by\nconclusions and future work in section 6.\nII. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES AND APPLICATIONS\nSupport vector machines \(SVM  problems. A SVM includes\na training algorithm that uses training examples, which are\nalready marked to one class or another, to build an SVM model\nthat predicts the new examples into one category or another.\nA SVM model represent training examples as points in space,\ndividing these examples into categories by a clear gap which\nFig. 1. SVM Linear Classi?cation\nis as wide as possible. In ?gure 1, hyperplane H1 separates the\ninput data into two categories by maximum-margin. Though\nH2 also separates the input data, but only with less or no\nmargin. Once training examples are categorized, new examples\nare then predicted on the basis that on which side of the gap\nthey fall in the same space.\nOther than linear classi?cation, SVM can also perform non-\nlinear classi?cation using the kernel trick originally proposed\nby [17]. Most of the Non-linear classi?cation algorithm is\nsame as linear SVM. The only difference is that a nonlinear\nkernel function is used instead of every dot product, thus\nenabling the algorithm to ?t the maximum-margin hyperplane\nin a transformed feature space. Figure 2 illustrates non-\nlinear classi?cation. SVM has been used in different areas. In\nFig. 2 Non-linear Classi?cation and Kernel Machine\nbioinformatics, they have been used to identify small organic\nmolecules [18] and to distinguish epoxide hydrolases \(EHs subfamilies using its\nprimary protein sequences [19]. [20] provides its usage for\npattern recognition. SVM has also been used in chemoinfor-\nmatics. In [21] and [22] are two examples where SVMs have\nbeen successfully used in the ?eld of chemoinformatics.\n28\nA. Virtual Screening and LibSVM\nVirtual screening \(VS ltering large collections\nof chemical structures to identify candidates that are likely\nto bind to a drug target [23]. Here we use the signature\ndescriptor [24] to describe the chemical structures numerically\nand SVM models to rank candidate structures according to the\ndesired predicted chemical properties, including inhibition of\ncancer cell lines as well as partition coef?cient \(clogP logS models such as HeRG and\nAhR inhibition as described in [25] and [26].\nLibSVM is the most used and ef?cient implementation of\nSVM. The tool provides facilities of support vector classi?ca-\ntion \(SVC regression \(SVR One-Class SVM classi?cation and regression models \(see\nabove 27] available in SDF\(structure-data  latency cluster computing\nsystem used for Big Data Analytics. It is compatible with\napache Hadoop and allows us to read data from any Hadoop\nsupported storage system or ?le format e.g. HDFS, Amazon\nS3, Sequence Files etc. With iterative and in-memory dataset\nprocessing, it is on average 10 times faster [10] than Hadoop.\nSpark can be speci?cally bene?cial for virtual screening for\nthe reasons that normally virtual screening is done on 


large\ndatasets and Spark is good at handling large datasets. Also\nin some cases, scientists want to test the same datasets with\nmany models. In such cases, Spark iterative MapReduce can be\nespecially useful keeping the datasets in memory to process it\niteratively using various models. Keeping datasets in memory\navoiding repeated re-reading from disk can save plenty of\nprocessing time. More details on Spark usage and constructs\nare as follows:\nA. Spark Programming Model\nTo use Spark, developers have to write driver programs In\nthe driver program, we can give the overall ?ow of control for\nour application and apply different operations in parallel. The\nfacilities provided for parallel programming are as follows:\n1 Distributed Datasets: A resilient distributed\ndataset \(RDD parti-\ntioned across a set of machines. If one of the partitions is\nlost, it can be restore by backward transformation, through\nlineage, thus providing fault tolerance without replication.\nRDDs are created by reading ?les from a shared ?le system\ne.g. Hadoop Distributed File System\(HDFS transformed by applying various available operations\ne.g. ?atmap. Optionally, RDDs can be kept in memory for\niterative in-memory processing using cache operation.\n2 differ-\nent parallel operations on the RDDs. E.g. reduce can be used\nto reduce the elements of the RDD from parallel machines or\ncollect which returns all elements of the datasets in the RDD\nto the driver program.\n3 Shared Variables: Other than normal variables, spark\nprovides special type of shared variables for two special cases.\nWhen there is huge size data that is only readable, broadcast\nvariables can be used. Broadcast variables are only distributed\nonce to the workers, rather than with every single parallel\noperation. The second situation is when worker nodes need\nsome variable, which the master node can only read. E.g. if\nwe want to implement counters in MapReduce, these counters\ncan be used for parallel sums with a more imperative syntax.\nSuch variables are named as accumulators. Accumulators are\neasier to make fault tolerant, as they are add-only.\nIV. VIRTUAL SCREENING ON SPARK IMPLEMENTATION\nFor virtual screening, we have SDF ?les, which contain\nthe molecule structure. We classify these molecules using\nLibSVM that creates models and then predict them using\nthese models. This is basic investigation of Spark for virtual\nscreening where we only use two SVM models to predict\nmolecules structures.\nFig. 3. Tools and Infrastructure\nA. Tools and Infrastructure\nIn this study, we have used an OpenNebula [28] based\nprivate cloud infrastructure. OpenNebula is cloud creation and\nmanagement software that allows you to launch, delete, and\nclone VMs and images. The user can either use OpenNebula\ncommand line interface \(CLI our experiments we\nfound that currently the GUI based interface is not fully stable\nand we used CLI for our cluster management.\nOn top of our Open Nebula private cluster, we used the\nHadoop Distributed File System\(HDFS   different than other distributed ?le systems\nin terms that it is fault tolerant and can be used on commodity\nhardware. It allows quick access to application data and is\nmost suitable when applications have very large datasets. In\naddition the datasets can be replicated for fault tolerance\nrequirement. For data processing and analysis, we used Spark,\nas already discussed in section III. Based on these services we\n29\ndeveloped our virtual screening application further described\nin the following section.\nB. Architecture of Parallel Virtual Screening\nOur parallel virtual screening is based on master-worker\narchitecture as shown in ?gure 4. The master machine acts as\nNameNode of HDFS and the worker node is used as DataNode\nof HDFS. Once the SDF ?les get copied to our private cluster,\nNameNode divides each SDF ?le into blocks; the data blocks\nare distributed and kept at DataNode whereas NameNode\nonly contains the metadata about the dataset stored at each\nDataNode. NameNode also have ?le system namespace and\ncontrols how worker nodes can access the ?les. The number\nof blocks depends upon the size of the ?le. The number of\nblocks are calculated by the size of the ?le divided by the\nHDFS block size, which is normally 64MB in older versions\n128MB in newer versions. The data blocks contain the records,\nwhich are the smallest readable unit by the workers. In our\ncase one molecule structure acts as a record.\nFig. 4. Parallel Virtual Screening Architecture\nOnce the dataset gets distributed on the cluster, we process\nthese datasets using Spark MapReduce with Spark master dae-\nmons and worker daemons running at Master and Worker node\nrespectively as shown in ?gure 4. To transfer our application\ncode and all the dependencies including LibSVM and CDK,\nwe create a single jar ?le using Apache Maven [30]. The jar\n?le is then provided to Spark through SparkContext \(explained\nlater in section IV-C worker\nnodes. The bene?t is that all the dependencies are local to the\nworker nodes and don?t have to remotely fetch from network,\nthus reducing the overall processing time. The worker nodes\nprocess these datasets using MapReduce. Each worker node\nhas mappers and reducers. Since each block is assigned to\none mapper the parallelism and number of mappers depends\non the number of input blocks, whereas the number of reducers\ncan be changed through the driver program. Once the worker\nnodes complete the processing, the master node gets back 


the\n?nal result.\nC. Work Flow of driver program\nThe parallel virtual screening pseudo code based on spark\nis as follows:\nFig. 5. Flow of Program\nBefore executing the driver program, we make some prepa-\nrations. Master and workers nodes are speci?ed to Spark and\nHDFS in their speci?c con?guration ?les by providing corre-\nsponding IP addresses. There are many other con?guration\nvariables of Spark and HDFS that need to be set in their\nrespective con?guration ?les. For Spark we can e.g. set a\nSpark worker memory that will be available during processing\nby setting the SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY variable. Using a\ndistributed ?le system, as in our case HDFS, the data is then\ndistributed over the worker nodes before processing.\nIn addition we created a RunPrediction class which acts as\nthe driver program. In this class, we control the overall parallel\nprocessing of the datasets. In the initialization process, we\nread and initialize predictive models into memory using Sign-\nLibsvmModel class, which we have created separately. During\ninitialization, we also set different spark system properties. By\ndefault Spark uses all the cores available on the machine, while\nif the user want Spark to only use 4 cores, this is achieved by:\nSystem.setProperty\("spark.cores.max 4 jar ?le path that\nwe need to pass on to worker nodes. Next we read SDF ?les\ninto RDD using SparkContext. Spark allows us for reading text\n?les or those supported by Hadoop. SDF ?les cannot be read\nby built-in .textFile method which supports records\nbased on single line. For reading multiline molecules structure,\nwe need to have custom input format by extending the Hadoop\nFileInputFormat class and implement a record reader. In our\ncase we used the SDFInputFormat [31] class to read SDF\n?les. In the SDF ?le, each molecule is separated by $$$$\nand newline. The following code shows how we read the SDF\n?les, where the endTag represent the end of a molecule.\n30\nbyte[] endTag = "$$$$\\n".getBytes endTag,true created RDD, which contains SDF ?les, we\napply the map operation on all the RDDs. By applying the map\noperation a function is applied to all elements in the RDDs.\nInternally this function is executed separately in parallel on all\nthe mappers on the worker nodes as shown in ?gure 6.\nFig. 6. Molecule Prediction with MapReduce\nIn the map operation, we used CDK to read molecules into\nIAtomContainer object by parsing the string representation\nof the SDF record. Once parsed, we can manipulate these\nmolecules normally as done using CDK without parallelism\nand MapReduce. We calculate the signature of the molecules\nand then compare these molecules to the SVM models to ?nd\nthe predicted molecules. The mappers emit a key, value pair\nof molecules and associated value of 1 or 0, where 1 represent\na predicted molecule and 0 otherwise.\nif \(hergRes!=1 new Tuple2\(mol,1 mol,0 the\nmolecules with value 1.

In the parallel virtual screen-\ning experiment environment, we launched and used virtual\nmachines on our OpenNebula based cluster. All these virtual\nmachines are based on AMD 64bit architecture. Each VM acts\nas either a master node or a worker node. Each of the worker\nnodes have an internal memory of 2GB and with 2 cores each\nwhereas the master node has an internal memory of 10GB\nand 2 cores for processing. The master node normally doesn?t\nneed much memory but when the number of worker nodes\nincreases, it needs to have more memory to keep record of all\nthe worker nodes. Each node is installed with Debian OS.\nA. Parallel Virtual Screening Scaling\nIn this experiment we evaluate the performance of virtual\nscreening with increasing number of nodes/parallelism. The\ndataset used for this experiment is 10GB \(approximately The\ndetails about the experiment are illustrated by ?gure 7.\nFig. 7. Parallel Virtual Screening Scaling\nWe started with 10 worker nodes, increasing 4 nodes on\neach test. Initially, with the increasing number of nodes the\ntime is decreasing almost linearly, where with 10 nodes virtual\nscreening is completed in 49 minutes and with 26 nodes,\nits completed within 25 minutes. This suggests that virtual\nscreening can perform better with increasing number of nodes.\nAfter 26 nodes, the time does not decrease as rapidly and once\nwe increased nodes to 38, it ?attens out to 21 minutes. This\nshows that parallelization can be done to certain limits.\nB Performance with changing input split size\nIn this experiment, we evaluate how the parallel virtual\nscreening performs when we change the input split size. The\nnumber of nodes we used for this experiment are 22 i.e 44\ncores. During the evaluation we increased the total size of the\ndata, with a total number of 5 different sizes. We tested our\nimplementation with two different input split sizes, 64MB and\n128MB, as shown in ?gure 8.\nFig. 8. Changing Input Split\nIn this test, we found that increased input split size slows\ndown the execution time of our implementation. The reason is\n31\nthat increased input split size decreases the parallelism since\nthe number of mappers is inversely proportional to the input\nsplit size. With 128MB, we have 


fewer mappers than with\n64MB split size and thus less parallelism. This experiment\nalso answers why scaling was limited to a certain limit in the\nearlier experiment where our input split size was 64MB, and\nwe could have further parallelize it by decreasing the input\nsplit size to 32MB. This also shows that if the size of data is\nbig, one need to have bigger input split size and vise versa.\nVI. RELATED WORK\nWe see some studies where MapReduce based SVM has\nbeen used for different purposes. While most of these studies\nmake use of standard MapReduce, [32] is a study, which\nuses another iterative MapReduce implementation, Twister to\nevaluate possible improvements of the performance of parallel\nSVM. In this study, they showed that the computational time\ncould be greatly reduced by using the proposed twister based\nparallel SVM model.\nAnother Study [33] is about using Hadoop MapReduce\nto implement Docking of Large-Scale Virtual Screening. In\nthis study, authors explain how they stored small molecules in\nHDFS, and then applied MapReduce framework to it. In the\nMap Function, they executed molecular docking in parallel. In\nthe Reduce function, they collect the results. They also suggest\nthat the number of data blocks should be more than the number\nof DataNodes, so that every DataNode have blocks to process.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK\nIn this study, we used Spark, an iterative MapReduce\nprogramming model, for implementing SVM based virtual\nscreening. We showed how HDFS and Spark can be used in\ncombination to distribute and process data in parallel, pro-\nviding a satisfactory scaling behaviour and ef?ciency. While\ntraditionally SVM based applications are implemented in MPI,\nwe showed that MapReduce is a viable alternative that opens\nthe path for ef?cient exploitation of large-scale public cloud\ninfrastructures for virtual screening.\nThis was a basic study where we used only two SVM\nmodels to evaluate the ability of Spark for virtual screening.\nBased on this study, we will use Spark in future studies to\nimplement multi-model virtual screening.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work is partly funded through the Swedish e-Science\ninitiatives eSSENCE and SeRC.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.

segment \(referred to as the cache filter segmentation [18]\nand upload them into the key-value store. Regarding gridding,\nwe choose 1 second as the time granularity for discretization\nof a modeled segment. The gridding granularity is a parameter\ndepending on end-user requirements.\nB. Model-view sensor data vs. raw sensor data\nRaw sensor data is a set of discrete data points each of which\nhas associated timestamp and value. We create two tables,\nwhich respectively take the timestamp and sensor value as\nthe row-keys, such that the query range or point can be used\nas keys to locate the qualified data points. Then, the query\nprocessor invokes the MapReduce to access the large size of\ndata points for query results.\nFig. 5 \(a b c and point queries respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 5 \(a b than the raw sensor data method for\nboth time and value range queries. Although the raw sensor\ndata based methods apply MapReduce to directly access the\nqualified tuples via the row-key based range scan, the amount\nof raw sensor data to process is much larger than that of the\nmodel-view approach. In Fig. 5\(c processing time of the\nraw data based method is 2 x less than that of the model-view\none in time point queries, because the raw data method can\nuse the query time point as index key to directly access the\nrelevant data points, while our KSM requires to perform model\nfiltering and gridding. For value point queries, the model-view\napproach has nearly 3 x less time than the raw data method.\nAs normally there is a large size of data points with the query\nvalue, MapReduce is used to access this qualified sensor data\nset. In model-view approach, the point query processing only\nuses random access and range scan to get qualified modeled\nsegments for gridding locally, and thus it saves the time on\nstarting MapReduce to access data.\nC. Comparison of model-view approaches\nThere are four baseline approaches for querying model-view\nsensor data namely:\nMapReduce \(MR the whole\nindex-model table to filter the qualified modeled segments in\nthe mapping phase and perform the model gridding in the\nreduce phase.\nInterval tree \(IT operations of the interval tree [6], [9] by adding\nanother table to store the SS of each node sorted by the right\nend-point of intervals. Each index, time or value, has two\nassociated tables. During the intersection or point search on vs-\ntree, the query processor decides which table to access based\non the relation between the query range \(or point encountering one unqualified modeled segment, due to\nthe monotonicity of end-points of modeled segments. IT makes\nuse of random access and range scan to sequentially filter the\nqualified modeled segments and make gridding locally.\nMapReduce+KVI \(MRK process the whole\ntable. In MRK, MapReduce is designed to work over one\ncontinuous sub-index-model table including all the SSs of\nthe accessed nodes in search operations. For instance, in Fig.\n4\(a or value  16, a >]. The same idea applies for point\nqueries. As compared to our hybrid KSM approach, MRK is\na lightweight indexing-MapReduce plan, as it processes many\nirrelevant SSs of nodes between So and V.\nFilter of key-value store \(FKV support\npredicate-based row selection. The filter transmits the filtering\npredicate to each region server and then all servers scan their\nlocal data in parallel. Afterwards, they return the qualified\ntuples. Our filter-based query processing also works on the\nindex-model table, as the filtering predicates can be directly\napplied to the columns. The query processor waits until all\n288\nFig. 5. Query performance of range and point queries\nregion servers finish scans and then it retrieves each returned\nqualified modeled segment to conduct gridding locally.\n1 a b c queries. As depicted in Fig.6\(a the query selectivity increases, the amount of SSs\nfor scan based processing decreases and that for MapReduce\napproaches the entire table. Therefore, the response time\nincreases and approaches that of MR. The response time of\nMR increases little. As increasing query selectivity leads to\nascending gridding workload in reduce phase, these results\nshow that the overhead from model gridding is not dominant\nin MR. The response time of MRK is more than that of KSM,\nbut less than that of MR. As MRK utilizes the KVI-index\nto localize a consecutive sub-index-model table covering all\nthe SSs of nodes found by intersection search, it processes\nfewer modeled segments than MR's full table scanning. Yet,\nas compared to KSM, MRK processes more redundant modeled\nsegments. Moreover, as the sub-table in MRK covers a large\nrange, the processing time of MRK increases little for low-\nselective queries.\nFig.6\(b FKV needs to wait for each region server of\nHBase to finish the local data scanning, its total response time\nis a little longer than that of IT approach. They both consume\nmuch more time than all MR, MRK and KSM 


as they apply\nsequential accessing of modeled segments.\nWe also analyse the number of modeled segments accessed\nby each approach in Fig. 6\(c segments affect\nthe performance. MR works on the entire table, thus, the\nnumber of accessed segments is the same. From the point\nof view of the application, only qualified modeled segments\nare returned for gridding thus FKV processes no redundant\nmodeled segments and consumes the least amount of modeled\nsegments. Since IT scans the SS of one node until encountering\nan unqualified model, the total number of accessed segments\nis a little larger than that of FKV. Our KSM processes larger\nnumber of segments than both IT and FKV due to the\ncontinuous and redundant range of SSs found by isearch+.\nHowever, the results also verify our theoretical analysis that\nthe amount of redundant modeled segments is bounded. MRK\naccesses more segments than IT, FKV and KSM, as it adds\nthe SSs between So and V to form a continuous sub-table\nfor MapReduce. Referring to Fig. 6\(a and Fig. 6\(b efficient.\nFig. 6 \(d e f approaches exhibit\nsimilar patterns as for the time range queries, so we skip the\ndetailed analysis.\n2 Query: The time and value point query processing\nperformance are shown in Fig. 6\(g value point queries. The response time of KSM is a little\ngreater than IT, but outperforms the other approaches, because\nIT is able to access all qualified modeled segments in one SS.\nHowever, the KSM scans the whole SS entries of a node to find\nthe qualified ones. Because of the invocation of MapReduce\nand redundant modeled segments in the sub-table, MRK takes\nmore time than both IT and KSM. But, as MRK does not work\non the entire table as MR does, it takes about 2 x less time\nthan MR. FKV consumes the most time as it needs to wait for\nserver-side full table scan before gridding operations. Since the\nsize of the domain of the sensor data values is smaller than\nthat of the time domain, nodes in value vs-tree accommodate\nmore modeled segments than time vs-tree nodes. Thus, the\nresponse times of value point queries of IT, FKV and KSM\napproaches are all more than those of time point queries. For\nMR and MRK, the processing time differences between time\nand value queries are insignificant, as the time spent on model\nfiltering and gridding is not dominant.\nD. Insights into KVI-Scan-MapReduce\nThis experiment aims to reveal how much time KSM spends\non model gridding, which is an additional step, as compared\nto querying raw sensor data. Due to space constraints, we only\nshow the results from time range queries of selectivity from\n10% to 50%. From Fig. 6\(h for 1/3 - 1/2 of the total processing time. As the\nmajority of the gridding work is performed in the reduce phase\nand the amount of qualified segments for reducers depends\non the query selectivity, the time spent on model gridding\nincreases with the query selectivity. If the model gridding can\nadapt to users' different requirements for query results, the\nperformance of KSM can be further improved.\n289\nFig. 6. Query performance a c d g g h constitution\nVII. CONCLUSION\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\nexplore the key-value representation of an interval index for\nmodel-view based sensor data management. Different from\nconventional external-memory index structure with complex\nnode merging and split mechanisms, our KVI-index resident\npartially in memory and partially materialized in the key-value\nstore, is easy to maintain in the dynamic sensor data generation\nenvironment. Moreover, we proposed a hybrid query pro-\ncessing approach, namely KVI-Scan-MapReduce, integrating\nthe KVI-index, range scan and MapReduce for model-view\nsensor data in key-value stores. Extensive experiments in a\nreal testbed showed that our approach outperforms in terms\nof query response time and index updating efficiency not only\nquery processing methods based on raw sensor data but also\nall other approaches considered based on model-view sensor\ndata for time/value range and point queries. As a future work,\nwe plan to explore how to process time and value composite\nqueries based on KVI-index.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S. Sathe, T. G. Papaioannou, H. Jcung, and K.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual

Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
