GPS REFLECTOMETRY AND UK-DMC \nFor some years, GPS receivers have been used to provide \nposition, velocity and time knowledge to satellite platforms \nin low Earth orbit in a similar way to ground-based satellite \nnavigation receivers. Surrey is a leading experimenter and \nprovider of COTS-based GPS receivers for small satellites. \nAs well as navigation, GPS signals have been increasingly nused for remote sensing. Signals at L-band with a 2-20 MHz \nbandwidth are being broadcast globally from a 20,000 km \naltitude and can be used to measure, amongst other things, \ntectonic plate motion and ionospheric and tropospheric \nparameters. Furthermore, signals from other Global \nNavigation Satellite Systems \(GNSS becoming \navailable, and there will soon be more than 120 signal \nsources in space. \nSpaceborne GNSS Retlectometry uses GNSS signals that \nhave been retlected off the Earth's surface to measure \ngeophysical parameters. The potential for GNSS \nRetlectometry was demonstrated on the UK-DMC mission \nby SSTL and the University of Surrey in 2003 [1]. A nadir \npointing antenna, just under 12 dBiC, had a 3 dB field of \nview of approximately 20° x 70°, permitting collection of as \nmany as three retlected signals simultaneously. The nprimary mode of operation on the first experiment was the \ncollection of sampled IF data into a data-recorder, typically \n20 seconds, and downloading for post processing on the \nground. The raw data was processed on the ground into \nDelay Doppler Maps \(DDMs of signal returns off ocean, land \nand ice. Two example DDMs are shown in Fig. 1; they \nmeasure the spread in energy away from the specular point, \nand the spread grows as the surface becomes rougher. \nA substantial effort into the modeling of signal returns has \nbeen undertaken based on data from the first UK-DMC nexperiment with the intention to assess inversion of sea state \nparameters [2,3] and the retrieval of directional roughness \ninformation [4,5]. Although severely band-limited, the \ncollection of retlected Galileo signals \(from GlOVE-A indicates the potential of GNSS \nRetlectometry for ice edge mapping. [6]. The UK-DMC \nexperiment demonstrated the feasibility for many remote \nsensing applications but limited space-based data is \navailable for robust assessment of the geophysical retrieval \naccuracy of GNSS-R. \n376 \n378 \n:;. 380 \n:E \nu ? 382 \n8 384 « \nu \n386 n388 \n8000 7000 .8000 9000 \n_Hz \n'0000 11000 \n-10000 -9000 -8000 -7000 -6000 -5000 -4000 -3000 \nDoppler Hz nFig. I Example Delay-Doppler Maps from UK-DMC GPS-R Experiment \na reflection \n3. DEVELOPMENT OF THE SGR-RESI \nThe UK-DMC experiment highlighted the potential that a 


nmicrosatellite-compatible passive instrument may be able to \nmake valuable geophysical measurements using GPS nretlectometry. A future experiment would be necessary to \ncontinue the demonstration and gather a larger quantity of \ndata. If possible, the instrument should be capable of \nprocessing the raw data into Delay Doppler Maps in real­\ntime. \nSurrey teamed with National Oceanographic Centre in \nSouthampton and with other partners, University of Surrey, \nUniversity of Bath, and Polar Imaging Ltd to develop a new \nGNSS Retlectometry instrument for this purpose. \nA schematic of the SGR-ReSI \(Space GNSS Receiver -\nRemote Sensing Instrument  three separate units on previous spacecraft. \n978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©20131EEE \n2 \na core functions of a space GNSS \nreceiver, with front-ends supporting up to 8 single \nor 4 dual frequency antenna ports. \nb data in its 1 \nGByte solid state data recorder \nc Virtex 4 1MB TMR 16MB 16.367 1 \nMHz \nReflectometry \nProcessing Unit \nReprogrammable \nCo-processor \nSRAM DSP FPGA \nFig. 2 GNSS Reflectometry Instrument Configuration \nThe co-processor was specifically included for the real-time nprocessing of the raw retlected GNSS data into Delay­\nDoppler Maps \(DDMs nprogrammed in orbit as required for different purposes, for \nexample to track new GNSS signals, or to apply spectral \nanalysis to received signals. \nFor the co-processor to generate Delay Doppler Maps of the \nsampled retlected data, it needs to be primed with the PRN, \nthe estimated delay and the estimated Doppler of the nretlection as seen from the satellite. These are calculated by \nthe processor in conjunction with the main navigation \nsolution - the data tlow for this is shown in Fig. 3. Direct \nsignals \(from the zenith antenna are used to acquire, track \nGNSS signals. From the broadcast Ephemerides, the GNSS \nsatellite positions are known. Then from the geometry of \nthe position of the user and the satellites, the retlectometry \ngeometry can be calculated, and hence an estimate of the \ndelay and Doppler of the retlection. \nFig. 3 GNSS Reflectometry Dataflow \nThe processing of the Delay Doppler Map is performed on \nthe coprocessor using data directly sampled from the nadir \nantenna \(Fig. 4 board the co­\nprocessor. As an alternative to synchronising and decoding \nthe retlected signal in a standalone manner, the direct \nsignals can be used to feed the navigation data sense, and \nassist the synchronisation The sampled data is multiplied \nby a replica carrier and fed into a matrix that performs an \nFFT on a row by row basis of the Delay Doppler Map, to \nachieve in effect a 7000 channel correlator, integrating over \n1 millisecond. Each point is then accumulated incoherently \nover hundreds of milliseconds to bring the weak signals out \nof the noise. \nFig. 4 Delay Doppler Map Processing \nThis processing is performed in real-time on board the \nsatellite and greatly reduces the quantity of data required to \nbe stored and for the satellite's downlink, enabling a larger \nnumber of retlections to be captured across the globe. Initial \nimplementation has been to predict and track a single \nretlection from a single downward pointing antenna. It is \nplanned however, to implement in the Flight Model \(Fig. 5 nsimultaneously from two nadir antennas giving an increased \nswath. \nSGR·ReSI \nFlight Model \(2 2011 \n4. TESTING THE SGR-RESI \nPerforming an end-to-end test of the operation of the SGR­\nReSI in retlectometry mode is quite a challenge as no \nsimulator has been available to date that could generate the nfull GPS signals with appropriate delay and Doppler spread \nas expected once retlected off a rough ocean However, tests \ncan be performed that thoroughly exercise different parts of \nthe instrument in an orbital representative way. \n1 using a Spirent multichannel \n978·1-4673·1813·6/13/$31.00 ©20131EEE \n3 \nGPS simulator as if the receiver were in orbit. This tests the \nsignal acquisition, tracking and data logging from different \nantennas. \n2 under simulation or connected to live signals, the \nraw sampled data can be stored into the data recorder for 1-2 \nminutes.

DEMONSTRATION ON TECHDEMOSAT-l \nA technology demonstration satellite, TechDemoSat-1 \(see \nFig. 8 under sponsorship of \nthe recently formed UK Space Agency and with \ncontributions from the payload suppliers It is intended to be \nthe first of a series of UK technology satellites aiming to \nprovide a rapid affordable means of testing and proving the \nnext generation of space hardware in orbit. TechDemoSat-1 \nis based upon a standard SSTL design, the SSTL-150. With \nits 8 payloads, the satellite is approximately 160 kg. It is ncapable of accommodating around 52 watts of orbit-average \npower and can store up to 128 GBytes of payload data. It \nhas S-Band and X-Band downlinks capable of operating \nwith experimental downlink speeds up to 400 MBps. It has \n4 wheel slew agility, and new generation star trackers, \ngyros, magnetometers and torquerods nFig. 8 TechDemoSat-1 Model \(approx. 0.7 m cube, 160 kg payloads hosted on TechDemoSat-1 include \n Maritime Suite - Sea State Payload from SSTL \ncomprising SGR-ReSI and experimental altimeter. \n Space Environment Suite - radiation and charging \ninstruments provided by Surrey Space Centre, \nMSSL, Langton Star Centre and RAL \n Platform Technology - Cranfield, SSL, SciSys \n Air and Land Monitoring - Oxford lRAL. \nThe main two purposes of the SGR-ReSI on TechDemoSat-\n1 are to demonstrate its core GPS capability, and to \ndemonstrate the technology and science required for GPS \nRetlectometry through the operation and collection of data \nover the ocean. Secondary aims include demonstration of \nnew single and multi-frequency signals \(e.g. Galileo, \nG1onass, GPS L2C nradio-occultation demonstration, retlectometry over ice, \nsnow and land, attitude determination and GNSS ninterference detection. \nAlthough the SGR-ReSI can, in principle, support up to 4 \ndual frequency antennas, a reduced subset is being tlown on \nTechDemoSat-1 to support its planned applications. A left \nhand circularly polarised dual frequency Ll/L2 fixed phased \narray antenna \(gain 13 dBiC GNSS retlectometry. It is the opposite polarisation to \nconventional GNSS antennas and provides the higher gain \nrequired to receive the weak signals from GNSS retlections. \nA dual-frequency Ll/L2 antenna and two additional Ll \nantennas will occupy the space facing facet with more \ntypical RHCP and hemispherical patterns These antennas \nare intended to provide navigation function for the satellite \nand also support monitoring of radio occultation events with \nboth the Ll and L2 signals. The provision of three antennas \non the space facing facet with suitable baselines between \nthem also enables the SGR-ReSI to support GNSS based \nattitude determination as previously demonstrated by SSTL \non the UoSAT-12 and TopSat satellites. \nA new low noise amplifier has been designed that supports \nboth Ll and L2 frequencies, is equipped with a temperature \nsensor and a switched load to provide a known noise level \nwhen enabled for calibration purposes. One each will be nused on the nadir and zenith dual frequency antennas \nrespectively. The two Ll-only zenith antennas will use the \nheritage integrated Ll LNAs used with previous single \nfrequency GNSS receivers. \nAt the time of writing TechDemoSat-1 is scheduled for a \nlaunch in Q2 2013 on board a Russian launcher, and the \nfinal near-polar orbit has an approximately 680 km altitude. \nThe plans for operation of the payload require coordination \nwith all the other 7 payloads on the satellite, but a scheme of \ncycling through 8 days has been defined that permits full \noperation of the ReSI 1 or 2 days per 8 day cycle. Special \noperations on other occasions will be possible, subject to \nagreement with the other payload operators. \nSSTL is a partner in a project called WaveSentry [9] that is \nlooking to use wave information from multiple sources \nincluding buoys and ferries to generate a commercial wave \nnotification service. Another partner, National \nOceanographic Centre, is providing the algorithms for \ninversion, and these will be validated using the \nmeasurements from TechDemoSat-l. \n6. THE SGR-RESI ON CYGNSS \nThe requirements on the SGR-ReSI for CYGNSS are \ndifferent from TechDemoSat-1 as there is more of a focus \non the autonomous operational mode for hurricane sensing nPriorities include signal to noise ratio and signal coverage \noptimization, and there is less of a need for multi-frequency \nsignal reception. \nThe CYGNSS satellites are placed in a lower altitude orbit \nthan UK-DMC and TechDemoSat-1 \(500 km instead of 680 \nkm coverage on the Earth's surface is achieved by using \ntwo nadir pointing antennas on two separate angled facets \non the CYGNSS satellites. Nominally, the same antenna \ndesign is used as on UK-DMC \(just under 12 


dBiC combined \nantenna pattern is broad enough that it is calculated that on \naverage four or more specular retlections will be visible \nwithin the antenna beam wi dth simultaneously. \nConsequently, the SGR-ReSI must be able to track and \nprocess retlections from at least four GPS retlections. \nOne GPS L1 front-end is allocated to each antenna, so three \nfront-ends are to be supported. Each antenna has an \nassociated low noise amplifier \(LNA little noise as possible. These L1 LNAs \nalso carry a switched load for calibration purposes. \nCYGNSS plans to use the SGR-ReSI primarily in an \nautonomous manner generating DDMs at a low data rate \ncontinuously, and this will provide a source of \nmeasurements for the ocean roughness across the oceans. \nWhen a particular location of interest is identified, for \nexample as a CYGNSS satellite passes over a developing \nstorm, the SGR-ReSI may be operated in raw data mode, \nwhere 60 seconds of raw sampled data is accumulated. This \nallows the scientists to fully analyze and re-analyze the \nacquired data using different processing schemes to ensure nthat the nominal DDM mode of operation is not losing \nimportant geophysical data. Hundreds of Megabytes of data \nwill be generated in this situation, however, which could \ntake a long time to download from such a small satellite \nplatform. An intermediate lower data alternative is to \ngenerate DDMs with a higher resolution and lower \nintegration time. If alternative processing schemes are \nidentified, the SGR-ReSI has the ability to accept new \nVirtex-4 processing images to be stored in its non-volatile \nFlash memory n978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©20131EEE \n5 \n7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE \nThis paper has introduced the SGR-ReSI and its capabilities \nin GPS Retlectometry. TechDemoSat-1 will offer the first \ndemonstration of this instrument and many of its \napplications, and will be a valuable pre-cursor and \nvalidation of the concept in the preparation for the CYGNSS \nmission. \nAs the CYGNSS constellation is optimized for the cyclone ngermination zones near the equator, it has a coverage that is \nlimited globally by the selected inclination of 35°. A future \nmission that covers the higher inclinations is likely to make \na valuable contribution towards weather knowledge at \nhigher latitudes. The coverage achieved is also limited by \nthe number of satellite retlections used within the SGR­\nReS!. Future work is being planned to upgrade the DDM \nprocessing to make use of more of the available GNSS \nsignal retlections, such as from Glonass, Galileo and \nCompass This change would reduce the number of sensing \nsatellites required to achieve an effective coverage of the nglobe and would also increase the cost effectiveness of \nGNSS Retlectometry as it moves towards becoming an noperational Earth Observation tool. \nRELATED PAPERS \nThis paper is part of a coordinated series of papers being \npresented at the 2013 IEEE Aerospace Conference in Big \nSky, MT.

that \nneed to be adjusted in place, such as the tensioner for a \nchain or belt.  In the case of RASSOR, these problems were \nmitigated after final assembly of the robot, but in the future, \nincluding them in the model would provide better results. \nTesting \nWith a complex design, the testing phase will typically \nreveal the most areas in need of improvement. This was \ncertainly the case with RASSOR. \nThe first subsystem that required many adjustments were \nthe tracks. It turned out to be very challenging to design a \ntrack drive system that could work in a variety of soils \nanalogous to lunar regolith.  Initial tests in sand exposed the nclogging problem, where regolith particles accumulated \nbetween the wheels and the tracks, causing the track to lose \ntooth engagement and slip off the wheel. This was remedied \nby redesigning open wheels that allowed the dirt to flow out \ntowards the hub as the wheels turned.  This solved the \nclogging issue for most types of soft and hard soil, except \nfor those like the crawlerway fines with larger size rocks \nthat could still get wedged in the wheel \(fig 10 the arm crossbar and locked \nup the drive system. \nAnother improvement was to exchange an all-rubber belt nmaterial with one that encompassed stainless steel wire \nropes running continuously through it.  This corrected a belt \nstretch issue that had been contributing to the belt coming \noff the wheels when clogged That issue was exaggerated at \nelevated temperatures due to the rubber softening. It should \nbe pointed out the on the moon the opposite issue would \noccur where the rubber would lose its flexibility. However, \nrubber would not be used on the moon; but as a terrestrial \nanalog it was acceptable in this prototype. The experience \nfrom testing with tracks has indicated that the next \ngeneration RASSOR prototype should use wheels instead of \ntracks to simplify operations and avoid the regolith induced \nproblems. The trade-off of tracks versus wheels corresponds \ndirectly to traction needs and if RASSOR can drive out of a \n20 degree incline trench ramp with wheels, then this could \nbe the preferred solution due to the lower mass and higher nreliability of a wheeled system. Future work will address \nthis design detail. \nInitial testing of the arms revealed that the chain connecting \ntwo gearboxes in series worked as designed in one direction, \nbut skipped teeth under load in the other direction.  This was \ndue to the entrance angle of the chain onto the drive nsprocket not being equal in both directions.  The issue was \nsolved by tightening the chain, which had to be done \nrepeatedly, as the chain stretches.  With this improvement in \nplace, the next issue that occurred was too much friction \nbetween gears on a custom gearbox housing using off-the-\nshelf gears. The root of this problem was a misalignment \nbetween the gears caused by tolerance stacking among the \nmultiple parts comprising the gearbox housing. \nA general improvement to be made during the testing phase \nis to test subsystems that appear multiple times on a single \nunit prior to integration. This will allow adjustments to be \nmade to the single assembly rather than all copies at once. \nThis was most apparent on the arm mechanism which \nutilized four identical gear trains that underwent several \niterations. The speed at which iterations were made would \n U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright 9 \nhave increased if updates had been made to a single unit \nonly. \nA set of encoders was linked to the output of the motor \nthrough a set of spur gears. The backlash of the spur gears \ncoupled with some wobble in the associated ball bearings \nwas enough to confuse the motor controllers and cause the \nmotors to stop intermittently. The last set of encoders was nattached directly to the output shaft of the motor, which was \noptimal.  However, even this setup needed one improvement \nprimarily because of the way the encoder wheel was \ndesigned.  The plastic encoder wheel was intended to simply \npress-fit onto a shaft, which in RASSORs case was smooth \nand had high accelerations and decelerations.  This resulted \nin the encoder coming loose. Knurling the surface of the \nshaft and using an adhesive solved this negative.  It is highly \nrecommended to use encoders with positive locking encoder nwheels directly on the motor output to avoid this issue. \nThe remaining lessons learned do not suggest hardware \nchanges, but rather refinements and proper implementation \nof the operations concept. The original concept of the \ncounter-rotating bucket drums was to make shallow skim \ncuts off the soil surface and drive while digging to fill up the \nscoops. In practice, this turned out to be difficult due to the \npurely manual control that required constant driver input. If \nthere was any initial unevenness in the soil surface, those nbumps would make the rover move off level as it drove \nforward, which meant one drum would be raised off the nground while the other would be driven deeper into the soil. \nThis created more unevenness for the next time the rover \nwould make another pass. Another unintended side effect of \nthe deep cut is that under some soil conditions the scoops \ncould get clogged with compacted regolith, and therefore \nbecome ineffective \(fig. 11 On the moon, low gravity, \nelectrostatic forces, Van der Waal forces, and high friction \nforces between the particles could create a similar situation \nwhereby cohesion of the granular material is increased, \ncausing similar bridging and clogging. This will be \naddressed in future designs by opening the size of the scoop nopening to prevent bridging or by vibrating the drum to free \nthe particles. \n \nFigure 11  Scoop clogged 


with damp sand. \nThe digging depth problems could be mitigated by \nautomating \(with scripting operations so that \nthe driver would not need to try to adjust the arms \nconstantly to keep them level even as the rover chassis \nbounced.  Driving very slowly while digging would allow \nthe arms to keep up with the moving chassis in order to take \neven, shallow cuts. The same scripting approach should be \ntaken for the acrobatics moves in order to smooth out the \nloads during those maneuvers. \nLastly, testing in icy regolith required some changes in the \ndigging approach. It seems to be more effective to first \nbreak up the hard, icy soil and then scoop up what has been \nbroken loose. A faster drum rotation will help the breaking \nup step while the slower drum rotation will then be used to \npick up the soil. Improvements in the cutting edge of each \nscoop, such as serrations or sharp pick ahead of the cutting \nedge will also help the rover perform better while digging \nicy regolith. \n8. SUMMARY  \nA novel, compact and lightweight excavation robot \nprototype for manipulating, excavating, acquiring, hauling \nand dumping regolith on extra-terrestrial surfaces has been ndeveloped and tested at the NASA, Kennedy Space Center.  \nLessons learned and test results have been presented in this \npaper, including results from digging in a variety of lunar \nregolith simulant conditions as well as frozen regolith mixed \nwith water ice.  \nThis prototyping effort has shown promising results and nproven the concept of using counter rotating bucket drums \nas an effective method of manipulating regolith in a load, \nhaul and dump scenario, to produce a micro-excavator \nsystem that can be delivered to the moon and other extra-\nterrestrial bodies on small robotic landers.  This method \nsuccessfully mitigates the problem of only having low \ndigging reaction forces available in low gravity \nenvironments, which is a major challenge when using \ntraditional excavation methods, such as those used on Earth. \nThe lessons learned have been valuable and the testing has \nalso revealed opportunities for improving the design and \noperations.  A second generation RASSOR will be \ndesigned, fabricated and tested to take advantage of these \nopportunities Eventually, it is hoped that a swarm of \nRASSORs will operate on the moon and other extra-\nterrestrial bodies to enable regolith mining for space \nresource utilization. \nREFERENCES  \n[1] Metzger, P.T., Muscatello, A Mueller, R.P., and \nMantovani, J.  Affordable, rapid bootstrapping of space \nindustry and solar system civilization, \(2012 Aerospace Engineering. \n \n U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright 10 \n[2] Schmitt, Jack.

CONCLUSION \n \nIn this paper, we suggested a network aware Hadoop \nperformance model and explored its scalability with the model. \nOur experimental results showed that the model could predict a \njobs execution with 5 % average error compared to the real \njob measurement within up to 4 rack 160 server clusters in nresolution of second. We could explain the cause of the real job \nmeasurement pattern under various conditions with the model. \nIn addition, with the model, we explored the Hadoop \nscalability characteristic in large clusters under various inter-\nswitch bandwidths and a numbers of reduces which are \nimportant for the scalability. By using the result, we showed \nHadoop scales out well in the typical cluster network nconfigurations, and suggested guidelines for application design \nand Hadoop scalability improvement. \n A 160 server cluster is a sufficiently large cluster for most \nof newly joined users to big data analysis without sufficient \nbudget for cluster and experience. Our model contributes the \nusers to save cost by assisting to analyzing potential of their \ncluster before adding a new server.  \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] J. Dean and S.

desired\nlevel of accuracy by simply increasing the number of steps.\nIn particular, any of Messacs canonical satisfaction function\ncan be modeled [31].\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can enter\none-of-a-kind requirement satisfaction rules. However, a\nspreadsheet-based user interface was implemented for rapid\ncoding of multi-step satisfaction functions, which have all the\nsame structure.\nStep 3a Aggregate Requirement SatisfactionThe prefer-\nence domain is hyperdimensional because there is at least one\ndimension per requirement, and in a complex system there\ncan easily be several hundreds or even thousands of require-\nments. Dominated architectures could easily be eliminated\nby means of Pareto analysis, but this is unlikely to reduce\nthe size of the tradespace by much due to the large number\nof requirements. Hence, the problem remains of choosing\nbetween architectures that have very different requirement\n10\nFigure 10. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3a: Aggregate satisfaction\nsatisfaction sets, but seem globally equally attractive. In prac-\ntice, the dimensionality of this domain needs to be reduced in\norder to be able to make a decision concerning the preferred\narchitectures. This requires the use of subjective information\ncapturing stakeholder preferences.\nHence, the last step of the methodology is the reduction of the\ndimensionality of the preference domain through aggregation\nof requirement \(i.e., subobjective then into stakeholder satisfaction. This two-\nstep aggregation process requires the elicitation of a list of\nobjectives and subobjectives from different stakeholders, and\nreduces the dimensionality of the preference domain \(i.e., the\nnumber of metrics Nsh\nto 1 if the relative importance of stakeholders to a central\nstakeholder is introduced. The relative importance of stake-\nholders can be formally computed by applying quantitative\nstakeholder analysis techniques e.g. stakeholder networks\n[32 represents the value of the system\narchitecture to the central stakeholder. The entire process is\nillustrated in Figure 10.\nMathematically, requirement aggregation rules reduce the\ndimensionality of the satisfaction space by using aggregation\nfunctions. Aggregation functions combine arithmetic and\nlogical operators. The simplest and most commonly used\narithmetic operator is the weighted average. For example, the\nsatisfaction of a stakeholder is given by a weighted average\nof the satisfaction of its objectives. More sophisticated arith-\nmetic operators are also possible \(see for example Yagers\nordered weighted averaging operator or Fortins gradual num-\nbers [33], [34 type, such as the at-least-n-out-of-\nk condition: the stakeholder is satisfied if 3 or more of these\n4 objectives are satisfied.\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can man-\nually define one-of-a-kind aggregation functions. Weighted\naverages can be rapidly coded in from a spreadsheet-based\nuser interface.\nStep 3b: Prepare ExplanationsThe VASSAR methodology\nprovides a set of explanations that accompany the fuzzy value\nmetric. This is central to the methodology, as it satisfies one\nof its key requirements, namely that of showing traceability\nof the value delivery loop. Explanation rules keep track of\nTable 3.

CASE STUDY\nWe selected a hypothetical soil moisture remote sensing\nsatellite mission as the case study to show the applicability\nthe VASSAR methodology. This hypothetical mission would\ncombine instruments that are similar to real instruments flown\nor to be flown in NASA and ESA missions References to\nthese missions will be made as required. This example was\ndesigned to illustrate different features of the methodology:\n\(1 elements of subjectivity, which are hard to\nmodel in traditional design tools;\n\(2 emergent behavior that actu-\nally drives an important part of the value delivery;\n\(3 of complexity, as it is complex\nenough to yield non-trivial results, but simple enough to avoid\nthe need to provide excessive background.\nPayload description\nFor this example we consider five candidate instruments:\na an L-band polarimetric radiometer \(LRADIO synthetic\naperture radar \(LSAR XRADIO IR P-band polarimetric\nSAR \(PSAR mass, power data rate, performance tradespace\nFor this example, we chose to represent an architecture as\nthe set of decisions laid out in Table 


3. The set of possible\narchitectures is given by the Cartesian product of the ranges\nof values in Table 3 which consists of 3,636 architectures.\n11\nFigure 11. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3b: Prepare explanations\nStakeholder requirements\nFive stakeholder groups or panels were identified for this\nexample, labeled as follows: weather climate, ecosystems,\nwater, and applications. All five panels were initially con-\nsidered equally important; a case with non-uniform weights\nis considered later in the sensitivity analysis. Note that the\npanels relative weights could be obtained through a formal\nmethod such as the one proposed by Cameron et al [32].\nThe specific objectives of each panel, as well as their relative\nranking, are provided in Appendix B.\nCapability rules\nNominal instrument capabilities are presented in Appendix\nA. However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters. Below are\na few examples of situations in which data quality is severely\ncompromised due to orbital parameters.\nLighting conditionsVisible and NIR instruments \(namely\nthe corresponding channels of the IR radiometer node because they cannot gather\nenough light.\nImage distortionSide-looking instruments cannot work at\nlow altitudes because image distortion becomes unaccept-\nable.\nEmergence rules\nEmergent behavior plays a key role in value delivery to\nstakeholders. We describe in this subsection a few examples\nof emergent behavior \(both in science and cost spatial\nresolution soil moisture dataset provided by LRADIO can be\ncombined with the lower accuracy, higher spatial resolution\ndataset provided by LSAR to produce a new high accuracy,\nmedium spatial resolution dataset.\nSample averagingIn any dataset, part of the non-systematic\nerror can be reduced by averaging samples in time or space,\nthus effectively creating a new dataset that trades accuracy\nagainst spatial or temporal resolution.\nLevel-4 data productsA level-4 net carbon ecosystem ex-\nchange dataset can be created from the combination of a\nlevel-3 soil moisture dataset and several ancillary products,\nnamely land surface temperature, vegetation state, and land-\ncover status.\nMultispectral measurementsIR and MW snow and ice cover\ndatasets can be combined to produce new, multispectral, more\naccurate datasets.\nSharing a common dishThe L-band radar and radiometer\ncan share a common antenna thus effectively reducing the\ntotal mass of the system.\nLearning CurveIf several identical satellites are developed\nand fabricated, the marginal cost of the second and subse-\nquent units is lower than the cost of the first unit due to\nlearning.\nResults\nThe set of 3,636 architectures was evaluated using VASSAR.\nThe benefit portion is based on the set of requirements from\nAppendix B. The cost portion is based on the cost model de-\nscribed in Appendix C. The point science scores and lifecycle\ncost estimates for all these architectures are shown on Figure\n12. These numbers are obtained from defuzzyfying the fuzzy\n12\nFigure 12. Expected science vs expected lifecycle cost for\n3,636 architectures \(uniform weights analysisThe main goal of any system architect-\ning tool is to gain insight into the shape of the tradespace,\nwhat the main trades are, whether there are families of\narchitectures, and so on. We observe several features just by\nlooking at the tradespace in Figure 12:\n\(1 a science score\nof 0. This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate. An example of the latter is when a side-\nlooking instrument is put at 400km, resulting in a too large\nimage distortion.\n\(2 unresolvable conflicting require-\nments. In this particular case, most of the observations\nrequire a SSO in order to get rid of diurnal variations in radi-\nance. However, a small subset of requirements that concern\noceanography or cryospheric measurements are ideally taken\nin true polar, non-SSO orbits, in order to avoid tidal aliasing\n\(oceanography cryosphere it is impossible to be in a polar\nand SSO orbit simultaneously, some value is going to be lost\nno matter what decision is made.\n\(3 costs. This is a typical behavior in\narchitectural tradespaces, that has its origins in the non-linear\nmapping between capabilities and satisfaction, namely in the\nquantization of satisfaction levels. In other words slightly\ndifferent performances may be perceived as equivalent in\nterms of satisfaction by stakeholders.\nExplanation facilityThe explanation facility provides sup-\nport for more advanced analysis of the tradespace. Examples\nof the features of the explanation facility are listed below:\n\(1 The explanation facility provides\ndetailed explanations of the scores of an architecture in text\nformat as required by the user. An example of such informa-\ntion is provided in Table 4.\n\(2 support: The explanation facility\ncan provide information about one or more architectures on\nFigure 13 


Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy resultsWe emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., Most or Some larger.\nSensitivity AnalysisThere are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis. The red line shows the\ncorrespondence between scalar mass and scalar cost through\na parametric relationship embedded in the tool.\n3 merit change\nwhen each variable is changed. Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17.

Local search around architecture #669, high-\nlighted on Table 5\n4 CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a methodology to assess the value\nof a system architecture using RBES Such methodology can\nbe used in the context of automatic architectural tradespace\nexploration to develop the part of computational tools that\nautomatically evaluates the architectures being generated. An\nexample of such tool was shown in the context of Earth Ob-\nserving Satellite Systems \(EOSS is\ndivided in two parts. First, the advantages and disadvantages\nof VASSAR with respect to the state-of-the-art of system\narchitecting tools is discussed. Second, the next steps in this\nresearch project are outlined.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of VASSAR\nThe following are advantages  the\nVASSAR methodology with respect to other frameworks:\n\(1  delivery\nloop. All requirements are directly traceable to stakeholder\nneeds. All capabilities are directly traceable to architectural\ndecisions.\n\(2  e.g., sci-\nence and engineering back-\ngrounds, simply because it is the way in which the human\nmind works.\n\(3  the domain-specific\nknowledge from the domain-independent knowledge, which\ntranslates into increased scalability and reusability, and facil-\nitates task allocation between system architects and software\nengineers.\n\(4  lessons learned: it serves as\na repository of knowledge to conserve expertise, and it also\nuses the lessons learned in the form of logical rules to evaluate\nsystem architectures.\n\(5  delivery loop facilitates more\n16\noptimal task allocation between man \(the system architect the computational tool architectures and through the use of the text-\nbased and graphics-based explanation facility. The system\narchitect feeds the tool with knowledge, guides the tradespace\nexploration process, and makes all non-objective decisions.\n\(6  of recursive algorithms, which\nare at the core of modeling emergence, which in turn is the\norigin of value.\n\(7  8  a computational price, which is only\nworth it if the knowledge base is likely to evolve.\n\(9  slow when the number of rules is very\nlarge.\n\(10  the expert knowledge \(e.g. lessons learned specific\npurpose: evaluating system architectures in the context of\nautomatic architectural tradespace exploration. Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSARs\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
