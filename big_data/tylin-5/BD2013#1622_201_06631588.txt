We considered data\nrates of 0.1 Mbps and 1 Mbps. For the simulations, we\nused SUMO and NS3. We considered IEEE 802.11p standard\nand TwoRayGroundPropagationLossModel. We use through-\nput and cwnd as evaluation metrics. The simulation results\nshow that for small data rates, routing has a big effect on the\nperformance of the network and AODV has better link stability\nand performance compared with OLSR. For big data rates,\nboth protocols have almost the same performance. Because of\ncongestion, node stack overflow and the routing have a small\neffect.\nKeywords-VANETs, Routing Protocol, OLSR, AODV, TCP.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nVehicular Ad-hoc Networks VANETs Intelligent Transportation Sys-\ntems \(ITS potential accidents and make new forms of inter-\nvehicle communications.\nDue to the high cost of deploying and implementing\nVANET systems in a real environment, most of research\nis concentrated on simulations.\nIn the recent years, a lot of simulators for VANETs\nhave been emerging [1]. For example, the IMPORTANT\nframework has been one of the first attempt to understand\nthe dependence between vehicular traffic and communication\nperformance [2], [3]. The authors analyzed the impact of the\nnode mobility on the duration of communication paths.\nIn [4], the authors present a simulator written in Java,\nwhich can generate mobility traces in several formats. There\nare also other powerful traffic simulators, like TranSim [5],\nwhich makes use of a cellular automaton for simulating the\ninteraction of vehicles. Cellular Automaton based VEhicular\nNETwork CAVENET  of vehicular traffic and their impact on the perfor-\nmance of VANETs.\nAlso, SUMO is another powerful traffic simulator, in-\ntended for traffic planning and road design optimization.\nThere is an attempt to interface SUMO with NS2 [6].\nSince VANETs are a specific class of ad-hoc networks,\nthe commonly used ad-hoc routing protocols initially im-\nplemented for MANETs have been tested and evaluated\nfor VANET environments. VANETs share some common\ncharacteristics with MANETs. They are both characterized\nby the movement and self organization of the nodes. We con-\nsider the possibility of using ad-hoc and MANET protocols\nfor VANET scenarios.\nIn our previous work [11], we evaluated the perfor-\n2013 Fourth International Conference on  Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies\n978-0-7695-5044-2/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/EIDWT.2013.142\n33\nmance of three routing protocols: Ad-hoc On-demand Dis-\ntance Vector \(AODV  OLSR  Dynamic MANET On Demand\n\(DYMO   model.\nIn this work, we use Simulation of Urban Mobility\n\(SUMO to\nevaluate the performance of OLSR and AODV routing pro-\ntocols in a Manhattan grid VANET scenario when sending\ntriple TCP flow.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section\nII, we describe TCP congestion control and TCP NewReno\ncongestion avoidance algorithm. In Section III, we briefly\ndescribe OLSR and AODV routing protocols. The simulation\nsystem design and description is presented in Section IV.\nIn Section V, we show the simulation results. Finally, the\nconclusions and future work are presented in Section VI.\nII. TCP CONGESTION CONTROL\nTCP is the basic transport layer protocol used to provide\na reliable end-to-end data transmission. It uses several algo-\nrithms for congestion control. The goal of TCP congestion\ncontrol avoidance algorithms is to increase the congestion\nwindow size if there is additional bandwidth available on\nthe network, and decrease the congestion window size when\nthere is congestion.\nA. TCP NewReno\nTCP NewReno is a modification of TCP Reno. Its im-\nplementation overcomes the drawback of TCP Reno by\nmodifying the Fast Recovery algorithm to eliminate TCP\nReno‘s wait for a retransmit timer when multiple packets\nare lost from one window of data [9]. TCP NewReno\nimplements some modifications in Fast Recovery algorithm,\nin order to improve the response to partial acknowledgments,\nwhich were first proposed by Janey Hoe [10].\nIn TCP Newreno, when a sender receives a partial ac-\nknowledgement, it does not come out of Fast Recovery\nphase but it retransmits the lost packet and continues to\nbe in this phase. Thus, in a multiple packet loss scenario\nNewReno does not reduce cwnd multiple times by entering\nand exiting Fast Recovery phase multiple times. It stays in\nFast 


Recovery phase until all the packets of the same window\nare acknowledged. In this way TCP NewReno avoids many\nof the retransmit timeouts when multiple packets are lost\nfrom one window of data. However, it can retransmit one\nlost packet per RTT when the connection is in Fast Recovery\nphase. NewReno enters into fast-retransmit when it receives\nmultiple duplicate packets.\nIII. ROUTING PROTOCOLS\nFor our performance comparison study, we choose two\nad hoc routing protocols OLSR and AODV. We will briefly\ndescribe these protocols in following.\nA. OLSR Protocol\nThe OLSR protocol [13] is a pro-active routing protocol,\nwhich builds up a route for data transmission by maintaining\na routing table inside every node of the network. The\nrouting table is computed upon the knowledge of topology\ninformation, which is exchanged by means of Topology\nControl TC through their\nresponses. The sender can then select its Multi Point Relays\n\(MPR which offer the best\nroutes to the two hop nodes. By this way, the amount of\ncontrol traffic can be reduced Each node has also an MPR\nselector set which enumerates nodes that have selected it as\nan MPR node. OLSR uses TC messages along with MPR\nforwarding to disseminate neighbour information throughout\nthe network. Host Network Address \(HNA messages advertise host routes.\nB. AODV Protocol\nThe AODV is an improvement of DSDV [19] to on-\ndemand scheme It minimize the broadcast packet by creat-\ning route only when needed. Every node in network main-\ntains the route information table and participate in routing\ntable exchange. When source node wants to send data to the\ndestination node, it first initiates route discovery process. In\nthis process, source node broadcasts Route Request \(RREQ neighbour nodes. This\nprocess continues until RREQ reach to the destination or\nthe node who know the path to destination.\nWhen the intermediate nodes receive RREQ, they record\nin their tables the address of neighbours thereby establishing\na reverse path. When the node which knows the path to\ndestination or destination node itself receives RREQ, it sends\nback Route Reply \(RREP by using reverse path. When the source\nnode receives RREP packet, it can know the path to desti-\nnation node and it stores the discovered path information in\nits route table. This is the end of route discovery process.\nThen, AODV performs route maintenance process. In route\nmaintenance process, each node periodically transmits a\nHello message to detect link breakage.\nIV. SIMULATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION\nWe use SUMO 21] to generate the mobility patterns of\nvehicles and NS3 to simulate the vehicle ad hoc network\nenvironment The detailed simulation model is based on NS-\n3 \(ver-3.14.1  and\ndistributed completely in the C++ programming language,\nbecause it better facilitated the inclusion of C-based imple-\nmentation code.

The\ngoals of NS3 are set very high: to create a new network\nsimulator aligned with modern research needs and develop\nit in an open source community Users of NS3 are free to\nwrite their simulation scripts as either C++ main NS3s low-level API is oriented\ntowards the power-user but more accessible “helper” APIs\nare overlaid on top of the low-level API.\nIn order to achieve scalability of a very large number of\nsimulated network elements, the NS3 simulation tools also\nsupport distributed simulation. The NS3 support standard-\nized output formats for trace data, such as the pcap format\nused by network packet analyzing, tools such as tcpdump,\nand a standardized input format such as importing mobility\ntrace files from NS2 [20].\nThe NS3 simulator has models for all network elements\nthat comprise a computer network. For example, network\ndevices represent the physical device that connects a node to\nthe communication channel. This might be a simple Ethernet\nnetwork interface card, or a more complex wireless IEEE\n802.11 device.\nIn our simulations we used IEEE 802.11p standard and\nTwoRayGroundPropagationLossModel.\nIEEE 802.11p: It is an approved amendment to the IEEE\n802.11 standard to add wireless access in vehicular environ-\nments \(WAVE ITS applications.

CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we evaluated the performance of OLSR\nand AODV routing protocols in a Manhattan grid scenario\nwhen sending triple TCP flow. We considered data rates\nof 0.1 Mbps and 1 Mbps and

The noperator creates one HTML page for every single fragment and \nbuilds an index page linking all of the other pages. In this case, \nno output datacube is created in the Ophidia data store. The \ninput string for this operator is even simpler than the \nOPH_APPLY one: \n \n operator=oph_publish;datacube_input=cube_in \n \nFinally OPH_CUBE_ELEMENTS computes in parallel \nthe total number of elements stored in a datacube without \ncounting NotANumber values, which are common in sparse \ndatacubes. The input string is similar to the OPH_PUBLISH: \n \n operator=oph_cube_elements;datacube_input=cube_in \n \nNote that the inputs strings reported before contain the nmandatory arguments only. In some cases additional non-\nmandatory arguments are also available \(e.g., the scheduling \npolicy for the distribution task noph_setup_env and oph_cleanup_env interfaces.

In the second case \(oph_cleanup_env de-allocate the memory structures previously \nallocated. \nSimilarly, in the three operators, oph_destroy is an empty \nfunction and oph_distribution distributes the fragments among \nthe parallel processes, applying a simple and intuitive \ndistribution algorithm based on the process identifier. \n \nFig. 3. The OPH_APPLY internal diagram. The schema shows how the 7 \nsteps of the analytics framework are mapped onto the implementation of the \nOPH_APPLY operator. \nThe principal differences among the three operators are:  \n OPH_CUBE_ELEMENTS implements the \noph_reduce interface to perform a reduction task and \nsum the total number of elements from the partial \nresults computed by all the processes. The reduction \ntask is not needed by the other two operators; \n5\n• OPH_APPLY and OPH_PUBLISH implement the \noph_init interface to create, respectively the \ndatacube_out entry in the OphidiaDB and the web \ndirectory containing the HTML pages. The nOPH_CUBE_ELEMENT does not need the \nimplementation of this interface since the result is \nmanaged in memory and delivered to the end user as a \nmetadata output information; \n \n \nFig. 4.

Operators benchmark: preliminary insights \nA comprehensive evaluation of the Ophidia analytics \nframework is out of the scope of this paper and will be \npresented in future work. However, a preliminary performance n6\nevaluation provides some interesting insights about both the \nanalytics framework and the current implementation of some \nkey operators. The benchmark environment consists of a \ncluster equipped with 12 dual processor nodes IBM iDataplex \n\(2 Intel Sandy Bridge processors, 2x8 cores, 64GB RAM, \n500GB local disk, 20MB chipset cache remaining eight nodes host 4 MySQL servers \neach, which are used for I/O purposes.

n• use case A “compute intensive”: OPH_APPLY applies \na reduce_all_max array-based primitive on a 500GB ndatacube. The datacube is partitioned in 64 fragments \nwith 10^4 tuples \(each tuple stores a 10^5-element narray the \nmaximum element of the array nreduce_all_max primitive. The operator generates an \noutput datacube of about 14MB in size. The runs \ninvolve from 1 to 64 parallel processes. \n• use case B “I/O intensive”: OPH_PUBLISH runs on a \n2.5GB datacube. The datacube is partitioned into 64 \nfragments consisting of 500 tuples each one. Each \ntuple stores a 10^4-element array. The full datacube is \npublished on a 5GB set of HTML pages \(the HTML \ntags and the different way the data is stored – ASCII \ncharacters in HTML files instead of binary data in a \ndatabase table double the datacube size same fragmentation and \ndistribution settings at the node level. More specifically: \n \n§ = 4 \(number of DBMSInstances/IOnode number of databases/DBMSInstance number of fragments/database define the absolute fragmentation index Fi = §*ß*? as \nthe total number of fragments per I/O node, which is equal to 8 \nin both use cases. We plan in future work to study how \nchanging Fi impacts performance: this topic is out of the scope \nof this paper for page limit issues. \nTable II shows the execution time and the efficiency for the \nfirst use case. Efficiency is always more than 95%. As an \nadditional test, doubling the datacube input \(1TB 24 in total 94% on 128 cores. \nTable III presents the results for the second use case. In this \ncase the efficiency is always more than 92%, even though the \ngenerated output is quite different in size \(366 times bigger \nthan in the previous use case cases are quite different in terms of output \nsize and processing needs, they behave in a similar manner and nscale linearly. This is due to several factors: \n• the distributive nature of the two use cases, which \nhelps in having a large number of sub-tasks working in \nparallel without strong communication needs or issues;  \n the low number of fragments does not introduce a high \noverhead both in the distribution and execution tasks n• the analytics framework design which guides the \noperators implementation through seven well defined ninterfaces \(see Section III.B nTable IV shows the different behaviour of the two operators \nin terms of I/O. We see that the aggregate throughput of the I/O \nnodes is small in the OPH_APPLY use case \(less than \n1MB/sec intensive nature of the use case \nand the small output generated. Conversely, aggregate I/O is \nmuch higher in the OPH_PUBLISH use case \(due to the \nmassive I/O to generate the HTML output the number of cores \(up to 100MB/sec with 64 \nparallel processes, see Fig. 7 OHP_APPLY sec 824.01 1.00 \n4 412.40 1.00 \n8 206.21 1.00 \n16 103.44 1.00 \n32 52.43 0.98 \n64 27.18 0.95 \nTABLE III.

In future work, we will also evaluate \nperformance when using a different cluster configuration \nnamed super-node, in which all cluster nodes participate in \nboth I/O and compute tasks. \nThus, each node will be used to run the operators as well as \nto host the I/O servers.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nThe Ophidia analytics framework, a core part of the \nOphidia research project, has been presented. As discussed in \nthis work, the analytics framework is responsible for \natomically processing, transforming and manipulating array-\nbased data, by providing a common way to run on large \nclusters analytics tasks applied to big datasets. The paper has \nhighlighted the design principles, the algorithm and the most \nrelevant implementation aspects associated to the Ophidia nanalytics framework. Besides a comprehensive list of the most \nrelevant operators, three of them have been also presented in \ndetail \(OPH_APPLY and OPH_PUBLISH for the data part, \nOPH_CUBE_ELEMENTS for the metadata part OPH_APPLY and OPH_PUBLISH 


nparallel operators to support new scientific use cases. Array-\nbased primitives extensions, a data analytics query language \nand an optimized query planner will be considered to support \nmore complex operators and dataflow driven requests. A \ncomprehensive analytics benchmark will be also defined and \nimplemented to further evaluate the performance of the system. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis work was supported in part by the Italian Ministry of \nEducation, Universities and Research \(MIUR U.S. Department of Energy, \nOffice of Science through grant DE-AC02-06CH11357. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] S.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
