The multidimensionality, volume, \ncomplexity, and variety of scientific data need specific \nsolutions able to \(i datasets [5,6], \(ii iii through parallel \nsolutions able to deliver results in \(near  libraries and frameworks used in \nmany scientific domains are mostly sequential today. This \nbarrier strongly limits scientific productivity, slowing down or \nentirely preventing data analysis activities on large datasets.  \nIn the climate science context few tools exploit parallel \nparadigms for analysis and visualization [8,11], making urgent \nthe need for new \(big projects in this area like ParCAT [12], ParNCL, and \nParGAS [13], share this scientific goal, but provide a toolkit \nrather than a framework.  \nScientific data needs data warehouse-like [14,15] platforms \nto perform data analytics. However, current general-purpose \n\(enterprise-based OLAP nsystems are not suitable for eScience due to their limited \nscalability, a lack of support for parallel solutions and for the \nanalysis of large volumes of data, and their inadequate support \nfor numerical and mathematical libraries. Additionally, specific \narray-based support \(which is key for n-dimensional scientific ndata and use cases.  \nThe Ophidia project is addressing most of these challenges, \nin the context of a research effort addressing big data analytics \nissues for eScience. The key test case for Ophidia concerns the nanalysis of global climate simulations produced at the Euro-\nMediterranean Centre on Climate Change, in the context of the \ninternational Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 \n\(CMIP5  basis, climate scientists need to \nrun on large datasets data transformation, analysis, and \nprocessing tasks to reduce data, extract time series, compute \nensemble means, run scenarios, perform model inter-\ncomparisons infer statistical indicators, and perform re-\ngridding. Most of these tasks are today performed via batch \nand sequential command line interfaces and tools that cannot \nprovide needed answers efficiently or in real-time In contrast, \nthe Ophidia platform aims to provide an OLAP-like data \nmanagement solution providing \(through parallel “data \nkernels” running on HPC machines building block of the \nOphidia project is the analytics framework, which is also the \nkey topic of this paper nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section \nII describes the Ophidia architecture. Section III presents the \nOphidia analytics framework, discussing in detail the \nfunctional and non-functional requirements that have driven its \ndesign, the analytics framework algorithm and implementation, \nthe deployment diagram, a comprehensive set of operators, the \ninternals of three operators, and some experimental results on a \n12-node IBM iDataplex cluster. Finally, Section IV draws \nconclusions and highlights future work. \nII. THE OPHIDIA ARCHITECTURE \nAs depicted in Fig. 1, the Ophidia architecture consists of \nseveral layers: the storage system, the I/O nodes, the \nOphidiaDB, the compute nodes, and the Ophidia server.  \nThe storage system represents the hardware resource \nmanaging the data store of the Ophidia architecture. It consists \nof a set of disks storing datacubes.  \nThe storage system is accessed via the I/O nodes, which \nhost a set of I/O servers responsible for the parallel I/O with the \nunderlying storage system. As described elsewhere [18], the \ncurrent implementation of a single I/O server relies on the \nMySQL relational DBMS, which has been extended to support \narray-based data type and primitives. The datacubes in the \nMySQL databases are organized in a hierarchical structure and \nare partitioned in several tables \(called fragments nacross multiple databases and MySQL servers. The data in the \nfragments are multidimensional arrays stored according to the \nOphidia internal storage model, which exploits a key-value \napproach. A preliminary set of Ophidia array-based primitives, \nthe storage model, and the hierarchical data structure have been \ndescribed 


elsewhere [18] with some examples and use cases.  \n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n1978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE \nMetadata is stored in the OphidiaDB, a relational database nrunning on top of a MySQL server.  \nThe compute nodes are machines used by the Ophidia \ninfrastructure to run the data analytics framework, which is \nbased on a set of \(parallel and sequential most relevant data and metadata datacube primitives. Each \noperator running on the compute nodes triggers a set of array-\nbased primitives on the I/O nodes to analyze, transform and \nprocess a datacube as a whole. In more detail, the array based \nprimitives and datacube operators work at two different levels: \nwhile the former focus on n-dimensional arrays stored in a \nsingle relational table \(a single fragment focus on an \nentire datacube involving the complete set of associated \nfragments. Another important difference is that array-based \nprimitives run on the I/O nodes \(exploiting a software-based \nactive storage approach while datacube operators run on the \ncompute nodes. The currently available array-based primitives \nare sequential, while most datacube operators have a parallel \nimplementation. \n \n \nFig. 1. The Ophidia architecture \nFinally, the Ophidia server represents the front-end of the \nsystem. It is a web service implemented in gSOAP and \nexposing a standard WS-I interface. The server manages both \nthe user authentication and authorization. It also provides \ncomplete session management support to \(i ii iii caching \nand logging. The Ophidia server is strongly tied to the Ophidia \nanalytics framework. Indeed, it is responsible for submitting \nthe analytics operators \(through the analytics framework infrastructure, thus dispatching jobs and \nmanaging queues and priorities. \nIn the sections that follow, we describe the Ophidia \nanalytics framework and its operators. We will review its \ndesign, present a deployment diagram, classify and list \noperators, describe implementation details for some operators, \nand present some benchmark results. \nIII. THE OPHIDIA ANALYTICS FRAMEWORK \nAs stated before, the analytics framework in the Ophidia \nsystem is responsible for atomically processing and \nmanipulating datacubes, by providing a common way to run \ndistributive tasks on large set of fragments. The following \nsubsections present and discuss in detail several aspects of the \nOphidia design and the implementation.  \nA. Functional and non-functional requirements \nThe following major functional requirements drove the \ndesign of the Ophidia analytics framework: \n• plugin-based infrastructure: the analytics framework \nhas to provide a plugin-based infrastructure to make \nstraightforward the implementation, integration, \nmonitoring, and execution of new operators. To this \nend, we design a well-defined and general API with \nwhich each operator must comply, and implement a \nruntime analytics framework execution environment; \n• data and metadata operators: we must provide a wide \nset of core primitives to manipulate both the data \ncontained in datacubes \(e.g., sub-setting duplication, \ntransformation, export/import, array-based analysis, \ndata reduction associated with \ndatacubes \(e.g., list of datacubes, datacube size, \ndatacube number of elements, datacube provenance \ninformation domain-oriented and \ndomain-agnostic operators. Import and export of a \ndatacube into/from the Ophidia data store can represent \ntwo cases of domain-oriented operators \(e.g., \nimport/export of NetCDF [17] files to/from the \nOphidia data store in the climate change domain nframework should provide logging and bookkeeping \nfor every operator. Thus, we include these capabilities \nin the runtime analytics framework execution \nenvironment rather than in each operator module. \nIn addition, we also took into account the following major \nnon-functional requirements in the Ophidia analytics \nframework design: \n• dynamicity: adding new operators to the system must \nnot imply rebuilding the entire framework dynamic \napproach the implementation of \nwhatever task running on the Ophidia infrastructure in \nthe form of a framework operator; \n• robustness: the framework has to be able to properly \nreact to and cope with errors and exceptions during the \nexecution of any operator; \n• extensibility: the system must be easily extensible to nkeep rapidly evolving in terms of set of functionalities \nthrough the implementation of new operators Besides \nthe core/system operators available in the Ophidia \nmiddleware, the framework API has to be easy and nclear enough to facilitate the implementation of \noperators by the end-users. This will help making this neffort community based and incorporating new \nfunctionalities in the form of new operators; \n2\n paradigm-agnostic: the framework must not be tied to \na specific execution paradigm. It has to allow the nimplementation of sequential, parallel, and distributed \noperators. Thus, paradigm-specific instructions must nbe incorporated in operator implementations rather \nthan in the framework itself; \n• efficiency: the runtime analytics framework execution \nenvironment has to be lightweight and efficient \nwithout representing a bottleneck for the entire system. \nB. Analytics framework design \nStarting from the aforementioned 


requirements, the Ophidia \nanalytics framework has been designed and implemented as an \nalgorithm based on seven functions, plus a wide set of \noperators implemented as dynamic libraries. To address \nflexibility and deal with both complex and simple operators, \nthree functions have been defined as mandatory and four ones \nas non-mandatory. Each operator must implement the three \nmandatory functions and may choose to implement the other \nfour ones as well.  \nTo dynamically bind an operator at runtime, the analytics \nframework exploits the GNU Libtool libltdl library, which \nhides the complexity of using shared libraries behind a \nconsistent portable interface [19]. Such an approach makes the \nframework lightweight, simple, and manageable. The set of ninterfaces has been designed to guarantee strong code \nmodularity and separation of concerns. \nThe framework manages status and logging information; \nthus, operator implementations need not be concerned with \nthese issues. Conversely, the framework does not include any \nMPI, OpenMP, or distribute calls/APIs since the adopted \nparadigm \(sequential, parallel, or distributed software is being tested \ntoday on a single cluster configuration and most current \noperators are MPI-based in the future the same software could \nrun on a distributed set of clusters, by exploiting new operators nbased on distributed libraries and middleware. \nThe seven interfaces reflect the following general tasks nenvironment setup/clean-up, operator init/destroy, task \ndistribution/reduction and operator execution.  \nThe Ophidia analytics framework algorithm goes through \nall of these steps, as depicted in the following pseudo-code. In \nthis pseudo-code, the three mandatory calls are shown in \nboldface. \n \nint oph_analytics_framework_algorithm \(char* input_args char* input_args,  \n oph_operator_struct * handle oph_operator_struct * handle oph_operator_struct * handle oph_operator_struct * handle oph_operator_struct * handle oph_operator_struct * handle oph_operator_struct * handle nany logging, bookkeeping or error management \nsections/instructions. For a more complete understanding of the nanalytics framework algorithm, it is important to look at the \noph_operator_struct data structure \(used by all of the \nframework functions operator_handle; \n    int proc_number; \n    int proc_rank; \n    char *lib; \n    void *dlh; \n oph_operator_struct; \n \nIn addition to a few general and intuitive attributes \nregarding all operators, the oph_operator_struct always \nincludes a void* operator_handle pointer to an internal handle \ncontaining any additional attributes needed by the target \noperator. This feature makes the analytics framework interfaces nhighly flexible, allowing for each operator the definition and \nmanagement of an operator-specific set of attributes. \nAnother important property of the analytics framework \nalgorithm lies in its symmetry oph_init/oph_destroy, \noph_setup_env/oph_clean-up_env, distribution/reduction generic operator implementation, \nonly oph_setup_env, oph_cleanup_env and \noph_execute_operator are mandatory Thus, the \nimplementation of simple operators can be lightweight. \nDue to the framework generality, each interface/task \nobjective has been properly defined to better guide the user \nthrough the correct operator implementation process. In \nparticular: \n• oph_setup_env is a mandatory task responsible for \nsetting up the operator runtime environment \(e.g., \nallocating the operator-specific structure pointed by the noperator_handle pointer mandatory task releasing the memory or deactivating \nmodules initialised in the oph_setup_env; \n• oph_init is a non-mandatory task responsible for \nactivating a set of preliminary actions to be executed \nbefore the distribution task e.g., the creation of a new \ndatacube entry in the OphidiaDB finalises/closes those actions; \n• oph_distribution task is a non-mandatory task in \ncharge of distributing the load among the available \nworkers \(e.g., processes, threads, agents are implemented as part of this \ntask; on the other hand, the oph_reduction is the non-\nmandatory and complementary task in charge of \ngathering/reducing data and results from all the \nworkers. Reduction strategies and policies are \nimplemented as part of this task; \n• oph_execute_operator is a mandatory task responsible \nfor running the core operator function. It is the central \nand more intuitive task of the framework. It exploits all \n3\nthe memory structures, connections and information \ninitialised and distributed in the previous tasks. It is \nalso responsible for providing the main output of the \noperator. \n \nFig. 2. The deployment diagram of the Ophidia analytics framework \nC. Analytics framework implementation \nWe next review some important aspects of the \nimplementation. The analytics framework is based on the \npseudo-code presented in the previous section and is \nimplemented in C language. In more detail, the seven functions \nof the Ophidia API represent the static part of the analytics \nframework library. They basically deal with the libltdl, to nproperly manage the dynamic libraries binding associated to \neach operator. It is important to remark that 


they are not \ndirectly available to developers. Indeed, the analytics \nframework library supplies the developers with just the \nfollowing single algorithm function: \n \n int oph_analytics_framework_algorithm char* input_args top of the Ophidia software. This \ninterface has only one input parameter \(input_args semicolon-separated list of argument=value strings. It is \nmandatory to have an operator argument in the input_args \nstring so that the framework can properly identify the target \noperator and the associated dynamic library. \nThe deployment diagram reported in Fig. 2 shows that each \noperator exploits several libraries. Two of the most relevant \nones in the current release of the Ophidia analytics framework \n\(v1.0 Passing Interface \(MPI operators, whereas the latter has been exploited in \nthe data and metadata operators code to establish the nconnection with the I/O servers \(MySQL DBMSs SQL statements the \ndiagram highlights the adoption of several numerical libraries \nin the Ophidia framework \(e.g., GSL [20 and PETSc [21 nlibraries, new ones can be added to the system without doing \nany change to \(or rebuild This makes the \nentire software infrastructure \(both in terms of datacube \noperators and array-based functionalities the dynamicity non-functional requirements. \nEven though the primary goal of the framework is to \nsupport data operators for analysing and processing datacubes, \nthe framework is also extensively used to run metadata noperators—usually single process tasks accessing to the \nOphidiaDB to get metadata information and implementing only \nthe three mandatory framework interfaces. \nTABLE I.  THE OPHIDIA DATA AND METADATA OPERATORS \n  \nAs a general rule, all interactions with the Ophidia system \ncome in the form of operators. Yet some operators run system \n\(parallel and/or sequential data/metadata infrastructure at all. Some examples are \noperators that clean up directories on cluster nodes I/O or \ncompute illustrates the generality of the \ndesigned framework, which is able to go even beyond the \ndata/metadata analytics infrastructure needs. \nOPERATOR NAME OPERATOR DESCRIPTION \nOperators “Data processing Domain-agnostic\nOPH_APPLY\(datacube_in,  \ndatacube_out, \narray_based_primitive applying \nthe array-based primitive to the \ndatacube_in  \nOPH_DUPLICATE\(datacube_\nin, datacube_out copy of the datacube_in in \nthe datacube_out \nOPH_SUBSET\(datacube_in, \nsubset_string, datacube_out the datacube_out by doing a \nsub-setting of the datacube_in by \napplying the subset_string nOPH_MERGE\(datacube_in, \nmerge_param, datacube_out merge_param fragments \nfrom datacube_in  \nOPH_SPLIT\(datacube_in, \nsplit_param, datacube_out datacube_out by splitting \ninto groups of split_param fragments \neach fragment of the datacube_in nOPH_INTERCOMPARISON \n\(datacube_in1, datacube_in2, \ndatacube_out nelement-wise difference between \ndatacube_in1 and datacube_in2 \nOPH_DELETE\(datacube_in datacube_in \nOperators “Data processing” – Domain-oriented\nOPH_EXPORT_NC \n\(datacube_in, file_out datacube_in data into the \nfile_out NetCDF file. \nOPH_IMPORT_NC \n\(file_in, datacube_out stored into the file_in \nNetCDF file into the new datacube_in \ndatacube \nOperators “Data access nOPH_INSPECT_FRAG \n\(datacube_in, fragment_in datacube_in  \nOPH_PUBLISH\(datacube_in Metadata” \nOPH_CUBE_ELEMENTS \n\(datacube_in nOPH_CUBE_SIZE \n\(datacube_in void the list of available datacubes. \nOPH_CUBEIO\(datacube_in datacube_in \nOPH_FIND\(search_param current version of the Ophidia framework provides \nabout forty operators \(parallel and sequential parallel \nones are all concerned with data \(both domain-oriented and \ndomain-agnostic are all concerned \nwith either metadata or system. Table I lists, describes, and \nclassifies 16 of these operators. \nD. The internals of three relevant operators \nThis section presents in detail the OPH_APPLY \(Fig 3 Fig. 5 Fig. \n4 each \ncase, we discuss how the seven steps of the analytics \nframework are mapped onto the seven functions described \nbefore. We also review the main differences among the \noperators. OPH_APPLY \(data processing OPH_PUBLISH \n\(data access metadata \nmanagement implemented using the \nMessage Passing Interface \(MPI all \nfragments of an input datacube. The input string for this \noperator is quite simple and involves few 


arguments like in the \nfollowing example: \n \n operator=oph_apply;datacube_input=cube_in;datacube_output=\ncube_out;query=oph_reduce\(oph_subarray\(measure,1,12 0 oph_reduce\(oph_subarray\(measure,1,120 1,120], \nand then computes the average on the sub-intervals \n[1,30],[31,60],[61-90],[91-120]. Assuming that the arrays \ncontain daily temperature values \(360-value based arrays \naccording to a 360-day calendar, 12 months of 30 days each of data \(four months, from January to \nApril system a HTML based version of the input datacube, \nwhich can be remotely accessed through a web browser. The noperator creates one HTML page for every single fragment and \nbuilds an index page linking all of the other pages. In this case, \nno output datacube is created in the Ophidia data store. The \ninput string for this operator is even simpler than the \nOPH_APPLY one: \n \n operator=oph_publish;datacube_input=cube_in \n \nFinally OPH_CUBE_ELEMENTS computes in parallel \nthe total number of elements stored in a datacube without \ncounting NotANumber values, which are common in sparse \ndatacubes. The input string is similar to the OPH_PUBLISH: \n \n operator=oph_cube_elements;datacube_input=cube_in \n \nNote that the inputs strings reported before contain the nmandatory arguments only. In some cases additional non-\nmandatory arguments are also available \(e.g., the scheduling \npolicy for the distribution task noph_setup_env and oph_cleanup_env interfaces. In the first \ncase \(oph_setup_env the input \nstring arguments against the information related to the input \ndatacube in the OphidiaDB. It then sends the input arguments \nto all slave processes. In the second case \(oph_cleanup_env de-allocate the memory structures previously \nallocated. \nSimilarly, in the three operators, oph_destroy is an empty \nfunction and oph_distribution distributes the fragments among \nthe parallel processes, applying a simple and intuitive \ndistribution algorithm based on the process identifier. \n \nFig. 3. The OPH_APPLY internal diagram. The schema shows how the 7 \nsteps of the analytics framework are mapped onto the implementation of the \nOPH_APPLY operator. \nThe principal differences among the three operators are:  \n OPH_CUBE_ELEMENTS implements the \noph_reduce interface to perform a reduction task and \nsum the total number of elements from the partial \nresults computed by all the processes. The reduction \ntask is not needed by the other two operators; \n5\n• OPH_APPLY and OPH_PUBLISH implement the \noph_init interface to create, respectively the \ndatacube_out entry in the OphidiaDB and the web \ndirectory containing the HTML pages. The nOPH_CUBE_ELEMENT does not need the \nimplementation of this interface since the result is \nmanaged in memory and delivered to the end user as a \nmetadata output information; \n \n \nFig. 4. OPH_CUBE_ELEMENTS internal diagram. The schema shows \nhow the seven steps of the analytics framework are mapped onto the \nimplementation of the OPH_CUBE_ELEMENTS operator. \n• each operator provides a different implementation of noph_execute_operator. OPH_APPLY creates a new set \nof fragments by applying the array-based primitive on \nthe input datacube. OPH_PUBLISH creates a set of \nHTML pages containing all the data reads from the \ninput datacube \(no filtering or data transformations are \napplied by this operator on the input data nOPH_CUBE_ELEMENTS counts the number of \nelements from each fragment by running the following \nSQL statement n \nSELECT sum\(oph_count\(array_attr oph_count nget the number of elements from each tuple \(array_attr \nattribute nnumber of elements related to the table fragment. \nFinally, we note that more complex use cases can be ndefined by simply nesting several operators like in the \nfollowing example: \n \n OPH_PUBLISH\(OPH_APPLY\(OPH_APPLY\(OPH_IMPORT_NC\(input_\nfile nwhich imports the NetCDF input_file file into the Ophidia \ndata store, applies two data transformations transformation1 \nand transformation2 HTTP_folder available in the Ophidia \ninfrastructure. \n \nFig. 5. The OPH_PUBLISH internal diagram. The schema shows how the \nseven steps of the analytics framework are mapped onto the implementation \nof the OPH_PUBLISH operator nE. Operators benchmark: preliminary insights \nA comprehensive evaluation of the Ophidia analytics \nframework is out of the scope of this paper and will be \npresented in future work. However, a preliminary performance n6\nevaluation provides some interesting insights about both the \nanalytics framework and the current implementation of some \nkey operators. The benchmark environment consists of a \ncluster equipped with 12 dual processor nodes IBM iDataplex \n\(2 Intel Sandy Bridge processors, 2x8 cores, 64GB RAM, \n500GB local disk, 20MB chipset cache remaining eight nodes host 4 MySQL servers \neach, which are used for I/O purposes. The MySQL servers are nconfigured with default settings. \nThe benchmark regards two different operators and \northogonal use cases 


n• use case A “compute intensive”: OPH_APPLY applies \na reduce_all_max array-based primitive on a 500GB ndatacube. The datacube is partitioned in 64 fragments \nwith 10^4 tuples \(each tuple stores a 10^5-element narray the \nmaximum element of the array nreduce_all_max primitive. The operator generates an \noutput datacube of about 14MB in size. The runs \ninvolve from 1 to 64 parallel processes. \n• use case B “I/O intensive”: OPH_PUBLISH runs on a \n2.5GB datacube. The datacube is partitioned into 64 \nfragments consisting of 500 tuples each one. Each \ntuple stores a 10^4-element array. The full datacube is \npublished on a 5GB set of HTML pages \(the HTML \ntags and the different way the data is stored – ASCII \ncharacters in HTML files instead of binary data in a \ndatabase table double the datacube size same fragmentation and \ndistribution settings at the node level. More specifically: \n \n§ = 4 \(number of DBMSInstances/IOnode number of databases/DBMSInstance number of fragments/database define the absolute fragmentation index Fi = §*ß*? as \nthe total number of fragments per I/O node, which is equal to 8 \nin both use cases. We plan in future work to study how \nchanging Fi impacts performance: this topic is out of the scope \nof this paper for page limit issues. \nTable II shows the execution time and the efficiency for the \nfirst use case. Efficiency is always more than 95%. As an \nadditional test, doubling the datacube input \(1TB 24 in total 94% on 128 cores. \nTable III presents the results for the second use case. In this \ncase the efficiency is always more than 92%, even though the \ngenerated output is quite different in size \(366 times bigger \nthan in the previous use case cases are quite different in terms of output \nsize and processing needs, they behave in a similar manner and nscale linearly. This is due to several factors: \n• the distributive nature of the two use cases, which \nhelps in having a large number of sub-tasks working in \nparallel without strong communication needs or issues;  \n the low number of fragments does not introduce a high \noverhead both in the distribution and execution tasks n• the analytics framework design which guides the \noperators implementation through seven well defined ninterfaces \(see Section III.B nTable IV shows the different behaviour of the two operators \nin terms of I/O. We see that the aggregate throughput of the I/O \nnodes is small in the OPH_APPLY use case \(less than \n1MB/sec intensive nature of the use case \nand the small output generated.

In future work, we will also evaluate \nperformance when using a different cluster configuration \nnamed super-node, in which all cluster nodes participate in \nboth I/O and compute tasks. \nThus, each node will be used to run the operators as well as \nto host the I/O servers. Preliminary results on a four-node \ncluster configuration are really promising and show that the \ncompute and I/O node difference is basically functional rather \nthan physical \(this means the I/O and compute functionalities \ncan coexist on the same node throughput in the two use \ncases. \nIV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK \nThe Ophidia analytics framework, a core part of the \nOphidia research project, has been presented. As discussed in \nthis work, the analytics framework is responsible for \natomically processing, transforming and manipulating array-\nbased data, by providing a common way to run on large \nclusters analytics tasks applied to big datasets. The paper has \nhighlighted the design principles, the algorithm and the most \nrelevant implementation aspects associated to the Ophidia nanalytics framework. Besides a comprehensive list of the most \nrelevant operators, three of them have been also presented in \ndetail \(OPH_APPLY and OPH_PUBLISH for the data part, \nOPH_CUBE_ELEMENTS for the metadata part OPH_APPLY and OPH_PUBLISH 


nparallel operators to support new scientific use cases. Array-\nbased primitives extensions, a data analytics query language \nand an optimized query planner will be considered to support \nmore complex operators and dataflow driven requests. A \ncomprehensive analytics benchmark will be also defined and \nimplemented to further evaluate the performance of the system. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThis work was supported in part by the Italian Ministry of \nEducation, Universities and Research \(MIUR U.S. Department of Energy, \nOffice of Science through grant DE-AC02-06CH11357. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] S.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
