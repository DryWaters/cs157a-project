Minimizing the \nimpact of disasters is imperative in today’s society. As the \ncapabilities of software and hardware evolve, so does the role \nof information and communication technology in disaster \nmitigation, preparation response, and recovery. A large \nquantity of disaster-related data is available, including \nresponse plans records of previous incidents, simulation data, \nsocial media data, and Web sites. However, current data nmanagement solutions offer few or no integration capabilities. \nMoreover, recent advances in cloud computing big data, and \nNoSQL open the door for new solutions in disaster data \nmanagement.

The case \nstudy presented in this paper illustrates the use of Disaster-\nCDM on an example of simulation models.  \nKeywords: disaster management; cloud computing NoSQL; \nKnowledge as a Service \(KaaS strike across the \nglobe, killing hundreds and causing billions of dollars in \nproperty and infrastructure damage. Extreme weather events \nhave been predicted by climate scientists and have been \nattributed to global warming. As the number of such events \nincreases, minimizing the impact of disasters becomes \nimperative in today’s society.  \nThe role of information and communication technology \nin disaster management has been evolving. Large quantities \nof disaster-related data are being generated. Behaviour of \ncritical infrastructures is being explored through simulation, \nresponse plans are being created by government agencies nand individual organizations, sensory systems are providing \npotentially relevant information, and social media \(Twitter, \nFacebook  disparate and provide few \nor no integration capabilities. To make the most of available \ninformation, a reliable and scalable storage system supported \nby information sharing, reuse, integration, and analysis is nneeded. \nIn other domains, recent advances in cloud computing, \nbig data, and NoSQL have been changing how data are \ncaptured, stored, and analyzed. NoSQL solutions have been \nespecially popular in Web applications 2], including \nFacebook, Twitter, and Google. However, the use of cloud \nand NoSQL solutions in disaster management has been \nsparse.  \nA solution to store disaster related data in a cloud \nenvironment can provide the following benefits to disaster \nmanagement [3]: \n High availability. Within the cloud environment, data nare automatically replicated, often across large \ngeographic distances. If a region is affected by a disaster nand a local data centre fails, the system remains \navailable because it can switch to another data centre. \n Scalability and elasticity. The amount of disaster-related \ndata is immense, and a cloud solution could adapt nstorage resources based on real time needs and priorities. \nData can be automatically redistributed to take nadvantage of heterogeneous servers.  \n There is no need for a large initial investment. The \nsystem can start small and be expanded by adding \nheterogeneous nodes as needed.  \nMoreover, NoSQL databases have a number of \ncharacteristics that can benefit disaster management, \nincluding [4]: \n Flexible data structure Disaster data are extremely \ndiverse, and therefore it would be almost impossible to \nstore them in a predetermined data structure. \n Great horizontal scalability. NoSQL databases were \ndesigned for a cloud environment, and therefore they \nscale easily over a large number of commodity servers. \n Performance. For simple read/write operations, NoSQL \ndatabases can provide excellent performance. \nConsequently, this paper proposes a Knowledge as a Service \n\(KaaS Disaster-CDM 20] aims to generate from stored \ndata in a cloud environment, knowledge such as advice or \nresponse to meet organizational needs.

conclusions and future work are presented in \nSection V. \nII. RELATED WORK \nResearch in disaster management involves many fields, \nincluding health science, environmental science, computer \nscience, and a number of engineering disciplines. Crisis \ninformatics [5,6], the area of research concerned with the \nrole of information and technology in disaster management, \nhas been attracting increased research attention recently nHristidis et al. [1] surveyed data management and \nanalysis in the disaster domain. The main focus of their nsurvey was on data analysis techniques without the storage \naspect. In contrast, in Disaster-CDM, storage and analysis \nare considered as integral parts. Hristidis et al. identified the \nfollowing data analysis technologies as relevant in disaster \ndata management: information extraction, information \nretrieval information filtering, data mining, and decision \nsupport. Similarly, Disaster-CDM uses a number of ntechnologies from information extraction and retrieval. The \nsurvey reveals that the majority of research has focused on a \nvery narrow area of disaster management, for example, a \nspecific disaster event such as an earthquake or a flood, or \nspecific disaster-related activities such as communication \namong actors estimating disaster damage, and use of mobile \ndevices. Hristidis et al. recognized the need for flexible and ncustomizable disaster-management solutions that could be \napplied in different disaster situations Disaster-CDM aims to \nprovide such a solution using cloud and NoSQL approaches. \nSilva et al. [7] aimed to integrate diverse, distributed \ninformation sources by bringing them into a standardized \nand exchangeable common data format. Their approach \nfocused on data available on public Web sites. Data were \nfirst extracted from different source Web sites and stored in a \nrelational database. Next, the data were transformed into nLinked Open Data \(LOD sites, \nthe proposed Disaster-CDM can accommodate various \ninformation sources. In addition, Disaster-CDM is designed \nfor high availability and large amounts of data. \nPalen et al. [5] presented a vision of technology-\nsupported public participation during disaster events. They \nfocused on the role of the public in disasters and how \ninformation and communication technology can transform \nthat role. Similarly to [1], they recognized information \nintegration as a core concern in crisis informatics.  \nAnderson and Schram [8], like Palen et al. [5], studied \nthe role of public and social media in disaster events. They \nproposed a crisis-informatics data analytic infrastructure for \nthe collection, analysis, and storage of information from nTwitter. The main objective of their work was the support of \nother crisis information research by extracting disaster-\nrelated tweets from Twitter and storing them in a database. \nIn their initial study [8], data were stored in a relational \ndatabase, specifically MySQL. Later, after encountering \nscalability challenges, they transitioned to a hybrid \narchitecture that incorporates relational and NoSQL \ndatabases [6]. Similarly Disaster-CDM also uses a \ncombination of relational and NoSQL databases. However, a \ncombination of several NoSQL databases has been used to \naddress the storage requirements of diverse data. \nSpecifically Disaster-CDM allows choice of storage \nsolutions to suit data structures and access patterns. For \nexample ontologies are stored in a graph database because \nontologies closely resemble a graph structure.  \nTo provide disaster knowledge services, Disaster-CDM \nuses a KaaS approach. Within KaaS, a knowledge provider \nanswers requests presented by knowledge consumers \nthrough knowledge services [9]. This approach has been \nused in various domains including disaster management [10, \n11, 21]. Lino et al. [21] discuss KaaS for emergency nresponse in natural disasters like tsunami and earthquakes, \nwhich is restricted to Interactive Digital TV In Disaster-\nCDM, KaaS is suitable for accommodating structured and \nunstructured data stored in relational and NoSQL databases. \nIII. DISASTER-CDM ARCHITECTURE \nThe heterogeneity of the data involved in disaster-related \nactivities is one of the main challenges in providing a \ncomprehensive solution that could be used by various \nstakeholders in diverse disaster situations. Disaster-CDM \naddresses this challenge using the KaaS approach; disaster-\nrelated knowledge is provided as a knowledge service. \nThe Disaster-CDM architecture is illustrated in Fig. 1. It \nconsists of two parts: knowledge acquisition and knowledge ndelivery services. Knowledge acquisition is responsible for \nacquiring knowledge from diverse sources processing it to \nadd structure to unstructured or semi-structured data, and \nstoring it in databases. Data are stored in a cloud \nenvironment, specifically in a variety of relational and \nNoSQL databases. The second part, knowledge delivery \nservices, is responsible for integrating information from \ndifferent databases and delivering knowledge to consumers. \nIt was decided to process the information and to store the \nprocessed enriched data because the time required for \nqueries and information integration would be compatible \nwith near real-time requirements of emergency situations.  \nTherefore, this will allow shorter response time to the queries \nthan performing the processing “on the fly”. \nThe main reasons for choosing storage in a cloud nenvironment are 1 a large \nnumber of commodity servers. \nThe following two sections describe the two main parts \nof 


Disaster-CDM: knowledge acquisition and knowledge \ndelivery.  \nA. Knowledge acquisition \nThe Disaster-CDM knowledge acquisition function obtains \ndata from heterogeneous data sources, processes them, and \nstores them in the cloud environment.  \n311294\n  \nFigure 1.  Disaster-CDM architecture. \n1 few examples of information related to disasters are \ndisaster plans, incident reports, situation reports social \nmedia, simulation models including infrastructure and \nhealth-care simulation. As for representation formats, \nexamples include MS Word, pdf, xml, a variety of image \nformats \(jpeg, png, tiff model formats \nspecific to simulation packages. Data representation is \nimportant because it determines the methods that can be used \nto add structure to unstructured or semi-structured data.  \nFrom our experience working with local disaster-\nmanagement agencies, the majority of information is stored \nin unformatted documents, primarily pdf and MS Word files. \nThis agrees with the work of Hristidis et al. [1], who \nreported that most information is in pdf and MS Word files. \n2 they cannot be \nprocessed using a single approach. Therefore, the processing \nis driven by the input data and by data processing rules, as \nillustrated in Fig. 1. Data processing rules specify what \nprocesses are to be applied to which input data and in which \norder. For example, a pdf incident report must go through file nmetadata separation, text extraction, and pattern processing. \nThe main processes with their associated outputs are \nincluded in Fig. 1. However, Disaster-CDM can be easily \nexpanded to include new data processing methods. \nText Extraction from Images recognizes the text in an \nimage and separates it [12]. This step prepares images and \npdf files for other processing steps such as tagging. Text \nextraction is especially important in the case of diagrams \nsuch as flowcharts or event-driven process chains because \nthese documents contain large amounts of text that can be \nused for tagging. MS Word documents also go through text nextraction because they often contain images that may \ninclude relevant information.  \nFile Metadata Separation makes use of file and \ndirectory attributes, including file name, creation date, last \nmodified date, owner, and access permissions. File names \nthemselves carry important information about content \nbecause they are typically chosen with the aim of describing \nthe content. They are processed to separate the words ncontained in the file name. Keywords can also be used in the \nfile name as a descriptive metadata. The creation date and \nlast modified date can assist in distinguishing newer and \npotentially more relevant information from older and \npossibly outdated information. The file directory structure \ncontains additional information about file content such as file \nstructure \(table of content norganize files. Directories can be seen as a categorization and \ntherefore should be included in metadata separation.  \nPattern Processing makes use of existing patterns within \ndocuments to extract the desired structure. Hristidis et al. [1] \nobserved that most available information is stored in \nunstructured documents, but that “typically the same \norganization follows a similar format for all its reports” [1 nTherefore, it is feasible to use patterns for information \nextraction. However, the number of organizations involved \n312295\nin disaster management is large, which may result in a large \nnumber of patterns. This represents a challenge because the \npatterns need to be identified before pattern processing can \nbe applied Another challenge is with new sources where \npeople must be involved in identifying patterns.  \nSimulation Model Transformation is the process of \nconverting simulation models into a representation which \nenables model queries and integration with other disaster-\nrelated data. Simulation is considered especially important nfor this project because it involves various domains which \nare crucial to disaster management. Therefore simulation-\nrelated activities are described here in more detail.  \nAlthough the act of simulation is not domain-specific, \nsimulation packages are usually application-oriented, \nmeaning that they are designed for simulation experiments in \na specific domain. These packages use different modeling \napproaches and domain-specific vocabularies and store \nsimulation models in simulation-engine-specific file formats. \nSuch simulation models cannot be directly queried, nor can \nthey be integrated with other disaster-related data nTo extract as much information as possible from \nsimulation model files, an ontology-based representation of nsimulation models has been used [13]. Unlike text-\nprocessing approaches, an ontology-based representation nmakes it possible to 1 nontologies do not have predefined schemata, and 3 transformation of simulator model files to their \ncorresponding ontology-based models requires two nsimulator-specific entities to be created for each simulator: a \nsimulator ontology, which identifies the simulator’s building \nblocks [14]; and a simulation model reader [13], which is \nresponsible for reading the simulator model files. Once those \ntwo entities have been created for a specific simulator, any \nmodel represented in that format can be transformed to its \nontology-based representation.  \nTagging and semantic annotation. Tagging is the \nprocess of attaching keywords or terms to a piece of \ninformation with the 


objective of assisting in classification, \nidentification, or search [15]. Semantic annotations \nadditionally specify how entities are related. In disaster-\nmanagement data tagging, both manual and automated \ntagging are needed. Automated tagging applies various \nnatural language processing \(NLP add tags automatically to pieces of \ninformation. Because disaster data are immensely diverse, it \nmight not be feasible to tag all content automatically. Images \nare examples of data which may require computationally nexpensive tagging. Therefore, manual tagging is used to \nsupplement the automated approach. Tagging will be nexplored first, and semantic annotations will be addressed in \nlater stages of the project. \n3 in the Cloud Environment \nRelational databases \(RDBs structured data. They have been used \nfor decades due to their reliability, consistency, and query ncapabilities through a standard SQL language. However, \nthey do not gracefully meet mass data needs. In other words, \nRDBs exhibit horizontal scalability challenges, big data \ninefficiencies, and limited availability 16].  \nIn this context, the next generation of databases, namely \nNoSQL databases, have been designed for a distributed \nenvironment [3]. They are mainly dedicated to projects that \nare distributed, that involve large amounts of data, or that \nmust scale. In the case of simple operations, NoSQL \ndatabases improve performance relative to traditional RDBs.  \nDisaster-CDM, as illustrated in Fig. 1, uses both \nrelational and NoSQL databases. Even though there are four \nmain categories of NoSQL databases [4], Disaster-CDM \nuses only three The following discussion introduces all four \ncategories and explains the choice of not including key-value ndatabases in Disaster-CDM architecture. \nKey-value databases are used for fast and simple \noperations. They have the simplest data model: they provide \na simple mapping from the key to the corresponding value. \nWhen using a key-value database, relations between data are \nhandled at the application level. This data model greatly \nrestricts integration capabilities, and therefore it is not \nincluded in Disaster-CDM. \nDocument databases offer a flexible data model with \nquery possibilities. They focus on optimized storage and \naccess for semi-structured documents as opposed to rows or \nrecords. Document databases are considered an evolution of \nkey-value databases because they include all the benefits of \nthe key-value databases while adding query capabilities. \nColumn-family databases are suitable for very large \ndatasets which have to be scaled at larger size. On the \nsurface, they are similar to relational databases, but the \ndifference lies on how they store the data. A relational \ndatabase stores data by rows, while a column-family \ndatabase stores them by columns Each column is identified \nby a key value \(row databases provide query capabilities. \nGraph databases are specialized for efficient \nmanagement of heavily linked data. Applications based on \ndata with many relationships are well suited for graph \ndatabases because the cost of intensive operations like \nrecursive “join” operation can be replaced by efficient graph ntraversals [4].  \nDespite the advantages of NoSQL databases, Disaster-\nCDM also accommodates relational databases. RDBs are \nstill an appropriate solution for many applications because of \ntheir characteristics such as ACID transactions, their status \nas an established technology, and their advanced query \ncapabilities Moreover, existing data in relational databases \ndo not need to be migrated. However, integration among nrelational and NoSQL databases is a challenge. Part of this \nchallenge is the fact that NoSQL databases do not support a \nstandard query language.  \nB. Knowledge delivery \nThe Disaster-CDM knowledge delivery service will \nanswer information requests submitted by service consumers \nby integrating information stored in the cloud. As presented \nin Fig. 1, data access is mainly composed of three parts: \n313296\n Ontologies: These provide an overall view of the local \nontologies representing each database independently of \nits category Ontologies represent the mapping between \nheterogeneous sources which is needed to unify query \ncapabilities n Data interfaces: After querying the ontology, it is \nnecessary to access the data. Data interfaces enable ntranslation of the generic query into a specific language \nthat corresponds to the underlying database system. \nThus, the data stored in heterogeneous sources can be \naccessed, analyzed, and administered. \n Services: This is the access layer for users. It provides \nservices independently of how the data are stored Thus, \nusers are unaware of the storage architecture and are \nprovided with a unified view of the data nSecurity and privacy are outside the scope of this work; \nhowever, they are included in Fig. 1 to underline their \nimportance. \nIV. CASE STUDY \nThe use of the proposed Disaster-CDM will be \ndemonstrated here on an example including simulation \nmodels. This choice is motivated by the importance of \nsimulation in a number of domains crucial for disaster \nmanagement. Moreover, simulation models contain complex \ninformation that should be preserved in the transformation \nprocess. The complexity and heterogeneity of simulation \nmodels represents a challenge for storage and integration.  \nSpecifically, the I2Sim [17] model, which was developed \nfor the investigation of infrastructure interdependencies, is \nused. I2Sim is an interdependency simulator built upon nMATLAB’s Simulink engine. Simulink provides block \nlibraries which can be customized to conform to a specific 


nsimulation domain. Complex models are managed by \ndividing models into hierarchies of sub-models nAccordingly, I2Sim builds upon Simulink by customizing \nSimulink blocks and providing entities specific to ninfrastructure interdependency simulation.  \nThe I2Sim simulator model used in this case study was \ndeveloped to investigate infrastructure interdependencies in \nan incident on the Western University campus. The model ninvolves a number of infrastructures, including electricity, \nwater, and steam distribution. It is complex and consists of \nseveral hierarchy levels. These hierarchy levels hide \ncomplexity and aid in model creation and management; \nhowever, they pose a challenge for model checking. To \nverify that the model conforms to a specific requirement, the \nuser typically must open and review each sub-model in the \nhierarchy. Storing ontology-base representations in a \ndatabase provides querying abilities and thus facilitates \nmodel checking The simulation models are first processed to \nconvert them into ontology-based models; then they are \nsaved in a cloud database. \nA. Simulation model processing \n As described in Section III.A.2, simulation models are nprocessed by transforming each simulator-specific \nproprietary model to its corresponding ontology-based nmodel. In the case of I2Sim, the simulator model is stored in \na Simulink-style .mdl file. The transformation of this .mdl \nfile to an ontology-based model has been described in [13]. \nThe transformation approach [13 enables the representation \nof ontology-based models in different ontology languages. In \nthis case study, OWL 18] was used because it is the W3C-\nrecommended ontology language. Simulation model used in \nthis case study resulted in an ontology-based model with 679 \ninstances and 6575 property assertions.  \nB. Storing simulation models \nDisaster-CDM is designed to enable the choice of a \nstorage solution that corresponds to the data requirements in \nterms of data structure as well as access patterns.  \nAfter the simulation models have been transformed into \nontology-based models they are represented in OWL, which \nis characterized by a formal semantic and an abstract \nontology structure that can be perceived as a graph. \nGraph databases use graph structures with nodes, edges, \nand properties to represent and store data. They are \noptimized for efficient management and storage of graph- \nlike data. Consequently, because ontologies can be perceived \nas graphs, it is apparent that graph databases are a good \nchoice for storing ontologies as well as ontology-based nsimulation models. Another characteristic that makes a graph \ndatabase a good choice is its query capabilities. Graph \ndatabase implementations typically offer query capabilities \nusing specialized graph query languages. Specifically, this \ncase study uses the Neo4j graph database [19]. Neo4j can be \nqueried using Cypher, a proprietary graph query language \ndeveloped by Neo4j; using Gremlin, a graph traversal nlanguage; or even using the RDF query language, SPARQL. \nThe processing stage creates ontology-based nrepresentations of simulation models in the OWL language. \nNext, these ontologies are loaded into Neo4j Because Neo4j \nis a graph database and OWL ontologies are forms of graphs, \nloading ontologies into the database proved to be \nstraightforward. Loading our use case model into a database \nresulted in a graph with 2533 vertices and 9724 edges. \nAfter ontology-based models are stored in a database, \nthey can be queried what makes it possible to perform \nmodel checking that otherwise would be done manually. \nThis can be illustrated using an example involving channels \nand production cells. In simple terms, an I2Sim production ncell is an entity that transforms inputs into outputs, while a \nchannel transports entities. It was necessary to find which \nproduction cells were directly connected by channels. To do \nthis directly on the I2Sim model the user needs to check \neach channel to determine whether it directly connects to \nproduction cells. The hierarchy of sub-models makes this \ntask especially challenging because each sub-model needs to \nbe checked as well.  \nHowever, Disaster-CDM provides querying for model \nchecking. In the following query, SPARQL is used to list all \nproduction cells that are directly connected by a channel, \ntogether with the sub-models to which they belong: \nSELECT ?cell1Name ?cell2Name ?subModel1 ?subModel2 \nWHERE {?cell1 a i2sim:production_cell n?cell2 a i2sim:production_cell. \n?cell1 simmodel:Name ?cell1Name. \n?cell2 simmodel:Name ?cell2Name n314297\n?channel simupper:hasStartNode ?cell1. \n?channel simupper:hasEndNode ?cell2. \n?cell1 i2sim:parentSystem ?subModel1. \n?cell1 i2sim:parentSystem ?subModel2.} \nInstead of each sub-model having to be checked \nmanually, this query provides a unified view of all \nproduction cells, in all sub-models, that are directly \nconnected by channels. The first few rows of the results of \nthis query are displayed in Table I Note that the names of \nthe connected production cells in the first two rows are \nidentical. However, the first row indicates a connection in \nthe steam_house-boiler_3 sub-model and the second row a \nconnection in steam_house-boiler_2. The same query could \nhave been executed against OWL ontology without storing \nthe ontology in the database. However, disaster management \ndeals with a large number of simulation models making the \nuse of a database preferable to store ontologies as OWL files.  \nThis section presented a simple case study that has been \nintended to illustrate how Disaster-CDM can be used in \norder to provide a high-available, scalable and low-cost \nsolution to manage heterogeneity and semantics in \nlarge/complex 


simulation models to benefit disaster \nmanagement through the use of the cloud environment. \nV. CONCLUSIONS nIn recent years, we have witnessed a number of extreme \nweather events and natural disasters. At the same time, \nchanges in software and hardware have created opportunities \nfor new solutions in disaster management nThis paper has proposed Disaster-CDM, a KaaS \nframework for disaster data management. Disaster-CDM \nstores large amounts of data while maintaining high \navailability by using NoSQL and cloud solutions. Search of ndisaster data, interoperability, and integration are facilitated \nthrough knowledge acquisition and knowledge delivery. \nKnowledge acquisition applies language processing, \ninformation extraction, and retrieval techniques to add \nstructure and metadata to largely unstructured disaster data. \nKnowledge delivery services integrate information from \ndifferent databases and deliver knowledge to consumers. \nDisaster-CDM is still at the design stage, and only a part \nof the simulation model data acquisition process is included \nin this work The remaining part of the framework will need \nto be implemented to evaluate the entire framework fully. \nThe critical aspects of the knowledge acquisition stage that \nneed to be addressed are the integration of heterogeneous \ntechnologies and the criteria for optimal data storage \nselection. The main challenge for the knowledge delivery \ninvolves the semantic integration of diverse data sources. \nKaaS approach will also be applied to other domains with \nsimilar requirements such as healthcare. \nTABLE I.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of our algo­\nrithms. Our parallel algorithms' accuracy is demonstrated \nby showing that the algorithm produces networks with power \nlaw degree distribution. Then we present the strong and \nweak scaling of the algorithms. These algorithms scale very \nwell with the number of processors. We also present ex­\nperimental results showing the impact of the partitioning \nschemes on load balancing and performance of the algo­\nrithms. \n4.1 Experimental Setup \nWe used a high performance computing cluster of 48 Intel \nSandy Bridge nodes. Each node consists of two dual-socket \nIntel Sandy Bridge E5-26 70 2.60GHz 8-core processors \(16 ncores per node inter­\nconnects. For the MPI based implementation of our algo­\nrithms, we used the MPICH2 \(version 1 . 7 which optimized \nfor QLogic InfiniBand cards. \nIn the experiments, we used up to 768 processors. We \nvaried n from 107 to 109 and x from 4 to 10. Each of the \nalgorithms we considered generates the network in the main nmemory, and the runtime does not include the time required \nto write the graph into the disk. \n4.2 Degree Distribution \nThe degree distribution of the graph generated by our \nparallel algorithm is shown in Figure 4 in a log -log scale. \nWe used n = 109 nodes each adding x = 4 new edges with \na total of 4 x 109 edges. \nAs the figure shows, the distribution is heavy tailed, which \nis a distinct feature of the real-world power-law networks. \nThe exponent I of this power-law degree distribution is mea­\nsured to be 2. 7, which supports the fact that for a finite av­\nerage degree of a scale-free network, the exponent I satisfies \n2 < I < 00 [9]. The above results show that our algorithms \nproduce scale-free networks very accurately. \n4.3 Strong Scaling nStrong scaling of a parallel algorithm shows its perfor­\nmance with the increasing number of processors keeping the \nproblem size fixed. Figure 5 shows speedup factors of our \nalgorithms with partitioning schemes uniform consecutive \nFigure 4: The degree distribution \(in log -log scale parallel algorithms. \nThe network is generated with n = 109 and x = 4. \n\(UCP LCP round-robin parti­\ntioning \(RRP Speedup factors are mea­\nsured as 1?/1?, where 1? and 1? are the running time of \na sequential algorithm and the parallel algorithm, respec­\ntively. We have implemented the sequential version of our \nalgorithm in C This sequential implementation outper­\nforms the best available implementation of BA model given \nin NetworkX graph algorithm library [16]. As the sequential \nalgorithm cannot generate more than 6 x 109 edges due to nmemory limitation, we choose n = 109 and x = 6. We varied \nthe number of processors from 1 to 768 for this experiment. \n250 \n200 \ni150 \n[t100 \n50 \n200 400 600 \nNumber of Processors \n_ucp \n........ LCP \n...... RRP nFigure 5: The strong scaling of our parallel algo­\nrithms for the problem size n = 109 and x = 6 nParallelization of network algorithms is notoriously hard. \nFurthermore, we have observed that the problem of gener­\nating a scale-free random network is quite sequential in na­\nture due to the dependencies among the edges. As Figure 5 \nshows, the speedups of our algorithms are increasing almost \nlinearly with the number of processors. Given the sequen­\ntial nature of the problem, our algorithms show very good \nspeedup. Further, the speedup of both LCP and RRP is \nbetter than UCP, due to better load-balancing as discussed \nin Section 4.6 n4.4 Weak Scaling \nThe weak scaling measures the performance of a parallel \nalgorithm when the input size per processor remains con­\nstant. For this experiment, we varied the number of pro­\ncessors from 16 to 768. With the number of processors, the \ninput size is also increased proportionally: for P processors, \na network with 107 P edges is generated. Figure 6 shows the \nweak scaling of our algorithms with the increasing number \nof procesors. \nIn a perfect weak scaling case, the runtime is expected to \nremain constant as the number of processors \(P nFigure 6: Weak scaling of our parallel PA algorithm. \nHowever, in practice, communication among processors in­\ncreases with P, leading to an increase in runtime. Our al­\ngorithm with load balancing schemes LCP and RRP show \nvery good weak scaling, almost constant runtime. Again, \ndue to poor load balancing in UCP scheme, we 


have worse \nweak scaling. \n4.5 Generating Large Networks \nOur main goal for designing this algorithm is to generate \nvery large random networks. Using our algorithm with the \nRRP scheme, we are able to generate a network with 50 \nbillion edges, with n = IE and x = 5. Using 768 processors, \nthe generation of this network takes only 123 seconds. \n4.6 Partitioning and Load Balancing \nN ode partitioning has significant effects on load balanc­\ning and performance of the algorithm. In Section 3.5, we \nhave discussed three partitioning schemes UCP, LCP and \nRRP, and theoretically analyzed them. In this section, we \nexperimentally study these schemes and their effect on the \nperformance of the algorithm. In these experiments, we use \nn = 108 nodes, x 10 edges per node, and 160 processors. \n160 processors are sufficient to demonstrate the behavior and ndifferences of the partitioning schemes. For each of the three \nschemes, we measure the computational load in the proces­\nsors by the number of nodes per processor, the number of \noutgoing messages from the processors and the number of \nincoming messages to the processors. The results are shown \nin Figure 7. \n4.6.1 Node Distribution \nThe node distribution is shown in Figure 7\(a uniformly among the pro­\ncessors, and each processor has about 62,500 nodes. For \nLCP, the number of nodes in the processors are increasing \nlinearly with the rank of the processors. \n4.6.2 Message Distribution \nIn a consecutive partitioning \(UCP and LCP and \nreceives incoming messages from processors i + 1 to P - 1 .  \nFor each node, a processor sends a request message with \nprobability at most 1 - p \(see Eqn. 2 a processor is propor­\ntional to the number of nodes in the processor, as shown \nin Figure 7\(b the UCP and LCP schemes, \nprocessor 0 does not need to send any request messages at \nall. \nFigure 7\(c the number of incoming request mes­\nsages for each processor.

Figure 7\( d shows the total load for the three par­\ntitioning schemes. Scheme RRP distributes the load almost \nperfectly among the processors. Load balancing in the LCP \nscheme is also quite good. On the other hand, UCP scheme ndistribute the load very poorly. These experimental results \nverify our theoretical analysis given in Section 3.5. \n5. CONCLUSION \nWe developed a parallel algorithm to generate massive \nscale-free networks using the preferential attachment model. \nWe analyzed the dependency nature of the problem in detail \nthat led to the development of an efficient parallel algorithm \nfor the problem. Various node partitioning schemes and \ntheir effect on the algorithm were discussed as well. Our \nalgorithm produces networks which strictly follow power-law \ndistribution. The linear scalability of our algorithm enables \nus to produce 50 billion edges in just 123 seconds. It will be \ninteresting to develop scalable parallel algorithms for other \nclasses of random networks in the future. \n6. REFERENCES \n[1] R. Albert, H. Jeong, and A.-L. Barabasi.

PARTITIONING SCHEME \nIn this section, we describe some additional details of the \npartitioning schemes. For a given n nodes and P processors, \nwe create P partitions Vo, V1 , . . .  Vp-1 . The processors are \nlabeled as 0, 1 ,  . . .  P - 1. Partition Vi is processed by pro­\ncessor i. For each scheme, we need to know i of nodes in each partition, and iii Below we show how to calculate them for the three \npartitioning schemes. \nA.1 Uniform Consecutive Partitioning UCP assigned to the par­\ntitions. \nPartition size: The sizes of the partitions are almost equal. \nLet B = I f5 l Then, the size of a partition is either B or \nB -1. \nPartition range: Partition i includes the nodes from iB nto \(i  + I III J . \nA.2 Linear Consecutive Partitioning \(LCP par­\ntitions, and the number of nodes in the partitions are mod­\neled by arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d a+\(P- l are partition pal'ame­\nters.

Parameter d 


is the slope \nof the straight line y = a + dx, where y represent the num­\nber of nodes in the processor with rank x = i. We calcu­\nlate d by finding two points on this straight line. Putting \ni = 0 and i = P -1 in Eqn 10, we can compute nl and \nnp- l .  Then, the number of nodes in the first processor is \nnl - no = nl and the number of nodes in last processor is \nnp - np- l = n - 1 - np- l .

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
