INTRODUCTION \nThe explosive growth of information has taken us into \nthe era of big data. The features of big data have raised \nchallenges to traditional data management systems. 1?Mass: \nnew IDC Digital Universe study show that from 2005 to \n2020, the dig ital universe will grow from 130 exabytes to n40,000 exabytes, or 40 trillion gigabytes \(more than 5,200 \ngigabytes for every man, woman, and child in 2020  3?Heterogeneity: data schema, \nstorage format and operation system among the databases are \ndistinct 4?Diversity: data are available in various formats \nsuch as relational data, XML, HTML, image, video and naudio. \nTraditional data management systems can hardly meet \nthe demand of big data management and evolution In spite \nof the great success of relational database management \nsystem in dealing with structured data, it is particularly \ninadequate in managing massive, distributed, heterogeneous \nand diverse data. 1?For such a massive scale of data, \nsemantic integration rather than simple storage is necessary. \n2?The diversity of data schema and format  hinders the \nunification of data model, especially for non-structured data \nsuch as images and audios. Under the circumstances, \ndataspace was put forward as a new service mode for b ig \ndata management.  \nWe propose virtual dataspace \(VDS scientific \ndomain [2]. The VDS model is regarded as the development \nand innovation of DataSpace. VDS refers to a set of subject, \ndata, and flexible services constructed by virtual \ntechnologies. VDS masks the complexity of data integration, \ndata relationship, format diversity and provide various \nflexible data services on the basis. That is what we called \nvirtualization. There are two major issues in the VDS model n1?Semantic integration of heterogeneous data source. 2?\ndata relationship construction and data evolution Local \nontologies are created from data sources. Then the local \nontologies are mapped and formed a global ontology. Based \non this, access log and user feedback are considered for data \nevolution. At last, a material scientists -oriented service \n\(materials scholar assistant is structured as follows. We state the challenge \nof data management in section 1. Section 2 provides the nreader with related research while section 3 explains the \ntechnical details along with the realization of VDS. An \napplication case of data evolution in VDS is introduced in \nsection 4. Finally, the conclusion and remarks on future work \nare given in section 5. \nII. RELATED WORK\nAs the challenges raised for traditional data management \nsystems, a new data management technology has become a \nkey necessity. M. Franklin proposed the idea of dataspace to \ntackle data management issue in 2005[3]. Since then \nconsiderable attention has been given to dataspace research \nconcerning data model [4,5], link data[6,7] and data query[8]. \nResearch about dataspace is still in its infancy, there are only \na few prototype systems such as iMeMex[9], Semex[10] and nOrientSpace[11,12,13]. \nJ. Dittrich et al. proposed a platform for personal \ndataspace management [9]. They defined a unified data \nmodel that allows the integration of information in \ndistributed and heterogeneous data sources. A new search \nand query language over this data model was also developed \nalong with algorithms for the efficient processing of complex \nqueries. This system has developed a queryable and \nupdatable view on the user’s personal information. However, \nsemantic query is not supported by iQL. \nA Domain Model-based personal information \nmanagement system known as Semex was developed by \nDong X. et al.[10]. Semex consists of 3 sub-modules which \nare domain management module, data collection module and \n2013 Fourth International Conference on  Emerging Intelligent Data and Web Technologies\n978-0-7695-5044-2/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/EIDWT.2013.5\n1\ndata analysis module. Domain Model provides the logical \nview of one’s personal information, based on meaningful \nobjects and associations. The data collection module is \nresponsible for data extraction, integration, cleaning and \nindexing. The data analysis module analyzes data for search \nand browsing. Semantic information was considered when \nintegrating user’s personal information through Domain nModel. Unfortunately, a bad domain model will seriously \naffected system performance.  \nLi Y introduced “core space” model and “task space” \nmodel for constructing the personal dataspace \(PDS OrientSpace[11,12,13]. OrientSpace is a \nuser-centered system which takes Objective Semantic Link \n\(OSL 


Memory-based Semantic Link \(MSL nfacilitates better services. Although behavior of subjects has \nbeen fully considered in the system, it’s only for personal \ninformation management and has very limited applicability.  \nAs a new data management technology, research of \ndataspace is still in early stages. The number of prototype \nsystem is rather limited, let alone scientific domain-specific \nmodel. Dataspace model in scientific domain is a fertile field nfor study. \nIII. VIRTUAL DATASPACE MODEL\nA. Virtual Dataspace \nDataspace is a new data management model which nconsists of subject, data and data relationships. The VDS \nmodel is regarded as the development and innovation of \nDataSpace. VDS is a set of subject, data, and flexible on-\ndemand services constructed by virtual technologies. VDS \nmask the complexity of data integration, data relationship \nand format diversity and provide various flexible data \nservices on the basis. That is what we called virtualization. \nAs shown in Fig.1, VDS consists of semantic integration \nmodule, data evolution module and data service module. \nDB DB DB\nXML XML XML\nLocal Ontologies\nData Sources\nGlobal Ontology\nData Services\nSemantic Integration\nData Evolution\nWorkflow\nCustomization\nE-Science\nCooperation\nData\nVisualization\nScholar\nAssistant\nSemantic\nQuery\nKey word\nSearch\n. . .\nAccess Log\nFeedback\nEvaluate\nInterest Ontology\nInterest Ontology\nEvolution\nFigure 1.

Mapping between Database elements and OWL elements. \nB. Semantic Integration of Virtual Dataspace \nThere are several data formats in VDS such as structured, \nsemi-structured and non-structured files. We complete data \nintegration of diverse format based on ontology technology. \n1 relational \ndatabase systems to manage and organize data. Relationships \nbetween entities are represented by relations which are \nactually refer to two-dimensional tables. Rows in  the tables\nare called tuples and columns in the tables are called \nattributes [14]. Relational database is regarded as the \ncomposition of tables, rows, columns and constrains. \nOntology is a concept introduced from philosophy area \nby experts of artificial intelligence domain. Asuncion[15] et \nal. reorganized the concept of ontology and proposed a nquintuple method to describe it. The quintuple consists of \nclass, relation, function, axiom and instance nWe define five rules to transform relat ional databases to \nOWL ontology based on the definition of them, as shown in \nFig.2.  \nIn this paper, extraction from database to OWL ontology \nis divided into two parts: the information extraction part and \nthe db-ontology transformation part. The framework is \nshown in Fig.3. \nThe related schema informat ion extracted from database \nis regarded as the semantic information of ontology. Both of \nschema and data are transferred to the ontology mapper. \nRelated ontologies are automatic created according to the \nrules defined in Fig.2 and the information in  the ontology \nmapper. \n2 Ontology \nXML is a standard for data exchange proposed by W3C in \n1998, it’s a serious of markup languages XML has \nadvantages such as self-describing, scalability, separation of \ndata and representation and easy for programming.

Mapping between XML Elements and OWL Elements. \n\(Document Type Definit ion and XML Schema are two \nmethods to describe meta data in XML. We adopt XML \nSchema to describe XML in VDS nXML element includes node and attribute. Mapping from \nXML to OW L ontology is divided into content mapping and \nrelationship mapping. Fig.4 shows the mapping between \nXML elements and OWL elements. \nContent mapping XML nodes are mapped into OWL \nclasses and XML attributes are mapped into OWL data \nproperties. Relationship mapping: parent-child relationships \nin XML are mapped into class -subclass relationships of \nOWL ontology and element-attribute relationships in XML \nare mapped into class-data property relationships of OWL \nontology n3 data sources or local ontologies and provides a \nunified view for user. It unifies semantic expression of ndomain vocabulary based on the mappings among local \nontologies. \nIn VDS, transformation from local ontologies to global \nontology is complete by ontology mapping[16]. Ontology \nmapping is an iterative process which mainly includes \nfeature extraction, user interaction, similarity computing and \nmapping discovery nFeature extraction: Information such as concepts, \nindividuals and relations are extracted from heterogeneous nontologies. \nUser interaction: Some concept pairs are mapped \nmanually before or after the mapping process nSimilarity computing: Similarit ies of concept pairs are \ncalculated by the compositive measure. More details for \nsimilarity computing is described in [16]. \nMapping discovery: The threshold is set to 0.7. The \nconcept pairs of which the similarity value in the \ncompositive matrix is greater than 0.7 will be mapped nIteration: The accuracy of ontology mapping will be \nimproved by the iteration of the process. \nFig.5 shows the mapping process. \nFeature\nExtraction\nInput

Data Evolution in VDS \nBeing trapped in the ocean of data, the users are bothered \nwith many unrelated information Existing data service has \npoor user experience as they simply provides data to users \nwithout semantic. Thus in VDS the semantic relationships \nare constructed considering the information in access log. \nBesides, data evolution is realized according to user \nfeedback. \n1 interference of unrelated data, the \nuser’s interests are mined by access log analyzing. Take \nvisits to the website of materials as an example, the user \nmust be interested in ‘ferrous material’ if most visits were nmade to ‘ferrous node’. In such a case more ferrous material \nand related information would be recommended to him. \nThat’s part of the personalized service we provided in VDS.\nAccess log records the behaviors of the users for every \nvisit. In VDS, ID, IP, URL and visit time are recorded. Table \nI shows the detail explanations of each item. \nRelevant information would be recommended to the user \nbased on access log analyzing. As shown in Fig.6,\ninformation recommendation cons ists of pre-processing, \nsimilarity computing record discovery and ontology creating. \nNote that pre-processing refers to the process of \ninformation extraction from access log. The concept which \nthe user is interested in was extracted from the access log nThen similarity between domain ontology concepts and \ninterest concepts is computed. The concept pair whose nsimilarity value is greater than the threshold is adopted to \ngenerate interest ontology. Similarity computing is based on \n\(1 Discovory\nInterest Ontology\nFigure 7.

Data and services are provided to the \nusers and user feedbacks are accepted at the same time. User nfeedback process is shown in Fig.7. \nIV. APPLICATION CASE\nConsidering the application requirement of material nscientific domain, we developed VDS-based material \nscientific data sharing platform. The platform has integrated \nmassive, heterogeneous and diverse data from more than 30 \ndistributed organizations. Unified data sharing service and \nflexible services is constructed on that basis. Below we’ll \ndiscuss the material scholar assistant as an application case. \nRegistration Information\nAccess Log\nInitial Interest Ontology\nFigure 9 Initialization of Interest Ontoloy. \nPaper Recommendation\nUser Feedback\nUser Feedback\nMaterial Recommendation\nService Recommendation\nFigure 10. Data Evolution. \nMaterial scientists need to look for desired materials in  \nthe ocean of data as soon as possible. For an architect, he \nmay be interested in building materials and organic materials. \nA domain knowledge base should be constructed at first by \nintegrating massive, distributed, heterogeneous and diverse \ndata to ontologies. On that basis, a user-centered material nscholar assistant service is completed according to access log \nand user feedback analyzing.  \nFirstly, the information provided while registering is \ncollected and formed an interest ontology, as shown in Fig.8. \nThen related data and services are recommended to the \nuser based on the interest ontology. Finally, evaluations of nthe recommended data are adopted as the foundation of data \nevolution in VDS, as shown in Fig.9. \nV CONCLUSION\nDataspace management system is increasingly attracting \nattention as an area of study. The VDS proposal is for big \ndata management in science doma in. Firstly, local ontologies \nare created from data sources. Secondly, the local ontologies \nare mapped and formed a global ontology. Based on this, \naccess log and user feedback are considered for data \nevolution. At last, a material scientists -oriented service n\(material scholar mate effectiveness of \nVDS for data management in material domain. In addition, \nour work will be developed further in the future: more \noptimizations will be taken on VDS model and the \nalgorithms for better personalized service. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe work in this paper is supported by the R&D \nInfrastructure and Facility Development Program under \nGrant No. 2005DKA32800, the 2012 Ladder Plan Project of \nBeijing Key Laboratory of Knowledge Engineering for \n4\nMaterials Science under Grant No. Z121101002812005, the \nKey Science-Technology Plan of the National 'Twelfth Five-\nYear-Plan' of China under Grant No.2011BAK08B04, and \nthe National Key

ndelivering a huge volume of bandwidth to all the viewers. \n9. CONCLUSION \nCloud-computing was integral to our success. Not only did \nwe successfully deliver live coverage of a critical scientific \nevent to over one hundred thousand people, we are able to \nbuild confidence about cloud technologies within our \nagency. Using cloud technologies, we were able to rapidly \ndesign, prototype, implement, and test a highly scalable \nservice with virtually no existing infrastructure. Our \nexperience using cloud-computing solutions during the \nMSL landing event proved to us and others that cloud­\ncomputing is mature enough to handle mission critical napplications where failure is not an option. Going forward \nwe hope to integrate cloud-based solutions into many of the \nmissions at NASA, knowing that it will simultaneously save \ncost and improve reliability and performance of mission \ncritical applications. \n10.

nApplications \(TOSCA  deploy, manage, and monitor their \napplications on any PaaS platform. Also, it allows the \ndevelopers to migrate their applications between the \nheterogeneous PaaS platforms. CAMP allows the developers to \n n9 www.vmware.com/\nspecify their applications through Platform Deployment \nPackage \(PDP application. This PDP can be \nused later to migrate the application from one PaaS platform to \nanother. \nTOSCA 21] aims to provide a grammar to help the \ndevelopers to describe the PaaS applications through topology \nand orchestration. Topology is used to define the structure of \nthe application's services while orchestration is used to define \nhow to manage these services. TOSCA represents an \napplication as a set of nodes where each node has a set of \nrequirements and provides a set of capabilities that can be\nneeded by another node Therefore, the relationships between \nnodes should be defined. TOSCA provides Cloud Service \nARchive \(CSAR for each application. CSAR contains all the \ndata \(e.g., source archive and manifest nand manage the application on a specific PaaS platform. The \nmain problem with TOSCA and CAMP is that they are still \nunder the development and may require more modifications. It \nis noted that besides the PADM of COAPS API is based on \nOCCI standards, it follows the same structure of TOSCA and \nCAMP to describe the PaaS applications [8].

process the JSON data into an intermediary\ndata format or do any processing on the message itself.\nMongoDB however must convert the data to BSON, a bi-\nnary based implementation of JSON. This first requires parsing\nthe JSON into Ruby’s native hash structure and from there\nconverting it to BSON data. JSON parsing would be required\nin any application performing this task and so as a real world\ntest, it is fair to include this load during MongoDB’s tests.\nThe YAJL C library is used in these tests which is currently\nconsidered to be one of the most efficient implementations\navailable. The Ruby MongoDB driver is also using the native\nC BSON driver, so the use of Ruby is not unfairly affecting\nthe results.\nHowever to determine whether the performance issues are\nin the JSON library, an additional test was done where the data\nwas converted to a hash only once. This hash was then passed\nto the MongoDB driver. This was repeated for both document\nsizes and get the results in table V and VI for both the 1KB\nand 3KB tests respectively.\nTABLE V. TIME TAKEN TO INSERT 1KB DOCUMENTS INTO\nMONGODB PRE-HASHED\nNumber of inserts 1,000 64,000 256,000\nAverage time taken \(seconds 4.79 19.12\nThroughput \(inserts per second TO INSERT 3KB DOCUMENTS INTO\nMONGODB PRE-HASHED\nNumber of inserts 1,000 64,000 256,000\nAverage time taken seconds inserts per second tests demonstrate that a significant amount of the\ntime is being spent parsing the JSON to a Ruby hash With\nthe 1KB documents, performance increased by approximately\n38.4% and by 52.6% for the 3KB documents. This suggests\nthat as the complexity and size of the document increases,\nthe time required to parse it also increases. However despite\nremoving the JSON parsing from the test, CakeDB remained\n5.4 times faster in the 1KB test and 5.5 times faster in the\n3KB test.\nD. Conclusions\nThe initial tests with both 1KB and 3KB documents\nshowed that CakeDB has better throughput for handling in-\nserts. This is due to its low impact client, streaming inserts\nand latched insert handling on the database itself. The results\ndemonstrate that a specialized database can out perform a\ngeneral purpose database and that CakeDB has significant\nperformance benefits over MongoDB. Additional tests showed\nthat even with pre-hashed datasets and using bulk inserts,\nMongoDB was not able to approach the performance offered\n63\nby CakeDB. This suggests that the performance difference is\nnot simply due to external overhead \(such as JSON parsing in industry there are numerous workloads that do\nnot lend themselves well to a ‘scale out’ approach. This paper\nproposed a disk based approach for storing and then retrieving\nsequential data. By using disk rather than RAM as the main\nform of storage, this approach is able to store significantly\nmore data on a given machine.\nXV. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nCurrently CakeDB only supports simple time range based\nqueries. This works well for reporting, but limits its applica-\nbility to more general use cases. To address this, support is\nbeing added for BSON \(Binary JSON allow for\nricher and more precise queries.\nAlthough CakeDB did not initially focus on read perfor-\nmance, in general usage, read performance was significantly\nbetter than expected. Further research will be undertaken to\ndetermine whether or not such an approach could yield similar\nread performance to current systems \(such as MongoDB Data\nraises questions as to how value can or should be defined.\nIt could be said that the value of data consists of both\nintrinsic and extrinsic value. Further research will be conducted\nto see whether pricing algorithms \(such as those used in\npricing financial derivatives value\nbenchmark.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R. Kallman, H. Kimura, J. Natkins, A.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6.

CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
