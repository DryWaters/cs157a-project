INTRODUCTION \nThe hidden Markov model HMM then widely used in pattern \nrecognition, such as speech, handwriting and gesture \nrecognition.  We can build more 'memory' into states by using \na high-order Markov model. However, the number of \nparameters we need to estimated grows exponentially with the \norder. These models have serveral limitations, such as \nincreasing the state space complexity and being even worse \nprediction accuracy. These problems motivate the study of nparsimonious model. \nIn order to reduce the computational complexity, Raftery \n[1] introduced a parsimonious model: the mixture transition \ndistribution \(MTD the prediction of the current observation \nis considered separately, and it was used to approximate high-\norder Markov model with far lower dimension of parameter \nspace. In this model the number of parameters increases \nlinearly with respect to its order. Due to the parsimonious \nstructure, the MTD model has been applied to many areas. \nRaftery [2] also introduced a relaxed structure by using a \ndifferent transition matrix for each lag. We called it gMTD \nmodel. Raftery et al. [3] reduced the number of constraints and nproposed a computational method for the maximum likelihood \nfunction. They also gave a method for the minimization of 2? . \nBut these methods are not freely available. Berchtold [4] \nproposed an iteratively numerical method for parameters \nestimation. A review of MTD model was given in [5]. Sophie \net al. [7 combined a hidden process with the MTD, and used \nthe expectation-maximization \(EM nparameters. Based on the work [7], Francesco et al. [8] \nproposed a generalized model [8], namely, HM-gMTD model,  \nin which the latent process follows a first-order Markov chain.  \nAlthough the above models ultilized the MTD in the \nhidden Markov model, the algorithms for parameter \nestimation do not guarantee convergence Moreover the EM \nalgorithm has some problems in practical applications. For \nexample, the forward variable  gt? [11] maybe tends to 0 \nexponentially with the increasing of the observable sequence \nlength. To deal with those problems, this paper presents a \nmore perfect model including all general MTD models. \nNumberical example is given to demonstrate that our \ngeneralized model has better prediction power than the MTD \nmodel and some its generalized models. \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In \nSection II, we give an outline of previous studies about the \ndevelopments of the high-order Markov model. An farther nextension about HM-gMTD model is presented in Section III. \nIn Section IV, we proposed a numerical example upon \nimpulsive noise which given to show the predictive ability of \nour model.  Finally, the conclusion are drawn in Section V. \nII.      A  REVIEW  ON  PREVIOUS  RESEARCH \nIn this section, we give a brief review on the development \nof Markov models, including the Markov model, MTD model \n[1] and HM-gMTD model [8]. \nA Markov  Model \nLet tX  be a discrete-time random variable taking value in \nthe finite set },{1,2,= mM  .

We consider the MTD \nmodel of the form  \n n0\n1=\n110 igig\nk\ng\ntkktt qiXiXiXP ???   \(4 transition matrix \nQ , and the lag parameters kgg ??  are non-negtive \nreal numbers, where meet the constraint 1=\n1= g\nk\ng\n?\n\n. \nObviously, a k th-order MTD model only has 11 kmm  \nindependent parameters, which grow linearly with the order \nk . The creative improvement can reduce the number of nparameters    and improve the precision of the prediction as \nwell. Raftery[1] also showed that the limit theorem of MTD \nmodel and the autocorrelation structure of bivariate \ndistribution.  \nBecause of the connection between each lag and the present \nwas denoted by the same one transition matrix Q  in MTD \nmodel Raftery[2] relaxed this assumption by using a different \ntransition matrix n0\ng\nigig\nqQ  for each lag  kgg  , \nand named it gMTD model. Subsequently Berchtold[6,7] also \nexpanded this opinion.  \nC?The combination  of  HMM  and  MTD  model \nTo make use of EM algorithm[11] reasonably, Sophie et \nal.[7] used EM algorithm to estimate the MTD model, and \nthen given us the space of parameter estimation.

Although \nthe EM algorithm guarantees to obtain a local maximum of the \nlikelihood, the results are the most close to the optimum \nsolutions. In order to maximize the chance of approaching the \nglobal maximum, we should start the algorithm from the \ninitial values. By means of the statistical analysis, knowing \nthat, it has the advantages of using the maximum likelihood \nestimation of its nested models. \nIV. NUMERICAL  EXAMPLE \n Comparing our model with its nest models, we use the \nBayesian information criterion \(BIC  As a \nreliable model selection criteria, BIC was applied to Markov \nchain in 1981. It is defined as  \n  2 TqlogBIC +? ?  \(33 stands for the log-likelihood of the model, q  is \nthe number of independent parameters, and T  is the number \nof data points. The model achieving the lowest BIC value is \nchosen. \nIn recent years, the power line communication \(PLC  mode \nwhich applied to the existing power grid and energy \nmanagement system to convey data, speech and images etc. \nHowever, there are many factors to influence the reliability of \n512\nPLC. While the most serious influence is impulse noise. \nAlthough some scholars have studied the impulse noise \nmodeling, and achived some 


results. For example, Manfred et \nal.[16] introduced a model for the time behavior of impulsive \nnoise using Markov chain. But this model just determines \nwhether exist any impulse noises, so ignoring the  relationship namong the impulse noise amplitudes. By comparing the \ntraditional Markov model, we found that the gMTDHM ?2 nmodel retains more characteristics of impulse noise amplitude, \nwhich makes it more consistent to the fact. \n Now we measure twenty groups impulse noise in PLC \nchannel. Fig.3 shows one group measured amplitude nsequences of power line’s impulse noise. For the amplitude \ncharacteristics of impulse noise in PLC, we apply the \ngMTDHM ?2  model and its nest models to a series of the \nimpulse noise respectively. We consider the 20 groups time \nseries of length 5000 as a discrete sequence separately,  \nremoving the influence of interval duration, and symbols etc, \nsuch as Fig.4. Depending on the size of amplitude, these \ndiscrete sequences were divided into five states.   \n \n \nFig.3.   The sequence of one group Impulse noise modeling of PLC \n \n \nFig.4 The discretization of impulse noise \(m=5 as the changing trends of observations over time, \nwhich include 'up' and 'down'. Let 1 stands for 'up' and stands \n2 for 'down'. So the initial probabilities vector ?  is  \n},{= 21 ???  \nwhere \n1,2 3 iiSPi nAll the results are summarized in Table 2, where MC1 \nstands for the first-order Markov chain, MC2 stands for nsecond-order Markov chain.  \n \nTABLE II.  COMPARISON BETWEEN THE MODELS IN TABLE 1 BY \nMODELING OF POWER LINE IMPULSE NOISE \nModel Number of parameters 21 -19950 4.4380e+004\nHM?gMTD 43 -56643 9.2431e+004\ngMTDHM ?2 47 -6980.2 1.2785e+004\n \nIt can be seen that the BIC of gMTDHM ?2  model is \nminimum. Based on the number of parameters of HM-gMTD \nand gMTDHM ?2  model are little difference, the BIC of \ngMTDHM ?2  model is far less than HM-gMTD model. \nSimilarly, the second-order Markov model has more than two \ntimes parameters than gMTDHM ?2  model, but the BIC of \nsecond-order Markov model is four times the gMTDHM ?2  \nmodel. So Table II realizes the gMTDHM ?2  model has a \nbetter result than its nest models. \nIt can be discovered that the two different trends of the \nimpulse noise is governed by some strong rules, such as if \n1> ?tt XX , then the probability of tt XX <1+  less than the \nprobability of tt XX 1+  obviously. Similarly if 1< ?tt XX , then \nthe probability of tt XX >1+  less than the probability of \ntt XX <1+  apparently. What's more, the probability which from \nthe high amplitude to the high amplitude is less than the \nprobability that from the high amplitude to the low amplitude. \nFrom the above, the gMTDHM ?2  model has already \nshowed its advantages in this paper. To further demonstrate \nthe advantages of our model , we can also attempt to use it in \nother areas, such as financial industry, signal prediction and \nspeech prediction ect.  \nV.    COLCLUSIONS \nIn this paper we have proposed a new Markov model with \nhigh-order hidden process and MTD model. We have shown \nthat, by assuming that the latent process follows a second-\norder Markov chain the class of high-order Markov models \ncan be generalized in an advisable way. This combination \ngeneralizes not only the MTD model, but also the HMM. To \nreduce some unnecessary errors, we use the scaling procedure \nin the process of parameter estimation. Moreover, an \napplication using an impulsive noise sequence shows that the \ngeneralization can lead to better results than its nest models.  \n \n513\nACKNOWLEDGMENT  \nThis work is supported by the Fundamental Research \nFunds for the Central Universities, No. ZYGX2010J111, No nZYGX2011J102, and Yunnan Provincial Natural Science \nFoundation of China under Grant No. 2011FZ025.      \n \n nREFERENCES \n[1] A.E.Raftery, A model for high-order Markov chains,  J.

between the MSL flight computer and the Electra-\nLite UHF Transceiver that resulted in constraints on nallowable command data product size and development of a \ncomplex buffer management system to avoid truncating \ndownlink frames.  While operational workarounds were \nultimately identified, these idiosyncrasies resulted in more \ncomplex ground processes and delayed other critical relay \ntests.  Future missions should ensure early and thorough \ndocumentation and validation of the end-to-end relay data \npath. \nVerification Validation \(V&V including during the cruise phase of the mission.  \nWhile these were addressed prior to arrival at Mars, and nactual surface operations have proceeded smoothly, it would \nhave been desirable to identify these issues earlier.  The \nchallenge here, which is common to the previous \nexperiences with MER and PHX, is that the testing timeline \nis dictated by the lander mission’s V&V test program and \ntestbed accessibility.  The Mars Exploration Program may \nneed to establish more formal guidelines for the scope and \nschedule of testing related to verification and validation of \nrelay services, and ensure that all missions develop their test nschedules and corresponding resource profiles to meet those \nguidelines. \nEnd-to-End Relay Testbeds:  The fidelity of the end-to-end \ntestbeds for relay system testing can play a significant role \nin the overall success of the V&V test campaign.  For the \nMSL-MRO link, both the orbiter and lander projects had \nhigh fidelity spacecraft testbeds resident at JPL, with \nEngineering Models of the Electra and Electra-Lite ntransceivers, and with flight-like representations of the \nspacecraft Command & Data Handling \(C&DH subsystem.  \nWhile these testbeds were located at separate sites within \nthe JPL campus, fiber optic links supported signal flow \nbetween them, as well as integration of a high-fidelity link \nchannel simulator capable of emulating realistic time \nvariation of link amplitude, frequency, and delay, enabling \nthorough end-to-end data flow testing over a range of flight-\nlike signal conditions.  For ODY and MEX, however, each \norbiter project had only a portable test set available at JPL to \nsupport cross-project testing with MSL, each with a flight-\nlike UHF transceiver but with lower fidelity representations \nof the orbiter C&DH.  This limited the scope of ground \ntesting possible on the MSL-ODY and MSL-MEX links.  \nThis, combined with some non-flight-like aspects of the \nODY test set that were discovered late in the V&V test \ncampaign, resulted in the deferral of full validation and use \nof the MSL-ODY forward link capability until well after \nlanding.  The conclusions here are that high-fidelity testbeds \nincrease the robustness of end-to-end relay testing; when \nprogrammatic considerations limit the test hardware fidelity, \nit is essential to clearly document and assess any non-flight-\nlike aspects of the testbed infrastructure. \nElectromagnetic Interference:  Uncertainty in the MRO nEMI environment resulted in significant concern prior to \nMSL arrival as to whether Curiosity would be able to \nachieve the desired 250 Mb/sol data return via the MRO \nrelay path.  This resulted in a large amount of MRO flight \nand ground testing to attempt to better quantify the EMI \nimpacts as a function of Electra return link frequency.  It \nalso drove the need for a lengthy commissioning phase \nduring the first few months of MSL surface operations, to \ncarefully monitor performance as each MRO science \ninstrument was powered on Electra’s frequency-agility \nturned out to be an important tool in mitigating the EMI \nimpacts.  In hindsight earlier and more thorough flight \ntesting could have provided more confidence in the \npredicted MRO relay performance; however, such testing \nwould have required interruption of ongoing MRO science \nobservations Ultimately, future missions will want to \naddress EMI issues earlier in the spacecraft/instrument \ndevelopment cycle to identify and mitigate any spurious \nemissions prior to launch. \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nNASA’s ODY and MRO orbiters and ESA’s MEX orbiter \nembody an international network of Mars relay orbiters, \nproviding essential telecommunication services to the Mars \nScience Laboratory mission.  All three orbiters provided ncomplementary coverage of MSL’s EDL, acquiring tracking \nand telemetry data from MSL’s UHF transmission that ncould have provided essential information for fault \nreconstruction had a mission-ending anomaly occurred nduring EDL.  Since landing, ODY and MRO are providing \nthe highest levels of data return yet achieved for a Mars \nlander, with over 45 Gb of Curiosity data returned over the \nfirst 90 sols of the surface mission.  Key to this level of \nperformance are a number of new capabilities in the Electra \nand Electra-Lite UHF Transceivers on MRO and MSL, \nrespectively, including higher data rates, frequency-agile \noperations, and adaptive data rates, as well as the dedication \nof the operations teams on each mission and the MaROS nmultimission relay operations tools and processes \nsupporting them. \n \n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 11 \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe research described in this paper was carried out at the \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of \nTechnology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration. \nREFERENCES  \n [1] Charles D.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
