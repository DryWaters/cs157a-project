To achieve this, the output power of \ndiversely located identical \(having the same power rating and \nsmall PV plants instead of a big PV plant in a certain area, is \nintegrated.

This small power fluctuation is \nreduced by small energy storage device. This way the size of the nenergy storage can be reduced considerably. Practical irradiance \ndata was measured and then PV power was estimated from these \nirradiance data. After the integration of the output power of \ndiversely located PV plants in common point, still there may be \nsmall fluctuation. In order to remove this small fluctuation, a nsmall capacity energy storage system is proposed. The energy \nstorage needed for the diversely located PV system and the \nequivalent big plant in a particular area are investigated and \ncompared to each other. Also it is shown that the size of the \nenergy storage required for the diversely located PV system is \nsmaller than that for a big PV plant.  \nKeywords— Energy storage, irradiance, photovoltaic \(PV spatially dispersed PV plant, variability of \nirradiance. \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \nAs conventional sources of energy are rapidly depleting and \nthe cost of energy is rising, renewable energy becomes a \npromising alternative source [1]. It is estimated that current \nglobal petroleum resources could be used up within 50 years if \nthey are consumed at present consumption rates [2]. Moreover, \nenergy generated from this fossil fuel based sources releases \nbillions of metric tons of carbon in the form of CO2, one of the \nprimary greenhouse gases capable of producing profound \nclimate change. Such a carbon based economy is not only nunsustainable, but also vulnerable. The need to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions due to fossil fuels and the nliberalization of the electricity market have led to large scale \ndevelopment of renewable energy generators in electric grids \n[3]. \nRenewable energy sources, like photovoltaic \(PV attention due to their \nsustainability and their minimum impact on the environment. \nThese energy sources neither produce waste nor pollute air and \nthey are omnipresent. So they can be used as diverse power ngenerator to replace primary fossil fuel based energy sources. \nAlthough the renewable energy sources have these desirable \ncharacteristics, they are time varying and produce variable \noutput. The solar irradiance variability is perceived as a \nroadblock to the large scale deployment of solar power \ngeneration [4]. Their intermittent power production is called \nthe “intermittency problem”. The intermittency problem of \nsolar energy is that solar panels cannot produce power steadily \nbecause their power production rates change with seasons, \nmonth, days, hours, etc. [5]. The output variability of PV \nsources also stems from the fact that these systems are static, \nand thus, any instantaneous change in the irradiance reaching \nthe PV arrays leads to corresponding change in their output \npower [6].  \nThe variability of the solar power is major concerns to nintegrate PV power to the grid. Currently, PV systems are \nallowed to inject all their generated power into the grid unless \nany of the operating limits of the network is violated [6]. In \nthese cases, the utility might request the system owner to take \nremedial steps to smooth the output of the PV system or to \nrestrict the generation of the PV system to a certain limit [6]. \nResearch to determine the effects of variable solar ninsolation on solar PV output and its potential impacts on grid \noperations began in the 1980s [7]. Most of these studies are \nbased on scaling PV data from single site or simple cloud \nmodels; in general, these studies fail to account for the \nsmoothing effect expected from aggregating multiple sites or \nintra-system smoothing occurring in utility-scale solar \ngeneration scale [8]. On the other hand, multiple studies ndemonstrate a significant decrease in aggregate solar PV \noutput variability from systems at varying levels of spacing \n[7]. The authors build on this relationship and present methods \nfor estimating aggregate system variability from the variability \nof a single system [7]. Both papers state that, for a fleet of \nindependent i.e. uncorrelated of \nsystems will approximate \nN1\n of the variability of a single \nsite, where N equals the number of sites 7]. Although, these \nworks were able to show that reduction of the variability is \npossible after aggregation, still there is variation of power. The \nexisting variability of power will cause the deterioration of \nM. K. Hossain & M. H.

Our focus of this \nparticular work is to propose a methodology to mitigate that \nstill 


existing variability in power with the help of small battery \nenergy storage system. Again the battery energy storage \nsystem is used for removing the PV power variability [6]. In \nthose works since only BEES was used as buffer, the capacity \nof the BEES required is high.  But in this work we’ll see that \nafter the integration of PV power the energy storage size is \nconsiderably reduced. Elimination of massive storage device \nhas several advantages: maintenance and replacing cost will \nbe reduced; the cost for BEES can be used for setup extra nsolar cell in the system. \nTherefore, the focus of this paper is to mitigate the PV \npower fluctuation of spatially diverged PV plant to improve the \npower quality prior to the integration to the grid with small nbattery energy storage system. Elimination of massive storage \ncapacities in emerging electricity grid with reduction of power \nfluctuation is also another major goal of this paper. \nII. PV SYSTEM UNDER STUDY \n \n \n \n \n n \n \n \n \nFig. 1.  Grid connected spatially diverged PV plants. \nFig. 1 represents spatially dispersed PV system connected \nto the grid. Only four PV plants are showed there. But, number \nof PV plants may be ten twenty or even more. PCU blocks \nrepresent the power controlling unit and the function of this \nunit is to control the DC power generated from the PV plant \nand to convert the DC power into ac power.  PPV is the ac npower from the diversely located PV plants, whereas PS and PG \nare the power from/to the storage and power to the grid, \nrespectively. The role of the storage device in Fig. 1 is to \nfurther smooth the output power of PV system. The storage \ndevice should have a response time that matches the speed of \nthe fluctuations and should be able to deliver the energy over \nthe range of few minutes to few hours [6]. In this proposed \nsystem, DC transmission loss is neglected at the time of \nintegration in a particular point since we are considering a nsmall area. Since the proposed method uses DC transmission \nfor PV power integration the voltage drop will be low compare \nto the ac transmission voltage drop. The voltage drop for DC \ntransmission line VD= IR*cos whereas for AC transmission \nline VD= I\(R*cos?+X*sin in DC transmission is lower than AC \ntransmission. \nIII. EXPERIMENTAL DATA ANALYSIS \nA. Data Collection \nThe irradiance data for this work was collected from \nsynchronized measuring instruments \(Payranometer nthe top of the different buildings surrounding the South Dakota \nState University, USA. The measuring terminals cover an area \nof 3km\n2\n. Each terminal is equipped with a pyranometer and a \nsystem for data acquisition to transmit the data to the control \npoint. The irradiance measurement for each terminal was done nin a synchronized step. The irradiance data measured at 10 min \ninterval and these data were transmitted to the laboratory \nduring the night. We installed maximum twenty measuring \nterminals. Then we considered 5, 10 and 20 measuring stations \nrespectively to see the smoothing effect. \nB. Estimation of Irradiance Fluctuation nFor estimation of irradiance fluctuation, we need to set \nbase components and then measured irradiance data are \nsubtracted from the base components to extract fluctuation \ncomponents. The main purpose of extracting the fluctuation \ncomponents is to show the solar irradiance variability. The \nquantification of irradiance data also shows here the \ncomparison between one station and multiple stations solar \nirradiance variability The base components were assumed to \nbe the moving averages of \(2k+1 an integer. The following equation was used to \nestimate the irradiance fluctuation [9]: \n     \n n12\n1\n   n?\n?? ?\n?\n??\ntM\nk\ntMtF\nkt\nkt iii\n                  \(1 tFi\n is fluctuant irradiance at ith station,  \n tM i\n is \nthe measured irradiance at ith station, \nt\n is time in minute, \n?\nthe time lag and the k the degree of moving average.  \nFig. 2 represents an example of extracting the fluctuation \ncomponents. In Fig. 2 it is seen that irradiance fluctuation is \nless when the irradiance of 20 stations are integrated together. \nBut, fluctuation is high for one station only. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2.

Irradiance plot for diversely located PV station, \(a b c 12, \(d e f a n\(b c a n\(b c nC. Irradiance Data Analysis \nFigs. 3\(a-f Figs. it is clear that the solar irradiance is \nrandom in nature. Here, we assumed a PV system of 20 ndiversely located PV stations and in Figs. 3\(a-f presented. If the \nsmall PV stations are located spatially diverged instead of a \nbig equivalent PV power plant in one point, then after adding  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe irradiance data collected from different stations smoother \nirradiance curve can be obtained. The reason is that, at a \nparticular time one PV station might be partially blocked by \ncloud and the other remotely located station may not have any \ncloud effect at 


that time, then one plant compensates another \nPV plant’s irradiance deficiency. \nIn Fig. 4 it is shown that averaging the irradiance data of \nmultiple spatially dispersed PV plants does in fact reduce the \nvariability of the solar irradiance and leads to a smooth \nirradiance curve. In Fig. 4\(a and \ntheir average are plotted together. The average irradiance \ncurve of five stations still has some fluctuation. But in Figs. \n4\(b c plotted respectively, and it is seen that as the \nnumber of stations are increased the average irradiance nfluctuations are reduced. The bold blue lines are the average \nirradiance data in Fig. 4 and it is seen that 20 stations data can \nproduce smoother curve than 10 and 5 stations data. The idea \nof averaging the irradiance data for spatially dispersed PV \nstation is helpful for understanding the smoothing effect. Since nPV power varies with solar irradiance, this smoothing effect is \nalso applicable to output PV for spatially dispersed PV plants. \nIV. CONVERSION OF IRRADIANCE DATA TO PV POWER \nThe PV effect is a basic physical process through which \nsolar energy is converted directly into electrical energy [5]. \nThe performance of PV modules is a function of the physical \nvariables of the PV cell material, the solar cell temperature \nand the solar radiation incident on the PV modules [10]. Using \nthe measured solar radiation at different stations and the nmanufacturers data for the PV modules as model inputs, the \npower output of the PV generator, Ppv\(t calculated \naccording to the following equation [11]: \n \n                      \npvPV AEfftInstP  n 2 t at time t \(W/m\n2\n m\n2\n panels and the DC/DC converter.

Fig. 5 represents the smoothing effect. It \nis shown in Fig. 5\(b has some \nfluctuation. But, when ten stations are integrated together the \nfluctuations are less as compared with the previous five PV \nintegrated system. Thus, the power in Fig. 5\(d in Fig. 5\(b power in terms of less fluctuation. The integrated PV \npower from 20 spatially dispersed PV stations is shown in Fig. \n5\(f e cumulative power for the 20 \nPV stations has still some fluctuation we want to remove that \nsmall fluctuation Since the power quality is influenced by still \nexisting power fluctuation, we proposed a method for reducing nthe still existing power fluctuation with the help of energy \nstorage system.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\(b n \n \n\(d f perform some tasks for PV \npower application like bridge power fluctuation; shift the peak \ngeneration period and outage protection [5]. Adopting a \nstrategy of smoothing the fluctuating PV power by \naggregating and then further smoothing by small scale energy \nstorage will make the PV power direct dispatchable to the \ngrid. Due to direct dispatch to the grid there is no need for \nstoring the energy at large-scale and this will reduce the \nsystem cost, since there is no need for large-scale energy \nstorage.  This section investigates the use of energy storage \nsystem with spatially dispersed PV stations.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 6.

The energy storage system is connected to the system \nat the point of common coupling and is charged/discharged \nthrough a power converter to smooth the net power to be \ninjected to the grid.  \nA. Comparison of Energy Storage Needed for Diversely \nLocated PV System and an Equivalent Big Plant      \n     For smoothing purpose we need energy storage, and here \nwe can make a comparison between the energy storage needed \nfor a big PV station at one place and the other PV system that \nconsists of spatially dispersed small PV plants. It is assumed \nthat both power stations have the same capacity. For making \ncomparison, a reference is needed. In this case, the time naverage of solar power output Psolar of spatially dispersed PV \nplant can be used as the reference power. \n nsolarreference PP ?\n                                     \(3 the moving average at time period T and it \ncan be determined by the following equation [12].         \n n??\n?\n?\ndPP\nt\nsolarsolar ? ??\n1\n                                  \(4 average is used for the modified Euler \ntype of moving average [12]. \nThe energy storage device should have the capacity to \nabsorb the difference and estimating the capacity of the energy \nstorage device is important Fig.  7\(b stations and this power will be the power absorbed by \nenergy storage. We can consider the positive power of the Fig. \n7\(b a b nFig. 7.  \(a reference power b in watts plant in a particular area then \nwe will see high power fluctuation. Fig. 8\(a for a big PV station equivalent to spatially \ndispersed 20 PV plants and the reference power together and nFig. 8\(b reduce the \npower fluctuation with energy storage, then the size of the \nenergy storage will be big for one big PV plant. On the other \nhand, for 20 spatially dispersed PV systems, the aggregated \npower has small fluctuation. Therefore, in order to smooth out \nthis small fluctuation we need small capacity energy storage nWe can also determine the size of the energy storage \ndevice for smoothing purpose of PV power in case of both 20 \nspatially dispersed PV systems and a big PV plant equivalent \nto spatially dispersed 20 PV plants The maximum size of the \nstorage device is determined by integrating the charging and \ndischarging power in a particular period of time. We’ve got \nabout 35 kw of maximum capacity for particular area of the \nPV plant and then we’ve calculated the size of the energy \nstorage needed to smooth out the power fluctuations for both ncases, i.e., spatially dispersed PV systems and an equivalent \nbig PV plant. For spatially dispersed PV system we’ve got a \nmaximum size of 52kwh energy storage. On the other hand, \nfor same capacity of big plant the maximum size of the energy \nstorage is 126.83kwh, which is greater than twice the size of \nthe energy storage required to smooth out PV power \nfluctuation in case of spatially dispersed PV system. Fig. 9 nrepresents the energy storage required to smooth out PV \npower fluctuation in case of  spatially diverged PV plant and a \nbig PV plant having capacity the same as the spatially \ndiverged PV plant for existing sunlight period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\(a b a b Psolar in case of \nbig PV plant \(in watts 24\n0\n5,00\n10,000\n15,000\n20,000\n25,000\n30,800\nTime\(hour W\n 24\n-6000\n-5000\n-4000\n-300\n-2000\n-1\n0\n1\n2000\n3\n4000\nTime\(hour W\n 24\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\nx 10\n4\nTime\(hour nW 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24\n-4000\n-3000\n-2000\n-1000\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\nTime\(hour fl\nuc\ntua\ntio\nn\(W\n a b power \(a b PV plant. \n \nIt is shown that the proposed method filters small \nfluctuations. Furthermore, the BESS charge/discharge \nfrequency is relatively high in this application, and hence, the \nconventional lead acid batteries or nickel cadmium batteries \nwith life cycles of less than thousands or a few thousands will \nnot be suitable and new type of batteries with high \ncharge/discharge cycling rates, such as flow batteries, sodium nsulfur batteries, or lithium ion batteries [13], would be suitable \nfor this application. \nVI. CONCLUSION nThis paper deals with the smoothing of PV power \nfluctuation of spatially diverged PV plant with small energy nstorage in order to directly dispatch power to the grid. The \nreduction of power fluctuation in cumulative power of \ndiversely located PV system is demonstrated. The energy \nstorage needed for the diversely located PV system and the \nequivalent big plant in a particular area are investigated and \ncompared to each other. Based 


on results, the following points \nare noteworthy. \na nlocated PV plant is possible by the proposed method.  \nb ndiversely located PV system is smaller than that for a big PV \nplant. \nIn this work, we estimated the capacity of the PV plant \nconsidering the particular area of the plant and then we \ndetermined the maximum size of the energy storage required \nto smooth out the PV power. If the size of the PV plant is \nvaried, then the energy storage required for the smoothing \npurpose will also vary accordingly. \nVII. REFERENCES \n[1] C Hua, J. Lin, and C.

The extra logs contain\nevent sequences indicating the process of error message and\nfault recovery. Therefore, dierent event sequences, which\nreflect dierent system behaviours should be recovered be-\ntween dierent runs of an application with and without fail-\nures. Several approaches that identify the dierent event\nsequences in logs can be used to identify system failures.\n3.4.1 Sequence counts variance\nS que ce cou ts var ance \(SCV multiple runs of the\nsame a plication. It is defined as the ratio of the standard\ndeviation ? to the mean nSCV =\n?\nµ\n\(1 Before running an application\nperiodically on a cloud computing platform, a certain num-\nber of runs of the program without problems are required\nto setup a baseline of the SCV. After deploying the pro-\ngram, any SCV among the number of consecutive runs that\nis larger than the baseline would be considered a warning of\nfailure.\nFor example, if we setup our baseline based on three failure-\nfree runs and recover 8, 9 and 10 log sequences respectively,\nthe baseline SCV would be 0.111. If a following run gen-\nerates 10 log sequences we would calculate the SCV based\non the number 9, 10 and 10 \(number 9 and the first num-\nber 10 are from the previous two runs 0.111 that the new run is failure-free. If another\nrun has failure and generates 15 log sequence, the SCV cal-\nculated by the number 10, 10 and 15 would be 0.247, which\nis larger than the baseline. An alert would be sent to the\nadministrator for further inspection.\n3.4.2 Sequence distribution\nDierent runs of an application with and without failures\nintuitively have dierent sequence distributions. Therefore,\nstatistical methods to detect dierent distributions can be\nused for automatic failure detection. In practice, we have\nbaseline runs for each application without failure, and we\ncarry out an unpaired, 2-sided t-test \(Mann-Whitney the two runs to setup a baseline p-value. The lower\nthe p-value, th higher probability that the new run has\nfailure. Therefore, every new run will be tested with the\nprevious failure-free run to calculate the p-value. A p-value\nthat is larg r than the baseline would indicate failures.\nFor examp e, we start two failure-free baseline run with\nthe sequences distribution of “4, 2, 2” and “4, 3, 2”.

If another run has\nthe sequence distribution of “5, 2, 2”, we perform a t-test\nbetwe 5, 2, 2” and “4, 3, 2” \(the sequence distribution\nof the previous failure-free run is\nlarger th n the baseline \(0.8137 failure has the\nsequence distribution of “6, 5, 2, 2”, the calculated p-value\nwould be 0.6533, which is smaller than the baseline. There-\nfore, the administrator would receive an alert.\nIn the following two sections, we present our three case stud-\nies on a widely used cloud computing platform, and detect\nthree injected problems with the approach presented in this\nsection.\n4. CASE STUDY SETUP\nWe present the cloud computing platform that we chose,\nthe subject programs, the experimental environment and the\ninput data.\n4.1 Cloud computing platform: Hadoop\nThis sub-section introduces Hadoop, a widely used cloud\ncomputing platform that we choose for our case studies. We\nbriefly present the programming model, and the Hadoop log\nthat we use in our case studies.\n4.1.1 Programming model\nHadoop is an open-source cloud computing platform [30]\nthat is supported by Yahoo! and is used by Amazon, AOL\nand a number of other companies as their cloud computing\nplatform. To achieve parallel execution, Hadoop implements\na programming model named MapReduce.\nMapReduce is a distributed divide-and-conquer program-\nming model. The programming model consists of two phases:\na massively parallel“Map”phase, followed by an aggregating\n“Reduce” phase. The input data for MapReduce is broken\ndown into a list of key/value pairs. Mappers \(processes as-\nsigned to the “Map” phase accept the incoming pairs, pro-\ncess them in parallel and generate intermediate key/value\npairs. All intermediate pairs having the same key are then\npassed to a specific Reducer \(process assigned to the Re-\nduce” phase output of\nall Reducers is the final result of a MapReduce run.\nTo illustrate MapReduce, we consider an example MapRe-\nduce process which counts the frequency of word lengths in\nFig. 2. An example of our approach for summarizing the run-time behaviour of BDA Apps.\non full logs to abstract the logs. Figure 2 shows an example\nof a log file with 11 log lines and how we process it. Each log\nline contains the execution time stamp, the ask t pe, and the\ntask ID. The log lines are abstracted into six different system\nevents, as shown in Figure 2-b. The “$id” and “$t” identifiers\nindicate two dynamic values.\n2 dynamic values, such as\n“$id”, to link log lines into a sequence. The linking heuristic is\nbased on the dynamic values. In our example, T skID is used\nfor log linking since TaskID represents some kind of session\n“ID”. Therefore, line 1 and line 3 in the input data in Figure 2-\na can be linked together since they 


contain the same TaskID.\nSimilar to log abstraction, we also identify the linkage among\na few IDs based on a small sample of data, then apply the\nlinking on full data.\nFigure 2-c shows the resulting sequences after abstracting\nthe logs and linking them into sequences using the TaskID\nvalues. Events E1, E2, E3, E5 and E6 are linked together \(note\nthat event E3 has been executed three times together since the same TaskID values\ne shared, among them.\n3 is\nsequence caused by loops. For example, for sequences about\nreading data from a remote node, there would be repeated\nevents about fetching the data. Without this step, similar log\nsequenc s that include different occurrences f the same ev nt\nare considered differ nt sequences, although they indicate the\nsame system behaviour in essence. These repeated events need\nt be suppressed to i prove the readability of the generated\nsummaries. Therefore, we use regular expression techniques to\ndetect and suppress the repetitions For the example sho n in\nFigure 2, our technique detects th repetition of E3 in the\nsequence “E1, E2, E3, E3 E3, E5, E6”, a d reduces this\nsequence to “E1, E2, E3, E5, E6”.\nThe sec nd step of implifying s quences is dealing with\npermutations of seq ences. The reason why permutations oc-\n405\ncur is that sometimes the events execute asynchronously on the\ndistributed computing platforms, although the corresponding\nsequences result in the same system behaviour. We group the\npermutations of a sequence together to simplify the sequences.\nFor example, if we recovered two sequences “E1, E2, E3, E4”\nand “E1, E3, E2, E4”, we would group these two sequences\ntogether in this step.\nAfter simplifying sequences, we obtain the final log se-\nquences in Figure 2-d.\nB. Generating Reports\nWe generate a log sequence report in HTML format. Fig-\nure 3 shows an example report. The report consists of two\nparts: an overview of the number of execution log sequences\nand a list of sample log lines. To ease the comparison of\ndifferent reports, each event is represented by the same unique\nnumber across the reports. An exemplar sequence from the\nanalyzed logs is shown in each row of the report to provide\ndevelopers an actual example with a realistic context.\nV. CASE STUDY\nIn this section, we present the design of the case study that\nwe performed to evaluate our approach.\nA. Subject Applications\nWe use three BDA Apps as subjects for our study. Two out\nof the three applications are chosen to be representative of\nindustrial BDA Apps. In addition, to avoid potential bias from\nthe development of the applications, we chose one application\nthat is developed from scratch and another application that is\nre-engineered by migrating a set of Perl scripts to the Hadoop\nplatform. In addition, to ease the replication of our approach\nby others, we chose a third application from Hadoop’s official\nexample package The overview of the three BDA Apps is\nshown in Table I.\n• WordCount. WordCount is an application that is released\nwith Hadoop as one of the examples of MapReduce\nprogramming. The WordCount application analyzes the\ninput files and counts the number of occurrences of each\nword in the input files.\n• PageRank. PageRank 11] is a program used by the\nGoogle Internet search engine for rating Web pages. We\nimplemented the PageRank algorithm on Hadoop.\n• JACK. JACK is an industrial application that uses data\nmining techniques to identify problems in load tests [12].\nThis tool is used in practice on a daily basis. We migrated\nJACK to the Hadoop platform.\nNote that none of the three above BDA Apps have their\nown logs and the logs that our approach uses are the plat-\nform \(Hadoop Environment Setting\nAs input data for WordCount and JACK, we use two groups\nof execution log files of a large enterprise application. The\ninput data for the PageRank application, however, comes from\nTABLE I\nOVERVIEW OF THE THREE SUBJECT BDA APPS.\nWordCount PageRank JACK\nSource Hadoop: Google: RIM:\nOfficial Developed Migrated\nExample from scratch from Perl\nDomain File Social Log\nprocessing network analysis\nInjected Machine Missing supporting Lack of\nproblem failure library disk space\nTABLE II\nOVERVIEW OF THE BDA APP’S INPUT DATA SIZE.\nWordCount & PageRank\nJACK\nLarge Data 3.69GB 1.08GB\nSmall Data 597MB 10.7MB\ntwo social-network datasets from the Stanford Large Network\nDataset Collection2.

CASE STUDY RESULTS\nIn this section, we present our research questions, and the\nresults of our case study. For each research question, we\npresent the motivation of the question, our approach to answer\nthe question, and the results.\nA. RQ1: How Much Effort Reduction Does Our Approach\nProvide When Verifying the Deployment of BDA APPs in the\nCloud?\nMotivation\nDevelopers often use simple text search techniques to\nidentify troublesome events when deploying BDA Apps. For\nexample, keywords such as “kill” and fail” are often used\nto find problematic tasks in Hadoop. Due to the decision\nby underlying platform \(e.g algorithms that Hadoop uses for\nassigning tasks to machines other reasons than an actual deployment fail-\nure. Two commonly seen examples of such reasons on 


Hadoop\nplatform are “Task exceptions” and “Speculative execution”:\n• Task exceptions. When there is an exception during the\nexecution of a Hadoop task, the task will be killed and\nrestarted on another cloud node Therefore, a keyword\nsearch for “kill” on the log lines would flag such Hadoop\ndecisions as a sign of failure even though this is supposed\nto be transparent from the developer.\n• Speculative execution. The overall performance of a\nHadoop Job may slow down because of some slow-\nrunning tasks. To optimize the performance Hadoop\n2http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ last check Aug, 2012.\n406\nTotal 5 grouped sequences\nCount Grouped Sequence\n105 8, 10, 7, 0, 5, 3, 2, 1\n22 8, 10, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1\n21 10, 0, 5, 3, 2, 1\n2 8, 10, 7, 0, 4, 5 2, 6, 3, 1\n1 8, 10, 4, 0, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1\nshow\t sample\t nsequences\t nTotal 5 grouped sequences\nCount Grouped Sequence\n105\n8, 10, 7, 0, 5, 3, 2, 1\nSample Sequence8#8#8#10#7#0#5#3#2#1\n8\n2011-06-26 15:36:53,460 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobInProgress:\ntip:task_201106261526_0001_m_000047 has split on node:/default-\nrack/sail215.cs.queensu.ca\n8\n2011-06-26 15:36:53,460 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobInProgress:\ntip:task_201106261526_0001_m_000047 has split on node:/default-\nrack/sail217.cs.queensu.ca\n8\n2011-06-26 15:36:53,460 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobInProgress:\ntip:task_201106261526_0001_m_000047 has split on node:/default-\nrack/sail213.cs.queensu.ca\n10\n2011-06-26 15:37:29,100 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker Adding task\n'attempt_201106261526_0001_m_000047_0' to tip task_201106261526_0001_m_000047,\nfor tracker tracker_sail215.cs.queensu.ca:localhost/127.0.0.1:48227'\n7 2011-06-26 15:37:29,100 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobInProgress: Choosing data-local task task_201106261526_0001_m_000047\n0\n2011-06-26 15:37:29,101 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker:\ntracker_sail215.cs.queensu.ca:localhost/127.0.0.1:48227 LaunchTask:\nattempt_201106261526_0001_m_000047_0\n5\n2011-06-26 15:38:10,657 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobInProgress: Task\n'attempt_201106261526_0001_m_000047_0' has completed\ntask_201106261526_0001_m_000047 successfully.\n3\n2011-06-26 15:51:54,749 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker: Marked\n'attempt_201106261526_0001_m_000047_0 from\n'tracker_sail215.cs.queensu.ca:localhost/127.0.0.1:48227'\n2 2011-06-26 15:51:55,758 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker: Removing task'attempt_201106261526_0001_m_000047_0'\n1\n2011-06-26 15:51:55,758 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker: Removed completed\ntask attempt_201106261526_0001_m_000047_0' from\n'tracker_sail215.cs.queensu.ca:localhost/127.0.0.1:48227'\n22 8 10, 7, 0, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1\n21 10, 0, 5, 3, 2, 1\n2 8, 10, 7, 0, 4, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1\n1 8, 10, 4, 0, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1\nFig 3. An example of our log sequences report.\nreplicates the unfinished tasks on idle machines. When\none of the replicated tasks, or the original task, is finished,\nHadoop commits the results from the task and kills other\nreplicas. This mechanism is similar to the Backup Task\nin Google’s MapReduce platform [8]. The replication\nand killing are decided at run-time and are not signs of\ndeployment failures. However, again, a keyword search\nwould flag them as a problem to be verified.\nTherefore, a simple text search for such keywords may result\nin a very large set of irrelevant log lines for manual verifi-\ncation. In this research question we investigate whether our\napproach saves any effort in the cloud deployment verification\nprocess.\nApproach\nTo evaluate our approach in terms of effort reduction, we\nuse the amount of log lines that must be examined as a\nbasic approximation of the amount of effort. We first use\nthe traditional \(most-often-used in practice today e.g., [1 that we use in this\nexperiment are common basic keywords \(“kill”, “error”, “fail”,\n“exception” and “died that are usually a sign of failure in a\nlog line. We applied this search on all three BDA Apps. We\nmeasure the number of log lines with these keywords as the\nbaseline effort.\nTo apply our approach for deployment verification, we\nfirst recover execution sequences of the three BDA Apps,\nwhen deployed on a cloud environment. We then compare\nthe two sets of log sequences \(small-scale environment and\nlarge cloud identify the delta set \(the execution sequences\nTABLE III\nEFFORT REQUIRED TO VERIFY THE CLOUD DEPLOYMENT USING OUR\nAPPROACH VERSUS THE TRADITIONAL KEYWORD SEARCH.\nUsing our approach Using keyword search\n# execution unique #log line\nsequences log events with keyword\nWordCount 19 64 467\nPageRank 55 83 1,739\nJACK 20 67 726\nTABLE IV\nREPEATED EXECUTION SEQUENCES BETWEEN RUNNING THE BDA APPS\nONCE, TWICE AND THREE TIMES.\nonce and twice  match the\nnumber of execution sequences and log events that are required\nto examine.\nResults\nThe results from Table

However, when moving to bigger runs, the\nexecution sequences will not increase dramatically. The reason\nis that most of the runs, in the abstract level, are identical.\nTherefore, the size of the final sequences to verify will show\nvery minor increases. However, the log lines to be verified\nusing traditional approach always increase proportional to\nthe data. Table IV shows the number of repeated execution\nsequences when running the same BDA App once twice, and\nthree times. In Table V, we report the number of log lines to be\nverified using the traditional approach for the same BDA App\nexecutions. The large portion of repeated execution sequences\nin the number of execution sequences vs. the rapid growth in\nthe number of log lines emphasizes the effectiveness of our\napproach in terms of effort reduction during verification of the\ndeployment of a BDA App in the cloud.\n\n\n\nOur approach reduces the verification effort by be-\ntween 86% to 97% when verifying the cloud deploy-\nment of BDA Apps.\nB. RQ2: How Precise and Informative is Our Approach When\nVerifying Cloud Deployments?\nMotivation\nAs discussed in RQ1, a flagged sequence \(using our ap-\nproach using the traditional approach We consider such flagged sequences or log\nevents, e.g., those that are related to “ Task exception and\n“Speculative execution”, as false positive results that affect\nthe precision of the approaches. Therefore in this question,\nwe compare the two approaches in terms of precision. We\nalso discuss how our approach facilitates the verification of\nthe flagged execution sequences.\nApproach\nIn this research question, we categorize the flagged logs/ex-\necution sequences by the traditional/our approach into two\nclasses: actual failures \(true positives false positives actual\nfailure, we intentionally injected three different failures, which\nare commonly observed by BDA App developers [13], into\nour experimental environment, during the execution of the\nthree subject programs. These three failures are all encountered\noften in our real-life experience of using Hadoop in the large\nindustrial clouds. The three injected failures are as follows:\n1 common\nsystem errors in distributed computing. To inject this\nfailure, we manually turn off one machine in the cluster.\n2 However,\nthe new machines in the cluster may miss supporting\nlibraries or the versions of the supporting libraries may\nbe outdated. We inject this failure by removing one\nrequired library of the analysis.\n3 disk space. Disks often run out of space while\na BDA App is running on the platform due to the large\namount of generated intermediate data. We manually fill\nup one of the machine’s disks to inject this failure.\nNext, we manually analyzed the log sequences in the HTML\nreports and identified any false positive instances.\nResults\nTable VI summarizes the number of false positives, total\nnumber of flagged sequences/log lines, and the precision of\nboth approaches. The precision of our approach is 21, 38, and\n10% for WordCount PageRank, and JACK respectively. The\nrange of the number of false positive sequences to verify is 15\nto 34 sequences \(16-49 log events WordCount,\nPageRank, and JACK respectively, while the range of the\nnumber of false positive log lines to verify is 432 to 650\nlog lines. A more detailed analysis of the results shows\nthat the only case where the precision of our approach is\noutperformed by traditional approach is with JACK BDA App\nwhere one single exception is appearing in almost every log\nline. Though the traditional approach is of higher precision,\nhowever, the same exception produces 1,467 log lines that\nmust be examined each by hand to determine their context and\ndecided whether they are problematic or not. Unfortunately,\nsince a keyword approach does not provide any abstraction all\nlog lines would need to be examined carefully, even though\nthey all are instances of the same abstract problem.\nNote that the recall for both approaches is 100%, since all\ninstances of log lines and execution sequences related to the\nfailures are identified by the keyword 


search. However, there\nare cases that deployment failure might not be possible to\ncatch by a keyword search For example, a temporary network\ncongestion may cause the pending queue to be very long, but\nlogs may record that the pending queue is too long without\nmaking use of an “error” like string in the log line. In some\ncases, a node in the cloud may even fail without recording any\nerror message [14]. In such situations our approach is even\nsuperior, since the traditional approach simply would not work\n\(as no “error” log lines are produced VI\nNUMBER OF FALSE POSITIVES, TRUE POSITIVES, AND THE PRECISION OF BOTH OUR APPROACH AND THE TRADITIONAL KEYWORD SEARCH.\nUsing our approach Using keyword search\nfalse positive true positive precision false positive true positive precision\nWordCount 15 4 21% 432 35 7%\nPageRank 34 21 38% 272 1467 84%\nJACK 18 2 10% 650 76 10%\neach log line.

Even after all the reduction that is performed\nby the keyword search approach, 467 to 1,739 log lines\nshould be verified manually.

DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we discuss other possible features of our\napproach. In particular, one feature is to support developers\nto understand the runtime differences when migrating BDA\nApps from one platform to another.\nTo find the most optimal and economical platform for\nBDA Apps, a BDA App may need to be migrated from\none Big Data Analytics platform to another [1]. This type\nof redeployments requires similar verifications as discussed in\nthe research questions. Therefore, developers need an approach\nto help them in identifying any run-time behaviour change,\ncaused by the migration Identifying the differences between\nthe execution of the BDA App in the two environments help\nverifying the new deployment and flag any potential failure or\nanomalies.\nTo assess the ability of our approach for identifying the\npotential redeployment problems in the cloud, we migrated\nthe PageRank program from Hadoop to Pig platform. Pig [15]\nis a Hadoop-based [4] platform designed for analysis of\nmassive amounts of data. To reduce the effort of coding\nin the MapReduce paradigm, Pig provides a high-level data\nprocessing language called Pig Latin [15]. Using Pig Latin,\ndevelopers can improve their productivity by focusing on the\nprocess of data analysis instead of writing the boiler-plating\nMapReduce coding [16].\nWe ran PageRank three times on Hadoop and three times\non Pig. After examining the sequence reports we could note\nthe following differences between both platforms:\n1. Hadoop-based PageRank Has More MapReduce Steps than\nPig-based PageRank\nIn our implementation, the Hadoop-based PageRank con-\nsists of four MapReduce steps, while the Pig-based PageRank\nhas eight lines of Pig scripts \(each line is one step in the\npipeline of the data analysis real-life execu-\ntion, the Pig platform groups the eight steps of data process\ninto three MapReduce steps Since the Hadoop platform does\nnot have such a feature of grouping MapReduce steps, the\nexecution of Hadoop-based PageRank has four MapReduce\nsteps, as it is written.\n2. Hadoop-based PageRank Has More Tasks than Pig-based\nPageRank\nWe examine the distribution of sequences in both im-\nplementations of PageRank. The results show that the total\nnumber of log sequences from the Hadoop-based PageRank\nis much larger than the Pig-based PageRank. For example,\none run of the Hadoop-based PageRank generates, in total,\nover 700 execution log sequences in the Task log, while this\nnumber by the Pig-based PageRank is less than 30. This result\nindicates that the Pig-based PageRank splits the execution into\na significantly smaller number of tasks than the Hadoop-based\none. The reason is that based on the Hadoop instructions [4],\nthe number of Map Tasks should be set to a relatively large\nnumber. Therefore, in our case study, the number of Map Tasks\nis configured to 200 However, Pig optimizes the platform\nconfigurations at run-time and reduces the number of Map\nTasks to a smaller number to get better performance.\nIdentifying such differences would be extremely difficult by\nonly looking at the raw log lines. Thus our approach not only\nassists developers of BDA Apps with the first deployment in\nthe cloud but also helps them with any redeployment. We do\nnote that our approach only works when the new platform is\na derivative of the older platform \(e.g., in the case of Pig,\nit provides a high-level abstraction to create programs that\neventually still run on MapReduce. Hence we can compare\nthe eventual MapReduce execution for the Pig program against\nthe old MapReduce execution 


THREATS TO VALIDITY\nWe present the limitations and threats to validity for our\napproach in this section.\n409\nA. External Validity\nAs a proof of concept, we illustrate the use of our approach\nto address the challenges encountered in our experience. How-\never, there are still other challenges of developing and testing\nBDA Apps, such as choosing an architecture that optimizes for\ncost and performance [1]. Our approach may not be able to\naddress other challenges. Additional case studies are needed to\nbetter understand the strengths and limitations of our approach.\nWe only demonstrate the use of our approach on Hadoop,\none of the most widely adopted underlying frameworks for\nBDA Apps, with three injected failures. In practice, we have\ntried our approach on several commercial BDA Apps on\nother underlying platforms. The only effort for adapting our\napproach to other platforms of BDA Apps is to determine\nthe parameters for abstracting and linking the platform logs.\nAdditional studies on other open source and commercial\nplatforms with other types of failures are needed to study the\ngeneralizability of our approach.\nAll our experiments are carried out on a small-scale private\nexperimental cluster, which mimics the large cloud with 40\ncores. However, a typical environment for BDA Apps has\nmore than 1,000 cores, such as Amazon EC2 [17]. The logs of\nsuch large-scale clouds do lead to considerably more logs and\nmore sequences. From our experiences using our approach\nin practice on such large clouds, we have found that our\napproach performs even better than grep since the abstraction\nand sequencing leads to a drastic reduction in the amount of\ndata. Such observation was noted in our case study as well.\nOne interesting note is to support such large clouds we needed\nto re-implement our own approach to run in a cloud setting\nusing the Hadoop platform \(since we needed to process a very\nlarge amount of logs and summarize them into a small number\nof event sequences be\nlocalized, for example, linking Hadoop task logs only needs\nthe logs from one task, our approach is parallelizable with\nminimal effort.\nB. Construct Validity\nWe use abstracted execution logs to perform log clustering\nand to learn the runtime behaviour. However, the execution\nlogs may not contain all the information of the runtime\nbehaviour. Other types of dynamic information, such as execu-\ntion tracing, may have more details about the execution of the\nBDA Apps. We use the execution logs rather than other more\ndetailed dynamic information in this work, because execution\nlogs are readily available and are widely used in practice\n\(leading to no performance overhead Apps \(e.g., Hadoop the bugs in the BDA Apps but\nrather assist in reducing the effort in deploying BDA Apps\nin a cloud environment. Therefore, the platform logs provide\nmore and better information than application logs.\nIdentifying the re-occurrences of sub-sequences can also be\nused in our approach to reduce the event sequences, similar\nto our method of eliminating repetitions in Section IV. In\nour experience, we performed sub-sequence detection on the\nrecovered event sequences and found that it did not suppress\nexecution log sequences as good as our repetition elimination\napproach. In addition, the process of sub-sequence detection\nis very time consuming and slows down the overall analysis.\nTherefore, we did not use the sub-sequence detection in\npractice. For other BDA Apps and other distributed platforms,\nsub-sequence detection may be effective in reducing the log\nsequences.\nIX. RELATED WORK\nIn this section, we discuss the related work in two areas.\nA. Dynamic Software Understanding\nFischer et al. [18] instrument the source code and produce\ndifferent kinds of visualizations to track and to understand\nthe evolution of software at the module level. Kothari et\nal. [19] propose a technique to evaluate the efficiency of\nsoftware feature development by studying the evolution of\ncall graphs generated by execution traces. Ro¨thlisberger et\nal. [20] implement an IDE called Hermion, which captures\nrun-time information from an application under development.\nThe run-time information is used to understand the navigation\nand browsing of source code in an IDE.\nRecent work by Beschastnikh et al. [21] designed an\nautomated tool that infers execution models from logs. The\nmodels can be used by developers to verify and diagnose bugs.\nOur techniques aim to provide context of logs when deploying\nBDA Apps in cloud.\nIn addition, Cornelissen et al. [22] perform a systematic\nsurvey of using dynamic analysis to assist in program un-\nderstanding and comprehension. FIELD is a development\nenvironment created by Reiss et al. [23] that contains the\nfeatures to dynamically understand the execution of a program.\nHowever the environment is rather designed for traditional\napplication development, and not for the cloud deployment of\nBDA Apps.\nB. Hadoop Log Analysis\nHadoop typically runs on large-scale clusters of machines\nwith hundreds or even thousands of nodes. As a result, large\namounts of log data are generated by Hadoop. To collect and\nanalyze the large amounts of log data from Hadoop, Boulon et\nal. built Chukwa [24]. This framework monitors Hadoop clus-\nters in real-time and stores the log data in Hadoop’s distributed\nfile system \(HDFS leveraging Hadoop’s infrastructure,\nChukwa can scale to thousands of nodes in both collection\nand analysis However, Chukwa focuses more on collecting\nlogs without the ability to perform complex analysis.\nTan et al 


introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
