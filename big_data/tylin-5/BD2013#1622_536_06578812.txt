Context Matters: Improving the Uses of Big Data for \nForecasting Civil Unrest \nEmerging Phenomena and Big Data nPedro Manrique*, Hong Qi*, Ana Morgenstern*, Nicolás Velásquez*, Tsai-Ching Lu** and Neil Johnson n*University of Miami, Physics Department, University of Miami \n**HRL Laboratories, Malibu, CA \n nAbstract—Open Source Indicators \(OSI GT associated \nwith behavior that precede episodes of civil unrest. There are \nmyriad reasons why societies may become unstable: Our analysis \ndoes not require or inquire the underlying reasons for discontent \nbut instead takes into account differences associated with \nvariegated social contexts. This paper examines instances of this \nvolatile behavior and suggests a simple model for predicting civil \nunrest events using GT as an open source indicator \(OSI within a particular social context. As such, \npaying attention to the particular signals associated from each ncountry is an important moderator for any model keen on \npredicting cases of extreme social behavior such as civil unrest. \nKeywords— big data, prediction, civil unrest, emerging \nphenomena, open source indicator. \nI INTRODUCTION \n \nSocial instability is not a new phenomenon; it has long \nbeen a feature of state-society relations [1]. Technological \nadvances have created favorable conditions for forecasting \ncertain types of mobilizations or protests [2] [3]. Open source \ninformation sources of data offer a new avenue of research nwhere information flows provide an insight into human \nbehavior. Uncovering how these open sources may help predict \nhuman behavior is currently one of the key questions in \nharnessing the potential of “big data.” This analysis focuses on \ndata from Google Trends \(GT indicators can help predict civil \nunrest [4] [5]. The predictions produced by the model were \ncompared to a database of human-coded civil unrest events \ncollected by an independent agency from several major news nsources.\n1\n For the purposes of this research, we refer to this \ndatabase as a Gold Standard Report \(GSR which establishes \nan independent version of the “ground truth” against which \npredictions can be checked nThe current challenge with tapping into the unchartered \nterrain “big data” is not accessing information rather, it is \nmaking sense of it [6]. The analysis of information is to be \ntargeted and narrowed by the type of events to be predicted \nwithin a time-frame in a specific location. For these purposes, \n n1\n The primary datasources are The New York Times, The \nGuardian Clarin, El Mercurio, Reforma, El Universal. The \nGSR represents an aggregate form of these sources. \ntuning the data is important for idiomatic differences and \ncontextual information. Taking this into account dissembling \ndata from useful and non-useful information is key. The \nmethod proposed focuses on key civil unrest terms.  \nThe model used for prediction relies on a search in volume \nof event-related terms and their momenta. It posits that an \nincreased interest in civil unrest terms will produce observable \nreal-time behavior consistent with those terms. This type of \nconsistent uninterrupted analysis of big streams of data may \npresent contradictory results if close attention is not paid at the \ncontextual realities of each country. \nII. LATIN AMERICA AS A LABORATORY FOR CIVIL UNREST \nPREDICTION \n \nLatin America offers a useful laboratory for analysis of \ncivil unrest events as there is variation in the volume of cases \nof this complex phenomenon [7]. Social media is a growing \ncategory of political discourse. Although most of the countries nare Spanish-speaking, there are idiomatic variations regarding \nuses and spelling of some words.\n2\n  \nThe simplicity of the model allowed for experimentation \nwith different key words. Results provided information on nmissed predictions, on which forensic analysis of events \nrevealed nuances across countries. Although Latin American \ncountries share features, salience of issues that may lead to \ncivil unrest is contextual. For instance, in Venezuela recent \nelectoral periods were fraught with mobilizations. On the other \nhand, in Chile the most salient issue was related to education \nreform and a large segment of civil unrest occurrences there nwas carried out by students.  \n \n                                                          \n2\n Brazil is excluded from the results presented in this paper. \n978-1-4673-6213-9/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 169 ISI 2013, June 4-7, 2013, Seattle, Washington, USA\nA re-adjustment of thresholds from key terms improves \npredictability. The system runs all combinations of pre-selected \nkey terms and calculates values for accuracy, sensitivity and nspecificity. The model looks for changes in volume for two \nconsecutive time steps above a specific threshold and selects \nword pairings.  \nFirst, there is a selection of all the combinations \(key terms \nand thresholds that maximize accuracy. From this sub-set the \nmodel selects combinations that maximize sensitivity. Finally nfrom this subset, it selects all the combinations that maximize \nspecificity. If this sub-set has more than one element it selects \nthe first one. The system runs a combination of parameters that \nmaximizes B1, P1 and P0 values in that order.  Some of the \nkey terms\n3\n presented double meaning, pairing with other civil \nunrest terms yielded the best results.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n3\n Including protesta \(protest strike demonstration or rally march 


paro \(stoppage Spanish-speaking countries, differences \nin use and variation in politicized issues makes differentiation nnecessary to increase accuracy of predictions [8] [9][10].  \nTable 1: Summary of Results \n \n170\n  \n \n \n nFigure 3. Civil Unrest occurrences for Argentina, Chile, \nMexico and Venezuela. The cases under study here show the \nperiod under analysis for prediction from January, 2011 to \nMarch, 2012. Green dots represent varied types of civil unrest \noccurrences.  The black dots show predictions, the accurate \npredictions are marked by both a green and black dot. \n In sum, context-specific knowledge will enhance uses of \nbig data for prediction of any event. In the case of civil unrest \nevents, the intricacies related to social human behavior need to nbe accounted for even if in a very minimal way such as \ncontextualizing the use of information through nuances in \nlanguage uses.  \nIII. CONCLUSION  \nAs these results suggest, investing in a priori knowledge nabout a region improves uses of big data. Adding a contextual \nelement provides a baseline from which the uses of open \nsources can be disaggregated and analyzed.  \n Ultimately, one of the drawbacks of this model is the \nlack of complexity due to its reliance on momentum. Human \nbehavior on a particular issue may continue even after the \nevent has passed just like a heavy tail distribution. Further \nresearch will involve improving these techniques based on \naccumulated data of longer time-frames. For civil unrest, as \nmodels for prediction will necessitate investing initial thought \ninto specificities of each region. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nWe acknowledge support for this research from the \nIntelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity \(IARPA of Interior National Business Center \(DoI / NBC nauthorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for \nGovernmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright nannotation thereon.

subsets.\nThe latter two properties are a signi?cant contrast from\nthe best previously known approach for estimating key group\nsizes; i.e., TopCluster [3]. In TopCluster, the ?nal histogram\nestimation of the key group sizes is in?uenced by both 1 probability property of the sketch structure provides a\nmathematical guarantee for accurate estimation on key group\nsizes and has been widely adopted for data stream processing.\nIn Count-Min sketch [1], an estimation for the group size of\nkey k is given by\nSˆk = min\ni=1,...,d\nCG[i, hi\(k is given in the\nfollowing lemma. The proof of this lemma follows directly\nfrom the results in [1].\nLemma 1 The size estimate Sˆk of key group k has the\nfollowing guarantees: Sk ? Sˆk, and with probability at least\n1 Sˆk ? Sk + ?S. Here ? = 1/ed, ? = e/w, and S is the\ntotal number of key-value pairs.\nHowever, this key group size estimation method cannot be\ndirectly applied to design the key-group-to-reducer assignment\nalgorithm. In Count-Min sketch, the key must be supplied to\nobtain the group size estimation. Since the key information is\nlost in the aggregation of the sketch, we either need to record\nit in a separate data structure \(which introduces additional\nstorage overhead eliminates the bene?t of one-pass pro?ling.\nIV. SKETCH-BASED LOAD BALANCING ALGORITHM\nIn this section, we investigate the design of the partition\nfunction, which maps the intermediate key to a reducer index,\nbased on the key group size information as summarized in the\nglobal sketch. Formally, let K be the key space and R be the\nnumber of reducers. A partition function ? : K ? {1, 2, ..., R}\nmaps key k to the index of the desired reducer r = ?\(k such, the load at reducer r can\neasily be derived as S\(r k k.\nBy designing the partition function i.e., to\nminimize the maximum reducer load follows.\nmin\n?\nmax\nr=1,2,...,R\nS\(r 1 algorithm. This algorithm works directly on the global\npacking \nalgorithm …. \nkey groups \nkey group packing \n1 n2 \nd optimal sketch packing \nsketch \nFig. 1.

As a result, the algorithm is scalable to a large number\nof key groups.\nAs shown in Figure 1, the basic operation in the optimal\nsketch packing algorithm is very similar to the key group\npacking algorithm. Instead of working over the key groups,\nthe optimal sketch packing algorithm works over the counters\nin each row in the sketch. As discussed before, the sketch\ncontains d rows, while each row contains w counters. Each\nrow can be treated as a linear projection of the original key\ngroups. Since w is very small compared to the data space |D|,\nthe optimal sketch packing algorithm can utilize the key group\npacking algorithm \(Algorithm 1 process for each row and chooses the one\nwith the minimum reduce-phase imbalance ratio.\nAlgorithm 2 presents the details of the optimal sketch\npacking algorithm. In this algorithm, ?min records the current\nminimum reduce-phase imbalance ratio. It is initialized to\nR, which is the maximum reduce-phase imbalance ratio The\n?min variable records the sketch-cell-to-reducer mappings in\nas the current best solution.\nEvery time the optimal sketch packing algorithm sends one\nrow in the sketch to the key group packing algorithm to\nperform pack operation.

IMPLEMENTATION WITH HADOOP\nWe implement our load balancing solution in Apache\nHadoop. The overall implementation involves two MapReduce\njobs. An additional pro?ling MapReduce job needs to be\nexecuted before the real job, to sample the data, build the\nsketch and compute the sketch-cell-to-reducer assignment.\nA block-level sampling technique is introduced to reduce\nthe extra running overhead brought by the pro?ling job. In\nHadoop, input data is stored in Hadoop File System \(HDFS equal-sized data blocks. The block-level sampling technique\nrandomly selects a small percent of data blocks to build the\nsketch. In comparison to the record-level sampling technique,\nthe block-level sampling has a better 


running ef?ciency with\nsimilar accuracy [8]. As shown in our experimental analysis,\na 5% block-level sampling rate delivers good load balancing\nperformance for all applications and datasets evaluated in this\nstudy.\nIn the pro?ling job, each mapper processes the sampled\ninput data blocks and builds its local sketch. All local sketches\nare sent to one reducer, where the global sketch is generated.\nOur optimal sketch packing algorithm is also deployed at this\nreducer. The output of the pro?ling job is a sketch-cell-to-\nreducer mapping. Along with the set of hash functions that\nare used to build the sketch, this mapping will be used as the\nnew partition function for the real job to direct the shuf?e\n\(i.e., reducer assignment EVALUATION\nA. Experiment Setup\nApplications and Dataset. We investigate two real world\napplications to assess the performance of MapReduce jobs\n1http://vanets.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/publications/Sketch13Report.pdf\nusing our load balancing mechanism: PageRank and Inverted\nIndexing. We evaluate PageRank using four real datasets:\nFlickr2, LiveJournal3, Twitter, and YouTube4. Each dataset\nrepresents a graph, where the rank of each vertex is computed\nvia PageRank. We also use four synthetic datasets, whose\ndata size distribution follows a Zipf distribution5 to evaluate\nthe impact of skew on the algorithm performance. Inverted\nIndexing is evaluated using two additional datasets: DBLP6\nand Wikipedia7 datasets. Each dataset contains several publi-\ncations/documents, where an inverted index is built for each\nword. Table I provides summary statistics of the real datasets.\nRunning Environments. We conduct experiments in both\nsimulated and real MapReduce cluster environments. In the\nsimulated environment, we evaluate the accuracy and the\nperformance of the sketch-based solution in estimating the key\ngroup size and achieving reducer-phase load balancing. The\nfour datasets with relatively small sizes \(i.e., DBLP, Flickr,\nLiveJournal, and YouTube environment.\nWe use the Amazon Elastic MapReduce service for the\nexperiments over the two massive datasets Twitter and\nWikipedia. In this environment, 20 m1-medium instances are\nused with a separate master instance Each instance has 1\nvCPU and 2 ECU with 4 GB of memory and 410 GB disk.\nThe HDFS block size is set to 64 MB and each instance is\ncon?gured to run at most two map tasks and two reduce tasks\nconcurrently. We disable the speculative task execution feature\nto better analyze the running time of each task. By default,\neach MapReduce job is con?gured with 40 reducers.\nBaseline Algorithms. We compare our optimal sketch\npacking \(SP with: 1 HD assignment; 2 TC key\ngroup packing \(BP Algorithm 1 accurate sizes. Note\nthat we only evaluate the key group packing algorithm in our\nsimulated environment, where the input datasets are small.\nFor the two massive datasets, it is not pragmatic to hold the\naccurate sizes for all key groups in memory, and the program\nwill throw OutOfMemory exception.\nSketch and Pro?le Settings. In most experiments, the\nsketch structure is set with size w = 1000 and d = 5, which\nrequires less than 1 MB memory. For TopCluster algorithm, we\ncon?gure it with k = 5000, which leads to a similar memory\nusage for fair comparison. For both algorithms, we adopt a\nblock-level sampling strategy that samples the HDFS blocks\nat a 5 sampling rate.\n2http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-?ickr.html\n3http://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-LiveJournal1.html\n4http snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Youtube.html\n5For a given Zipf distribution with parameter z, the number of records in\nthe kth key group is proportional to k?z n6http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml\n7http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/\n159\nTABLE I\nDATASET SUMMARY\nApplication Dataset # of key groups # of key-value pairs\nPageRank\nFlickr 94,190 2,316,948\nYoutube 374,785 2,987,624\nLiveJournal 4,308,452 68,993,773\nTwitter 40,104,238 1,539,743,478\nInverted Indexing DBLP 110,760 1,268,017Wikipedia 14,180,286 1,487,606,462\nB. Simulated Environment\n1 group sizes are\nnot directly used for load balancing, they serve as a basis of our\nload balancing algorithm This allows us to derive important\ninsight into the performance of the load balancing algorithm.\nThus, we ?rst evaluate the performance of sketch in terms of\nits key group size estimation.\nThese experiments use four real datasets to assess the extent\nto which the techniques can estimate key group sizes. In\nFigure 2, we rank key groups according to their real size\n\(Real Figure 2, sketch provides an accurate estimation for\nhighly ranked key groups \(which have large sizes the\nperformance of the sketch-based method is directly correlated\nwith the degree of data skew [11]. Of all the datasets, sketch\nachieves the best performance on the DBLP dataset \(shown in\nFigure 2\(d with the observation that DBLP\nhas the most skewed distribution of key group sizes.\n2 Balancing: We compare the perfor-\nmance of our SP algorithm with HD, TC and BP. This set\nof experiments is deployed with four real datasets and four\nsynthetic datasets. Each synthetic dataset is composed of 50\nmillion key-value pairs, organized in 5 million groups. We\nvary the Zipf parameter z ? {0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}. To 


evaluate\nthe algorithm performance with different scenarios, we vary\nthe number of reducers from 40 to 200 For each group\nof experiments, we record the number of intermediate key-\nvalue pairs assigned to each reducer as a representation of\nthe reducer workload. Then, we calculate the reduce-phase\nimbalance ratio.\nFigure 3 shows the results with the four real datasets.\nSince Hadoop utilizes a hash function as its default setting,\nits performance largely depends on the input data and cannot\nprovide any assurance over the reducer load. The TC algorithm\ncan provide some assurance, but it only tracks the top-k key\ngroups, as such, its performance is also limited. The BP\ncaptures all key group sizes and therefore delivers the best\nperformance Our SP algorithm requires much less memory\nthan BP while delivering competitive load balancing. In all\ncases SP signi?cantly outperforms HD and TC.\nIn Figures 3\(a b c ratio close to 1.0.

Furthermore, the SP algorithm\ncan achieve a load balancing performance that is close to the\nBP algorithm in most situations.\n3 Robust to Data Sequence: As discussed earlier, the dis-\ntributed streaming data model dictates that robustness is a core\nrequirement for composing an appropriate MapReduce data\nrepresentation. In this section, we perform several experiments\nto evaluate our algorithm’s performance under different data\narriving sequences and compare them to the TC algorithm.\nWe generate two types of datasets from the original Flickr\nand Youtube datasets. We sort key groups according to their\nsizes either in an increasing order \(I order\n\(D algorithm over those data\nstreams and examine their reduce-phase workload imbalance\nratios. The results are presented in Figure 5. As shown in the\n?gure, our SP algorithm is robust to data arrival sequence and\nshow stable performance.

RELATED WORK\nThe load imbalance issue within the MapReduce framework\nhas recently attracted tremendous research interest. [4] pre-\nsented a solution for reduce-phase skew, which assigns key\ngroups to reducers based on a locality/fairness model. This\napproach requires loading all key group size information into\nmemory to perform the packing operation, which is impractical\nwhen massive datasets are processed.\nTo build scalable key group size estimation structure, [3]\npresented TopCluster, which builds a key group histogram with\nk buckets devoted to the top-k frequent keys and 1 bucket\ndevoted to all remaining keys. In TopCluster, different input\ndata sequence may generate different estimation results, as\n161\n 0\n 0.5\n 1\n 1.5\n 2\n 2.5\n 3\n 3.5\n 4\nHD TC SP\nIm\nb\na\nla\nn\nc\ne\n r\na\nti\no\nAlgorithm\nImbalanceRatio\n\(a 0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\nHD TC SP\nR\nu\nn\nn\nin\ng\n t\nim\ne\n \(\n1\n0\n0\n0\ns\n b running time\nFig. 6.

The top-k histograms are also vulnerable to merge\noperations, where the “named” keys from the top groups may\nbe moved to the “anonymous group during merge operation\nand can not be accurately recovered later. In contrast to\nTopCluster, our sketch-based solutions are both robust to the\ndata arrival sequence and resilient to merge operation.\nSkewTune 7] adopted another type of imbalance-handling\nmechanism, which does not require a key group size pro?ling\nphase. SkewTune dynamically monitors the task execution\nand estimates the remaining time for each task. Whenever\na machine becomes idle, SkewTune mitigates workload from\noverloaded machines to the idle machine. SkewTune may incur\nsigni?cant communication overhead when moving workload\nacross different machines especially with massive dataset.\nIn comparison, our approach can avoid workload transfer by\nassigning them carefully before the reduce task execution.\nThe aforementioned approaches are general solutions that\ncan be integrated with the MapReduce framework to support\na variety of applications. There are also approaches that\nwork only for special types of applications, such as the join\noperation. [10] studied the theta-join in MapReduce and [12]\nconsidered the multi-way theta-join. To cope with load imbal-\nance, these approaches ?rst pro?le the input data to collect\ndistribution information and then utilize these information to\nachieve reduce-phase load balancing. However, the scalability\nissue associated with the pro?ling process was not considered.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we introduced a scalable and robust load\nbalancing solution for MapReduce framework based on a\nnovel sketch-based data structure. We implemented and in-\ntegrated our solution within Hadoop. Experimental studies\nusing PageRank and Inverted Indexing over real and synthetic\ndatasets show that our solution outperforms both Hadoop de-\nfault implementation and the current state-of-the-art solution.\nWe plan to conduct more experiments with various data sets\nin the future.\nIX.

Impact of d on Write Conflict\nThis experiment is to show the trend of write conflict\nwith respect to d. Without loss of generality, parameters are\nconfigured such as ? = 0.01,Pc = 2%,Te = 1000ms and\nTo = 2000ms.\nAs shown in Figure 8, the x-axis represents the number of\nreplicas n \(2 ? n ? 9 1 ? d ? [n/2 y-axis shows the probability of\nwrite conflict. For highlighting the variances of different Pwc,\nwe use lgPwc to replace Pwc. We can see that the probability\nof write conflict Pwc decreases as d is increased for any fixed\nreplica number n, and declines in steps that are at least one\norder of magnitude. Note that when d n/2], the probability\nof write conflict Pwc is 0. So they are not shown in the figure.\nE. Impact of d on Latency\nEquation \(8 change of write\nlatency with respect to d more intuitively. The message delay\ndistribution f\(x 0.01. And we also perform a\nnull write to eliminate the influences of log and commit time.\nHowever, even the times of log and commit exist, they do not\ninterfere with our results, because Lw\(1 their\nvalues which will be removed.\nFigure 9 indicates the impact of number of ACKs d\non Latency. As shown the x-axis represents the number of\nreplicas n \(2 ? n ? 9 2 ? d ? [n/2 1 d 1 d increases as d rises. Here we focus on d ? [2, [n/2]+1],\nin fact Lw\(d n]. Another\ninteresting observation is that latency with a fixed d decreases\nwhile n is increased. The reason is that the coordinator has\nmore alternative ACKs to select the fastest d ones.\nF. Consistency v.s. Latency\nAs defined in section VI, consistency=1 ? Pwc. Now we\ncombine the results of above two experiments and show the\ntradeoff between consistency and latency. As shown in Figure\n10, the x-axis represents the latency Lw\(d which has removed\nthe value of Lw\(1 Latency\nFig. 10. Consistency v.s. Latency\nPwc\(d 7 and the corresponding d\(1 ? d ?

[1, [n/2] + 1],\nit shows that stronger consistency must lead to worse latency\nand better latency must result in weaker consistency.\nG. An Example for Tradeoff of Consistency and Latency\nAssume that there is an online store like Amazon. And it\nhas used RSMs in its sales system. Although we try to collect\nmore practical data about ?, ? and ? \(defined in section VI not\nwant to know the exact value of system benefit B\(d the benefit ratio of\nlatency ? by statistics methods, and then determine d? for the\nmaximal system benefit B\(d and\ntheir average price is V .

Therefore, we have that ? = 2.2SV\nFig. 11. The Variable Part of System Benefit\nand ? = 0.01%SV .\nSection VI shows that the overall benefit B\(d variable part v\(d 2.2Pwc\(d E\(Lw\(d Lw\(1  1] and n ?

We can see that v\(d d replica number\nis 4 or 5, which is neither non-uniform total order broadcast\nnor Paxos implementation. So it shows that common practical\nRSM systems \(with d = 1 and d = [n/2]+1 aspect of overall system benefit. We should\nconsider more intermediate states in the consistency spectrum.\nVIII. RELATED WORK\nWe have surveyed many replicated state machine tech-\nniques [23-26] and their variants such as [27-29]. Their three\nrepresentative implementations are non-uniform total order\nbroadcast Paxos and uniform total order broadcast. Although\nRSMs has been long studied, in this work we do not want to\ndesign better algorithms but try to quantitatively analyze these\nworks from the aspects of consistency and latency. In addition,\nprior analysis works [24,33] on RSMs confine in the three\nrepresentative implementations of RSMs and their variants,\nand few considers consistency and latency simultaneously.\nOur analysis covers more than the three typical ones and\nquantitatively reveals the tradeoff between consistency 


and\nlatency.\nConsistency, which has been long studied [39], attracts\nmore eyes in recent years. With the consideration of CAP [3]\nand PACELC [4], people develop a lot of consistency models,\nfrom weakest eventual consistency [9], timeline consistency\n[40] to causal consistency [41]. Instead of developing a new\nconsistency model or performance optimization for existing\nmodels, we discuss when and how the inconsistency occurs,\nand further measure its degree with a probabilistic model in\nthe context of RSMs.\nThere are several works [17,18 presenting bounded read\nstaleness from data versions, stale time and staleness proba-\nbility to evaluate the inconsistency of quorum like [15], anti-\nentropy [35] systems, where writes are committed by vector\n10\nclocks 16] with semantic reconciliation [5] in causal order as\nopposed to total order of RSMs. In this work, we focus on\nwrite inconsistency for RSMs, since read serializability can be\neasily guaranteed in total order to eliminate read staleness.\nSome previous works have been done on write inconsisten-\ncy. [19,20] provide techniques to make writes satisfying some\nconstraints, which use strong and weak consistency to ensure\nthe constraints are not violated. Write divergency of replicas\nare limited in [21,22]. For example, [21] provides some metrics\nsuch as numerical error and order error for data items, and\nthen presents a variety of algorithms for writes to guarantee\npredefined metrics. These write inconsistency models aim to\nimprove the performance in the absence of crash failures, but\nwe want to know how much inconsistency incurred by crash\nfailures a replication system may encounter, rather than confine\nwrites to some constraints, or bound the maximum deviation\nof a value from its newest version.\nIn the context of RSMs, in this work we quantify write\ninconsistency by the probability of write conflict while con-\nsidering crash failures. Furthermore, we calculate write latency\nand describe how to quantitatively make consistency and\nlatency tradeoff from the aspect of system benefit.\nIX. DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we provide several problems that should be\nnoted or considered in future work.\nA. Quorum Systems\nQuorum systems define sets of replicas W written to and\nR read from, which can be configured such as ONE\(W=1 W = [n/2] + 1 W = n other values. This is very like the three representative\nimplementations of RSMs, but they are essentially different.\nThe reason is that writes of quorum systems are ordered\ncausally and those of RSMs are totally ordered. Thus some\nconditions result in write conflict for RSMs but not for quorum\nsystems. For instance write duplication may occur when the\ncoordinator is falsely suspected. In contrast, it is meaningless\nto discuss write conflict for quorum systems because we can\nnot decide the original write and possible duplicated one are\nin the same order or not for the partial orders of writes. In\nthe practical quorum systems at present they mostly view the\nsecond write as a new write.\nHowever, our partial work can be useful for analyzing\nquorum systems. The formula on the expectation of laten-\ncy\(equation \(8 if\nreplacing W to d.\nB. Failure Mode and Failure Detection\nAs discussed in section II, our work is based on the\nassumption of non-Byzantine failures. If we enlarge failure\nmodes to Byzantine ones, our work should be made corre-\nsponding modification. In future work, we will consider this\nextension.\nFor non-Byzantine failures, we have modeled a common\nand popular heartbeat based but not adaptive and fast failure\ndetector Some optimized failure detectors [31,36] use syn-\nchronized clocks or adjust heartbeat intervals adaptively to\nachieve faster failure detection. This means that the expression\nThb2?Thb1 > To?Te in the formula of the probability of false\nsuspicion Pfs = Pr\(Thb2 ? Thb1 > To ? Te detectors.\nC. Coordinator Election and Failure Recovery\nWhile presenting the formula of write duplication, we have\nnoted that coordinator election and failure recovery [32] may\ninfluence its result.\nRSMs run coordinator election and failure recovery after\nsuspicions on coordinators for synchronizing the states of\nboth committed writes and historical records for replicas. This\nsynchronization may enlarge the range of historical records\nperceived by the new coordinator. Thus the historical records\nincurred by writes sent by the suspected coordinator may be\ncaught by the new coordinator during coordinator election and\nfailure recovery. This will avoid the reuse of sequence numbers\nand lower the probability of write duplication. Although we\ncan also provide a formula to measure the impact of coor-\ndinator election and failure recovery on write duplication it\ndepends on the specific processes of them, which can be very\ndifferent.\nD. Independence of Crash Failures and Message Delays\nAlthough we have released some assumptions in the com-\nputation of probability of write conflict and latency, we still\nassume that crash events of different nodes and message\ndelays between replicas are independent. In practice, they do\nnot always hold, since replica nodes and network links in\nmodern data centers usually share physical machines, routers\nand power devices and so on. However, the correlations among\nfailures and delays depend on the specific hardware and\nsoftware implementations. A reasonable solution is to acquire\nthe correlation factors among failures and delays by statistics\nfor established replication systems, and then append them to\nthe probability of crash failures and the message delays for\nmore accurate results.\nX. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we are concerned with providing a quan-\ntitative analysis of the 


relationship between consistency and\nlatency. Given that replicated state machines are widely used\nin modeling replication systems and there are several variants\nof RSM implementations, we first propose a generic model\ncalled RSM-d to give a unified description of major replication\nprotocols using RSMs. Second, on the basis of RSM-d, we\nbuild a probabilistic model for write conflicts that is one of the\nkey factors to cause inconsistency, and a probabilistic model\nfor characterizing latency as well. Third, we further define\na payoff model through combining the write conflict model\nand latency model from the perspective of a service provider.\nFinally, with Monte Carlo based simulation, we validate our\npresented results and show the effectiveness of our solution to\nmake tradeoff between consistency and latency to achieve the\nmaximum system benefit.\n11\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Richong Zhang and Yu\nTang for their discussions and feedback improved this work.\nThis work was supported partly by National Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China No. 61103031, No. 61272165 No. 2012AA011203 Author of National Excellent Doctoral\nDissertation of PR China, partly by Beijing Nova Program\nand partly by Program for New Century Excellent Talents in\nUniversity.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Amazon.com.

Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA.

Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
