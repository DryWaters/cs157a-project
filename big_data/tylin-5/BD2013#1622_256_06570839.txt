Very often, these novel\ntechniques exploit the computational resources available ‘in the\nnetwork’, i.e., leverage on storage units which are not passive\nentities supporting only read/write of data, but also can carry\nout some computations. This article accompanies an identically\ntitled tutorial at the IEEE International Symposium on Network\nCoding \(NetCod 2013 storage systems, where\nerasure codes designed by explicitly taking into account the\nnuances of distributed storage systems can provide significant\nperformance boosts.\nIndex Terms—Erasure codes, Storage systems Fault-tolerance,\nRepairability, Degraded reads, Data-insertion.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nErasure codes, originally invented for fault-tolerant com-\nmunication over lossy channels, have long been adapted for\nstorage centric applications and systems - starting from the\nCD technology. When a data object o is stored, it is first\nsplit into say k pieces o1, . . . , ok, which are then mapped\ninto n pieces x1, . . . , xn, n > k. These n encoded pieces\nx1, . . . , xn are then stored across the storage device. When\nfailures of the storage device occur some of the xi are lost.\nThe erasure code then ensures that o can be recovered from\nthe remaining xi similarly as in the case of a lossy channel,\nassuming enough xi are left. Under many practical settings,\nerasure codes then provide desirable levels of resilience while\nincurring significantly lower storage overhead with respect to\na naive strategy of replicating the data many-folds. In other\nwords, there are erasure codes with a good erasure recovery\ncapability and a higher rate than repetition codes.\nIn distributed storage systems, ranging from decentralized\npeer-to-peer systems to well administered data-centers, data is\nspread over multiple interconnected storage nodes: typically,\nevery encoded piece xi of an object o is stored in a distinct\nnode. Many of the storage nodes are augmented with comput-\ning power. This provides an opportunity of exploiting these\n‘storage network’ resources in order to achieve functionalities\nA Datta’s work was funded by A*STAR SERC TSRP Grant 102 158 0038.\nF. Oggier’s work was funded by the Nanyang Technological University under\nResearch Grant M58110049.\nand performance boosts not achievable in systems where the\nstorage nodes play a passive role. Erasure coding techniques\nwere not originally designed to either leverage on the network\nresources, nor were they intended to suit the needs of dis-\ntributed storage systems Instead, they were designed for the\nrecovery of the whole message \(or data object corresponding coding and decoding processes.\nWhile the recovery of the data object in case of failures\nremains a crucial concern \(that of fault-tolerance of\nnovel codes for distributed storage systems, among which \(not\nnecessarily by order of importance Repairability: When some nodes fail, the recovery\nability of the code protects the stored data. However over\ntime, more and more failures may occur, and data needs to\nbe replenished to maintain the level of redundancy across the\nstorage system. For example, if the data is simply replicated\nthree times, once a first node fails, a repair consists of copying\nthe data over a live node, so that three copies are again\navailable Note that the reason behind three copies is that once\nthe first one is gone, it is too dangerous to have only one copy\nleft, in case of another failure, there might not be enough time\nto safely copy the data Repairability encompasses a variety of\nsubproblems: how to detect a failure, when to trigger a repair,\nhow many live nodes are needed to be contacted to perform a\nrepair, how long does it take, how much bandwidth is needed,\nto name a few.\nb may still delay job processes,\nand actually form a key bottleneck. Suppose a job tries to\naccess a block of data which is not available, it will have to\nwait. Alternatively, it may compute the data it wanted to read\nby accessing different live nodes, which is called a degraded\nread. Degraded reads are somehow treated as repairs, however\nwith the following main differences: \(1 the storage medium, \(2 Decentralized encoding: In a theoretical model, one\njust assumes that the storage system is keeping encoded pieces\nof data objects. However, the encoding needs to be actually\ncomputed. This may happen in two different scenarios. \(1 network, bearing the\ncomputational burden of the encoding, and that of uploading\nFig. 1. Erasure coding techniques for different distributed storage system\nfunctions and processes: The data is inserted in the storage system. Pipelined\ninsertion leads to the insertion of several replicas, which are in turn 


archived\nusing a distributed encoding process, or encoded data can be directly inserted\nand computed using an in-network coding process. Once the data is erasure\nencoded, it needs to support repair, degraded reads fault-tolerance, without\ntoo much cost in storage overhead.\nnot only k pieces of data, but n > k of them. \(2 Most\nsystems store replicas of the data as long as it is “hot”, and\nmanipulated, e.g. for analytics purposes Once the data gets\n“cold”, it is archived using erasure codes. Typically a single\nnode carries out the encoding process per object. In both cases,\ndecentralizing the encoding process by distributing it across\nseveral nodes may speed it up, and reduce the network cost.\nThe above properties all help boost the performance of\na distributed storage system in different manners. Figure 1\nprovides a big picture of some of the core functionalities and\nprocesses within distributed storage systems, and how, many\nof these can benefit from novel coding techniques. While at\nthe moment, there is arguably no single code instance which\nachieves all these properties simultaneously, in this article we\nwill explore the individual novel codes in a piecemeal manner,\nwhich together lay the foundations for the search of codes that\nwould satisfy all the desirable properties together.\nSpecifically, we will look at codes designed to achieve good\nrepairability & degraded reads \(see Section III erasure coded data - either by converting already\nexisting replicated data, or immediately at the time of data\ninsertion \(Section IV tolerance against\nByzantine faults - where data is corrupted - either during the\nprocess of storage or repair is also becoming an important\ntopic of study, which we will briefly highlight.\nComplementing the coding theoretical results, we also dis-\ncuss some of the systems issues \(in Section V of, and in turn, harness, the above mentioned novel\ncode properties. Scalability as well as fault-tolerance needs\nmay dictate different degrees of distribution - spanning across\nmultiple storage nodes spread over a single data-center or\nmultiple data-centers \(both administered centrally by a single\ntrusted entity across multiple cloud service providers\nFig. 2. Peer-to-Peer storage systems design choices: Many of the tech-\nniques developed in the context of P2P storage are also relevant in other\nenvironments, while some others are not. For instance, centrally administered\ndata-centers exhibit significantly different workload and environment charac-\nteristics, and typical P2P issues such as user churn or trust relations, etc. are\nnot relevant.\n\(thus involving multiple trusted entities administering the\nsubparts decentralized, with no\ntrusted entity or global knowledge and control erasure coding based storage system\ndesigns which span the spectrum of distribution.\nII. ERASURE CODES FOR DISTRIBUTED STORAGE\nThe idea of adding some non-replication based redundancy,\ne.g. parity bits \(adding one bit which is the sum of all/some\ndata bits  Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks comprising of multiple disks. The parity based redundancy\nemployed, say in RAID-4, can be seen as a very simple erasure\ncode. More recently, specifically in RAID-6, variations of\nReed-Solomon erasure codes [33] are explicitly being adopted.\nErasure codes have also enjoyed a particularly high level\nof attention and usage in peer-to-peer \(P2P  then [3], [14]. Because of high churn \(membership\ndynamics of users going offline and coming back online a\ncritical issue with applying erasure codes in P2P systems is\nthe problem of maintaining a desirable level of redundancy\nefficiently. Several approaches \(which are not necessarily\nmutually exclusive the literature, which\nroughly define the design-space of P2P storage systems, as\nillustrated in Figure 2. The prominent aspects include: how\nmuch redundancy to initialize the system with [3], what\nstrategy to apply to replenish redundancy \(reactive: eager or\nlazy [3], [5], versus proactive [7 out\ngarbage collection in case unnecessary redundancy is created\nin the system [21], or how to choose the peers where the\nerasure coded data is stored \(based on history of availability,\ntrust, locality typically address the problem by\nconsidering the underlying coding technique as a “black box”,\nwhich takes k data symbols as input, outputs n symbols, which\nhave the property that any choice of k of them allows the data\nobject to be recovered. This property, called the MDS property,\nis the best recovery capability that an erasure can enjoy.\nAn alternative approach to address the issue of P2P storage\nsystem maintainability is to rethink the underlying coding\ntechnique itself. Several independent initiatives, prominently\non Regenerating codes [6], Pyramid codes [17] and Hier-\narchical codes [8] pioneered this line of work - that of\ndesigning new codes rather than assume a black box model.\nWhile Regenerating and Hierarchical codes focused on the\nrepairability issue, Pyramid codes were aimed at degraded\nreads rather than repairability, but implicitly the property\ncould be harnessed for improved repairability as well.\nIn the meanwhile, erasure codes have transcended P2P and\nRAID storage systems, and have become an integral part of\noff-the-shelf solutions such as 


CleverSafe [4] and Pivot3 [30],\nand of major industry players, including the new version of\nGoogle file system GFS  systems is now addressed to suit the different nuances\nof various storage systems, ranging from RAID and P2P\nstorage, to data centers.\nIII. REPAIRABLE ERASURE CODES\nThe lack of ability to repair lost data efficiently is arguably\none of the main reasons that slowed down the adoption of\nerasure codes in distributed storage systems. This is also\nprobably why most of the focus in designing new codes\nhas been on providing codes which enable repairs. Different\nfamilies of codes have targeted different desirable features of\nthe repair processes.\nRegenerating codes [6] are a family of codes designed to\nreduce the bandwidth needed to repair a node failure. Roughly\nspeaking, they consist of an erasure code \(typically MDS across different nodes, and of a network code,\nthat enables repairs. A trade-off between the storage capacity\nof the nodes and the amount of repair bandwidth needed was\nestablished in [6], and regenerating codes achieve this trade-\noff. They bring improvements in terms of bandwidth needed to\nperform a repair with respect to a naive strategy that consists\nof recovering the data object first. They however require a\nlarge number of live nodes to be contacted per repair.\nIn contrast, the ability to carry out a repair using a low\nnumber of nodes necessitate a non-MDS code, but may offer\nseveral benefits including lower number of I/O operations,\npossibility to carry out multiple repairs in parallel, reduction\nin the network bandwidth usage w.r. to the naive strategy representative classes of codes which require a small\nnumber of live nodes to carry out a repair process.\nA Pyramid/local reconstruction codes\nTake an erasure code that maps o = [o1, . . . , o8] to x =\n[x1 x11], where x is computed from o using an 8 × 11\n1Many of these cloud-centric and data-center based systems nevertheless\nleverage on the design principles matured while developing P2P systems.\n\(generator that is x = oG. The matrix G can be\nchosen so that\n[x1, . . . , x11] = [o1, . . . , o8, c1, c2, c3],\nthat is the first 8 columns of G form an identity matrix.\nConsider for example a Reed-Solomon code, which is an MDS\ncode, and thus any choice of 8 coefficients from x allows to\nrecover o.\nA Pyramid code can be built from this base code, by\nretaining the pieces o1, . . . , o8, and two of the other pieces\n\(without loss of generality, lets say, c2, c3 o8,\nand compute some more redundancy coefficients for each of\nthe two groups, which is done by picking a first symbol c1,1\ncorresponding to c1 by setting o5 = . . . = o8 = 0 and c1,2\ncorresponding to c1 with o1 o4 = 0.\nThis results in an erasure code which maps an object of\nlength 8 into 12 encoded pieces, looking like\n[o1, . . . , o8, c1,1, c1,2, c2, c3]\nwhere c1,1 + c1,2 is equal to the original code’s c1:\nc1,1 + c1,2 c1.\nThis example illustrates the idea behind the design of\nPyramid codes [17]. Redundancy is available in two forms:\n“local redundancy” c1,1 and c1,2 which can be used to repair\na lost block without accessing blocks outside the subgroup\n\(in this example, using 4 blocks for repair when only any\none of o1, . . . , o4, c1,1 fails, instead of requiring 8 blocks redundancy” \(c2 and c3 in this example move\nfurther up the Pyramid until repair is eventually completed.\nUse of local redundancy means that a small number of nodes is\ncontacted, which translates into a smaller bandwidth footprint,\nas well as fewer disk I/O operations. Furthermore, if multiple\nisolated \(in the hierarchy repaired\nindependently and in parallel. A new version of Pyramid\ncodes, where the coefficients used in the encoding have been\nnumerically optimized, namely Locally Reconstructable Codes\n[18] has more recently been proposed and is being used\n\(primarily for better degraded reads  Locally/Self-Repairable codes\nPyramid codes provide locality to the ‘data’, but not so\nmuch for the ‘parity blocks. Specifically, if any of the global\nparity blocks are to be repaired, then the repair cost would be\nequivalent to the naive strategy of repairing the base \(MDS thus optimized\nfor degraded reads, but not so much for repairs per say.\nSelf-repairing codes \(SRC  example shown in Fig\n3 2 per repair for up to\nn?1\n2 simultaneous failures, irrespective of which encoded\nblocks failed. Thus to say, all the encoded blocks are ‘locally\nrepairable’. The term ‘locally repairable’ is inspired from\nFig. 3 An example of self-repairing codes from [23]: the object o has length\n12, and is cut into k = 3 pieces, which are encoding as shown, resulting in\na code stored across n = 7 nodes. If one of these nodes fail, say N7, then it\ncan be repaired in three independent manners, each using only two other live\nnodes. This code can repair any three simultaneous failures, where each repair\nprocess is carried out by contacting \(distinct sets of only two live nodes.\nlocally decodable and locally correctable codes, and was\ncoined in a subsequent work 28]. Other families of locally\nrepairable codes based on projective geometric construction\n\(Projective 


Self-repairing Codes   been\nproposed. Note that achieving a very small repair degree has\nadvantages in terms of repair time parallelization, I/O accesses\nand bandwidth, however, it also affects other code parameters\n\(such as its rate 13].\nC. Security issues: Byzantine fault-tolerance\nSince most of these novel repair approaches carry out\nthe process in a decentralized manner with only a partial\ninformation, they are susceptible to poisoning attacks during\nthe repair process, which may affect not only a specific repair\noperation, but also any future operations involving the affected\nblock\(s  regenerating codes, taking into account such Byzantine\nfaults during the repair operations was carried out in 24], and\nthere has in the recent years been a growing interest \(e.g.,\n[15], [31 related to the repair process\nof erasure coded storage.\nIV. CREATING ERASURE CODED REDUNDANCY\nWhen data is stored using replication, the redundant data\ncan be created using a pipelining process [12] so that no\nsingle node becomes a bottleneck: the source passes the data\nto a first storage node, which, in addition to locally keeping\na copy, relays the same to a second node, and so on. There\nis no obvious analogous mechanism to create erasure coded\nredundancy in a distributed manner. However, the local/self-\nrepairability property can be exploited not only to replace lost\nFig. 4. In-network redundancy generation for a locally \(self code\nof length 7.\nredundancy, but also to create the redundancy to start with by\npursuing an ‘in-network decentralized encoding process.\nA. In-network encoding for fast data insertion\nLet us consider the locally repairable code of Fig 3. In Fig 4\nwe show an in-network redundancy generation example for\nthis code. The encoded pieces at the seven nodes are ci for\ni = 1...7. Traditionally, a single node \(the source centrally\ncomputes all these encoded blocks and transfers them to seven\ndifferent storage nodes, making the outgoing bandwidth at the\ncentral node a bottleneck. Alternatively, the source can upload\na subset of this information \(namely c1, c2, c3 in this example c2,\nto node 4, which computes and stores c4 = c1 + c2. The rest\nof the nodes compute the fragments c6 = c2+c3 c5 = c4+c6\nand c7 = c3 + c4 in a similar manner.\nNote that the creation of c5 and c7 depends on the a priori\nexistence of c4 and c6. Although at a first glance it might\nseem that symbols c5 and c7 can thus be created only some\ntime in the future after the generation of c4 and c6, practical\nimplementations can overcome this restriction by allowing\nnodes 4 and 6 to start forwarding the first generated bytes\nof c4 and c6 to nodes 5 and 7 in a pipelined way, similarly to\nthe mechanism described above for replication. By doing so,\nblocks c4 to c7 can be generated quasi-simultaneously once\nnodes 1 to 3 receive their blocks from the source node.\nThis example demonstrates how local repairability can be\nexploited to generate the in-network redundancy generation,\nby identifying encoded block dependencies to generate a\nsuitable flow of information as depicted in Figure 4. However,\nobtaining such a flow graph, scheduling the flow of infor-\nmation and orchestrating the decentralized coding accordingly\nfor any arbitrary locally repairable code is not trivial. More\ndetails on these issues, as well as the resulting trade-offs such\nas higher usage of network resources for better data insertion\nthroughput can be found in [25].\nB. Rapid conversion of replicated data to erasure coded\nredundancy\nOften, when data is first acquired/instered in a system, it is\nstored using replication, and subsequently it is archived using\nerasure coding when it becomes ‘cold’, i.e., it is accessed\ninfrequently Replication is preferred for the initial phase, since\nFig. 5. An example of migration of replicated data into an erasure coded\narchive \(e.g. as done in HDFS-RAID [1 across boxes denote data \(labels indicate the actual amount denotes the replicas that are\ndiscarded once the archival finishes, and the symbol ? denotes an encoding\noperation. We see that this process requires a total of five network transfers.\nFig. 6. Decentralized encoding: An example of migration of replicated\ndata into an erasure coded archive \(e.g. as done in RapidRAID 26 labels indicate the actual amount finishes, and\nthe symbol ? denotes an encoding operation. We see that this process requires\nonly four network transfers \(instead of five used in the traditional approach\ndepicted in Fig. 5 upload/download bandwidth limit, then\nthe decentralized coding process can, besides saving network traffic also yield\nsignificant speed-up.\nthe replicas can then be accessed in parallel - yielding higher\nread throughput, or computational tasks utilizing the data can\nbe assigned to the least loaded of the replicas etc. Typically,\nthe whole encoding process is treated as an atomic process,\nand is centrally carried out, as is the case, for instance in\nHDFS-RAID [1]. This means, one node first needs to collect\nall the relevant data blocks, and then carry out the coding.\nThis is illustrated in Fig 5.\nGiven the presence of multiple replicas 


of the data, an\ninteresting alternative is to decompose the hitherto atomic\nencoding process, and carry it out in a distributed fashion.\nThis premise was explored recently, resulting in two new code\nfamilies, namely RapidRAID [26], and a follow-up variant\n[27] where pieces of the original data are present among the\nencoded pieces. Fig. 6 provides a high-level sketch of the\ndistributed coding process utilizing the existence of replicas.\nV. REPRESENTATIVE ‘REPAIRABLE’ STORAGE SYSTEMS\nWhile there was still some dilemma \(at least in the public\ndomain, though there were likely several works in progress\nin the industry codes in data-center\nenvironments [35], DiskReduce [11] was one of the pioneering\nworks which integrated erasure coding with the popular open-\nsource Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS mature version implemented by Facebook,\nnamely HDFS-RAID [1]. HDFS-RAID essentially uses a\nhybrid strategy for achieving redundancy, namely replication\nand erasure coding, and furthermore, it supports two kinds of\nerasure coding - namely XOR based parity and Reed-Solomon\ncoding, which provide one or arbitrary number of parities,\nrespectively. Depending on how actively the data is being\nread, the degree of replication is reduced, as erasure coded\nredundancy is introduced in the system to achieve comparable\nfault-tolerance but as significantly lower storage overhead. In\nthe meanwhile, several other major players including Google\nand Microsoft have also integrated erasure coding in their pro-\nprietary file/storage systems. Other commercial data-storage\ncentric applications and services using erasure codes include\nproducts from CleverSafe, or Pivot3. HDFS-RAID separates\nthe data access from repair process. The former is carried out\nin a fault tolerant manner by carrying out a decoding process\nif any data block is unavailable or corrupted. The latter is\ncarried out periodically by a background daemon process, or\nby manual triggers from the system administrator. The repair\nprocess requires to carry out decoding/re-encoding.\nBarring Microsoft’s Azure system [10], all the other sys-\ntems mentioned above use traditional erasure code, and the\nfocus is only on achieving fault-tolerance while incurring\nlow storage overhead. As discussed previously, Azure de-\nploys an optimized variation of Pyramid codes, named Local\nReconstruction Code [18], which allows reconstruction of\nunavailable data blocks using a small number of other data and\nparity blocks, providing better degraded read performance with\nrespect to what could be achieved if MDS codes were to be\nused, where a complete decoding becomes necessary even if a\nsingle data block is missing. Though not specifically meant for\nrepairs, the reconstruction property of Local Reconstruction\nCodes can be exploited to achieve better repairs in some fault-\nscenarios involving data blocks. A very recent work, XORbas\n[34] essentially does so. Another recent work explores the use\nof a collaborative regenerating code to provide recovery of\nmultiple failures [20] in HDFS.\nThough this article primarily explores novel erasure codes,\nit is worth noting that engineering alternatives to the repair\nproblem using traditional codes is also possible. An example\nis our HDFS-RAID compliant implementation called CORE\n\(Cross-object redundancy based  as shown in Fig 7 objects - which primarily provides redundancy for fault-\ntolerance, while using HDFS-RAID’s XOR parity to create\nanother parity block for \(both data and parity good repairability\neven in presence of multiple failures.2\nWhile there has been a flurry of systems research though\na lot of ground still remains to be covered with HDFS, and\n2[20] has incidentally an identical name and addresses the same problem\nof multiple failures repair, but the approach is fundamentally different, and\ninherits both the advantages and the drawbacks of regenerating codes.\nFig. 7. In this example of cross-object coding, a horizontal \(9,6 used per object, and XOR parity is computed on data as\nwell as parity blocks across three objects.\naimed at data-center environments, there have also been a few\nprototypes which look at a higher level of abstraction namely\ndistributing data across multiple cloud services. DepSky [2]\nwas an early system which, analogous to the data-center\nrelated works \(e.g. DiskReduce and HDFS-RAID 16] has incorporated\nregenerating coding for repairs in such multi-cloud settings.\nVI. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nCodes achieving low degree repairs naturally realize recon-\nstruction of data blocks, which can be leveraged for good\ndegraded reads, and to a certain extent the converse is also true.\nIn that sense, these two functionalities can be simultaneously\nachieved by many of the novel codes - particularly local/self-\nrepairing codes \(but not regenerating codes coding technique to create\nerasure coded data on the fly when data is being introduced\nin the system leveraged on the local repairability property.\nThus, in order to realize a system achieving all the processes\noutlined in Fig 1, the prominent outstanding issue is a code\nwhich realizes good repairs and degraded reads, but simulta-\nneously achieves RapidRAID like mechanism to benefit from\nthe existence of replicas in order to distribute and accelerate\nthe encoding process.\nA code with all these desirable properties is the 


foremost\nopen issue in our opinion. For applicability in wide range of\nenvironments \(e.g. decentralized and P2P settings small fraction of the stored\ndata likely needs to be manipulated and mutated, mechanisms\nto support efficient updates to mutable content is another\ninteresting aspect to be further explored. Likewise, depending\non the kind of data and applications, e.g., multimedia data,\nmarrying ideas from multi-resolution coding with those of\nrepairable codes poses another obvious yet interesting frontier.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Apache.org.

Depending on the \nallocation of signal processing and data delivery functions \nbetween the GSS’s and the INOC7, different intermediate \ndata types with vastly different quantities would be sent \nfrom the GSS’s to the INOC, which in turn would send the nprocessed mission data products to the MOC’s of the user \nmissions. \n \nLatency Requirements of Mission Data Types – to quantify \nthe service classes offered by SCaN to the different mission \ndata types, we assume the following latency requirements \nthat are based on the draft ScaN Service Requirement \nDocument:   \n1 Audio/video data – 2 seconds.   \n2. Engineering telemetry – 5 seconds.   \n3. Quick-look science – 30 minutes n4.

For those missions we use the following \nECC assumptions:   \n1. For DSN missions, we assume Low Density Parity \nCheck LDPC rate R, the coded symbol rate \n\(including quantization assume 50% of the \nmissions will use rate 7/8 LDPC code and 50% of \nthe missions will use concatenated code The \naverage code rate Rc = 0.58, the average codeword \nlength CW = 4500 bits, and the average \nquantization level Q = 4 bits. For a data rate R, the \ncoded symbol rate \(including quantization nNetwork delay estimations – in the ScaN network signal \nprocessing chain and data delivery process, various latency \nfactors are introduced and SCaN has to make sure that the \noverall latency will meet the mission data delivery \nrequirements.  The following are the key latency \ncontributions in the ScaN end-to-end traffic flow n1. Store-and-Forward delay: this is the buffering \ndelay for a mission data type introduced at each nnetwork node according to the service class \n\(priority the store-and-forward mechanism to \nregulate the network data flow, to control the end-\nto-end delay and network resource utilization, and \nto ensure expedient delivery of mission data \naccording to the respective latency requirements.   \n\t t t t t t t t t t

Codeword buffering delay – we assume the \ncodeword frame synchronization mechanism will \nrequire 3 code frames to acquire and to confirm \nframe sync.  Let R denote the data rate.  Thus the \ncodeword buffering delay for DSN missions and \nSN/NEN missions are 3x2048/R and 3x4500/R \nrespectively \(in unit of seconds 


Frame buffering delay – we assume a Space Link \nExtension \(SLE acquired and confirmed in one frame.  \nThus the frame buffering delay is 10240/R \(in unit \nof seconds Ground transmission delay – from prior statistics \nfor DSN data delivery over the NISN lines, we \nobserve that the long-haul latency between DSN \nsites and JPL Central is approximately 2 times the \npropagation delay.  As ground transmission latency \nis a small fraction compared to the other delays, we \nuse the rough estimation of two times propagation \ndelay to model the ground transmission delay.   \n \nUsing the Straight-Forward Leveling Scheme we estimate \nthe link sizes of the network paths of the four ISE options \nfor the “base” case and high” case traffic scenarios, both \nfor bulk science latency requirements of 1 hour and 8 hours nrespectively.  The aggregated WAN bandwidths of the four \nISE options for both cases are given in Tables 1 and 2.   \n \n \nTable 1: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Straight-Forward \nLeveling Scheme \n \n \nTable 2: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Eight Hours, Straight-Forward \nLeveling Scheme \n \nSimilarly we apply the 2-State Markov Leveling Scheme, \nand the aggregated WAN bandwidths of the four ISE \noptions for the base and high cases are given in Table 3 \n\(with bulk science latency of 1 hour with bulk \nscience latency of 8 hours Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps nTable 4: Aggregated WAN Bandwidths \(Gbps Scheme \n \nTo validate the accuracy of the leveling schemes, we choose \nthe DSN’s GSS-MOC links for the ISE option-1 for the case \nwhen the bulk science latency requirement is one hour, and \ncompare the bandwidth estimates generated by the Straight-\nForward Leveling Scheme and those generated by direct \nsimulation using MACHETE10.

For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the GSS-INOC links are real-\ntime bit streams and the link sizes are driven by the ninstantaneous aggregated data rates.   \n\t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6. The WAN bandwidths of ISE-3 and ISE-4 are \nmuch higher than those of ISE-1 and ISE-2.   \n \n \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
