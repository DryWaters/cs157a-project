Kylin is based on bulk synchronization\nprocessing\(BSP processing systems, Kylin is\ndifferent from these systems in two-fold. First, Kylin cooperates\nwith HBase to achieve scalable data manipulation. Second,\nWe propose three techniques to optimize the performance of\nKylin The proposed techniques are pull messaging, lazy vertex\nloading and vertex-weighted partitioning. We demonstrate\nKylin outperforms other BSP-based systems, i.e. Hama and\nGiraph, in the experiments.\nKeywords-graph data processing, graph data partition, load\nbalancing, pull messaging, dynamic loading\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBulk synchronous parallel \(BSP processing. There are many\nopen source implementations like Giraph [1] and Hama [2].\nAlthough it is popular there are several problems in current\nsystems. First, the synchronization phase becomes the per-\nformance bottleneck if the massive message passing among\nthe workers is not handled carefully. Second, existing sys-\ntems use hashing to distribute graph data to the distributed\nstorage, and hence suffers lack of data locality during data\nprocessing. Finally, existing BSP-based systems use Hadoop\nfile system \(HDFS storage system. HDFS is a\nfile-based system and does not provide any data scheme\nand API for data management As a result, users have to\nimplement various input format to read the records from files\nfor processing Moreover, HDFS does not support indexing\nmechanism so we can not retrieve a specified set of data\nefficiently from HDFS.\nTo address the above problems, we develop Kylin, an\noptimized BSP data processing system built on HBase.\nThe reason for choosing Hbase as our storage system is\nthat HBase provides very useful data management features,\nincluding indexing for efficient data retrieval and structured\ndata scheme. These features substantially alleviate our de-\nvelopment effort in building the Kylin system.\nWe also devise three optimization techniques to improve\ndata partitioning, message passing and memory management\nin BSP data processing: \(1 partition, \(2 unnecessary\nmessage passing, and \(3 unneeded vertices into\nmemory.\nThere are four contributions of this paper. First,\nwe develop Kylin, an optimized BSP framework in\nHadoop/HBase. To the best of our knowledge, our work is\nthe first effort to develop the BSP framework on HBase.\nSecond,we propose three optimization techniques, vertex-\nweighted partitioning Pull messaging and lazy vertex load-\ning, to improve the performance of BSP data processing.\nThird, we develop a comprehensive benchmark suite to\nevaluate the existing BSP systems and Kylin. Fourth, we\nconduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance\nof existing BSP systems and Kylin. Kylin outperforms\nexisting systems from 1.2x to 5x for different applications.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II\ndiscusses some related works and highlight the differences\nbetween our work and existing work. Section III describes\nthe software architecture of the Kylin BSP framework we de-\nvelop on HBase. Section IV presents the three optimization\ntechniques we propose. Section V reports our experiment\nresults, and Section VI gives some concluding remarks.\nII. RELATED WORKS\nPregel [3] is a framework based on bulk synchronization\nparallel model\(BSP architecture.\nIn this architecture a master orchestrates a set of worker to\ncomplete a computation job. The job is divided into tasks and\neach worker process some tasks. The job completes when\nall tasks finish. In the system initialization phase of Pregel,\nevery worker registers itself to the master, therefore, the\nmaster knows the IP and the port number of every worker.\nThen, to process a job the input files are divided into splits\nand the master assigns each split to a worker. The worker\nreads graph information from the split and build the vertices.\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 193\nA vertex is a computation unit in Pregel. User defines the\ncompute function on the vertex for data processing. A job in\nPregel consists of several supersteps. In each superstep, all\nvertices perform the compute function independently. Once\nall vertices finish, they synchronize and communicate with\neach other to exchange data. Another superstep begins after\nthis synchronization. The job finish as soon as all vertices\nvote to halt. Giraph [1] and Hama [2] are an open source\nimplementation of Pregel.\nAlthough Kylin is also based on the BSP model, its\nimplementation strategy and optimization techniques distin-\nguish Kylin from 


other existing systems. We highly optimize\nthe BSP engine in Kylin to achieve better performance, in\nterms of data partitioning, message passing and memory\nmanagement.\nIII. ARCHITECTURE\nFigure 1. The architecture of Kylin\nFigure 1 depicts the software architecture of Kylin. Graph\ndata stored in the NoSQL database will be fed into the\npartition manager, which performs vertex-oriented disjoint\npartitioning of the graph. The resulting partition information\nwill also be stored in the NoSQL database. Kylin employs a\nmaster-slave architecture for easy management of superstep\nexecutions as suggested in Pregel [3]. The workflow of Kylin\nis described as follows.\nStep 1: A client sends a request to the master. The master\ngenerates worker tasks from the request and then distributes\nthe tasks to the workers based on a pre-specified partitioning\nstrategy.\nStep 2: After receiving a task from the master, a worker\nloads its portion of the graph assigned by the master from\nthe NoSQL database.\nStep 3: The master and the workers enter the Bulk Syn-\nchronous Processing supersteps as described in the follow-\ning. In each superstep, each worker iterates over all vertices\nin its local partition and executes an user defined compute\nfunction. The workers exchange messages to move graph\ndata that are accessed across partitions. At the end of each\nsuperstep, the master coordinates the synchronization among\nthe workers before entering the next superstep. The iteration\nof the supersteps terminates when all vertices become non-\nactive. Finally, the workers store the computation result back\nto the NoSQL database.\nIn the following subsections, we describe each module in\nmore details.\nA. Partition Manager\nThe partition manager is responsible of partitioning the\ngraph and storing the partition information into the NoSQL\ndatabase. Each worker consults the partition information\nfrom the NoSQL database and loads graph data according to\nthe partition information. If the number of workers change\neither due to machine failure or addition of new workers,\nthe partition manager re-partitions the graph to re-balance\nthe workload.\nB. Query Manager\nThe query manager serves multiple purposes in our ar-\nchitecture: 1 to query processors with parameters specified by the\nclient and 3 The\nquery manager and query processor communicate via a\ncoordination system to perform superstep synchronization.\nEmploying a coordination system makes it easier to syn-\nchronize between supersteps and also ease the burden of the\nmaster.\nC. Data Graph and Data Loader\nA client can provide parameters to the master to specify\nwhether the computation would require loading the whole\ngraph or only a particular sub-graph. The data loader can\nthen load a portion of the data graph determined by both the\npartition information and client provided parameters. The\ngraph data stored in the NoSQL database is structured as\nan adjacency list. A key-value pair in the NoSQL database\nrepresents a vertex and its neighbor.\nD. Query Processor\nThe query processor is the place where vertex compute\nprogram is executed. Each query processor keeps track of\na queue of active vertices, which was gradually emptied as\neach vertex program execution completes. It also send mes-\nsages and pull requests to other workers for the computation\non the vertices at the partition boundaries After completing\nexecution of its partition, the query processor consults the\ncoordination system to get current state from master in order\nto synchronize with other workers. We will discuss the pull\nrequests and dynamic pull model in the next section.\nWe use HBase as the noSQL database in our implemen-\ntation. However other noSQL database could also be used\nas the backend store. We choose HBase because it comes\nwith a mature coordination system, Zookeeper.\n194\nIV. OPTIMIZATIONS\nIn this section, we present three optimization techniques\nwe devise for efficient bulk synchronous model, including\npull messaging, lazy vertex loading, and vertex-weighted\npartitioning.\nA. Pull Messaging\nKylin uses a pull model for message passing; that is, a\nvertex pulls its neighbors’ data when that vertex needs to\nperform computation. Compared to the push model which\nis used in Giraph and Hama, the pull model can eliminate\nsignificant amount of unnecessary messages. There are two\nsources of unnecessary message passing. The first is that\nthe sender may send duplicated messages to the receivers.\nA message is duplicated because it has the same content\nas the last message from the same sender. A vertex will\ncontinually send duplicated messages if that vertex’s state\ndoes not change significantly. For example, in the PageRank\napplication, even after the page rank of a vertex converges,\nthat vertex will still send duplicated messages to its neigh-\nbors in subsequent supersteps. Another form of unnecessary\nmessage passing occurs as the overhead of broadcast oper-\nation. The broadcast operation is unnecessary for vertices\nresiding in the same machine because the neighboring data\ncan be accessed in memory.\nFor broadcast messages transmitted across machines, pull\nmodel can also help reduce the message size from O\(E V illustrated in figure 2.\nFigure 2. For machine 2, vertex 3,4, 5 need information from vertex 1 and\nvertex 2 on machine 1. The broadcast operation would result in 6 messages.\nWhereas the pull model requires only 2 messages.\nIn Kylin, a set of active vertices decide whether to\nperform computation or not according to its own change\nof state in every superstep. An active vertex that will\nperform computation needs to pull all it neighbors data\nbefore the computation. For efficient data processing, we\npull the neighbors data in batches so 


that we can perform\ndata transmission and computation in a pipelined manner as\ndescribed below. We divide the active vertices into several\nsubsets. In each pipeline stage, we retrieve the neighbors\ndata of a subset active vertices. An active vertex that has\nall its neighbors data can start the computation. At the same\ntime we can retrieve the next batch of neighbors data for\nanother subset active vertices. Such pipeline processing can\noverlap computation and communication effectively to hide\nthe communication overhead.\nIn order to minimize the total execution time of such\npipeline processing, we need to solve an important problem:\nhow to find a set of active vertices to compute in a pipeline\nstage? The number of selected active vertices should be as\nlarge as possible so that we can finish the computation for\nmore vertices at a time. On the other hand, the retrieved\nneighbors data cannot exceed certain amount due to network\nbandwidth constraint.\nWe formulate this problem as a maximum active subset\nproblem, which is stated as follows. Given a set of active\nvertices and their corresponding neighbors, find a maximum\nsubset of active vertices such that the number of neighbors\nof that subset is within a given bound. Note that we exclude\nactive vertices in the neighbors, that is, if there is an active\nvertex u whose neighbor v is also an active vertex, we\nremove v from the neighbor set, because we do not need\nto transmit the data of v.\n1 and their neighbors as a bipartite graph. Note\nthat the edges in our model are undirected. Given a graph\nG V,E V1 ? V2, E V2\nrepresents the neighbors of the active vertices V1 and E?\nis a subset of E. E? consists of edges between V1 and V2\nin the original graph G. We define maximum active subset\nproblem as follows.\nDefinition 1: Given a bipartite graph G? = \(V1 ?V2, E that the set of neighbors of ?, ?, is at most of\nsize l.\nWe next show that the maximum active subset problem is\nNP-hard.\n2 Given a bipartite\ngraph G? = \(V1 ? V2, E at least k, such that |?|\nis at most l, where ? is the set of neighbors of ??\nTheorem 1: The decision version of the maximum active\nsubset problem is NP-hard.\nProof: We reduce the maximum independent set prob-\nlem [4] to the maximum active subset problem. We first\nshow the if direction; that is, if we have a positive in-\nstance of maximum independent set, we have a positive\ninstance of maximum active subset. Given an instance\nof maximum independent set problem, we have a graph\nG = \(V,E a bipartite graph G? = \(V ? V,E u, v v, u subset ? in the left hand side of the bipartite graph\nto be I and the neighbor set ? in the right hand side to be\nV ? I. By setting k = n and l = |V |?n, we have a positive\ninstance of maximum active subset problem, since we find\na set ? with size at least k and its neighbor set with size at\nmost l.\n195\nFor the only if direction suppose we have a bipartite graph\nG? = \(X ? Y,E l. Furthermore, ? is the active set\nand ? is the corresponding neighbors. Note that ? ? ? =.\nWe then have an independent set I = ? of graph G?? = \(??\n?, E u, v u, v Approximation algorithm: Since the maximum active\nsubset problem is computationally intractable \(NP-hard we\ndevise an approximation algorithm to solve this problem.\nOur approximation algorithm is based on the optimal algo-\nrithm that finds the maximum independent set on a bipartite\ngraph [5]. Algorithm 1 shows the approximation algorithm.\nWe describe the procedures of Algorithm 1 in details. The\ninput is a bipartite graph G = \(V1 ? V2, E FindMaxIndependent function in line 1  function FindMaxIndependent is a maximum\nindependent set I. We then adjust I to obtain the final answer\n?. I is composed of two sets, L and R, which are the subsets\nof V1 and V2 respectively. We initially set ? to be L\(line\n3 line 4-9 arbitrary neighbor x\nof y and add x into ? if x /? ?. If x is already in ?, we just\nskip y and choose the next member of R. After iterating\nall members of R, we obtain the approximated maximum\nactive subset ?.\nAlgorithm 1 Find approximated active subset\nRequire: A bipartite graph G = \(V1 ? V2, E I = FindMaxIndependentSet\(G SelectOneNeighbor\(y approximation bound of Algo-\nrithm 1.\nTheorem 2: Algorithm 1 is a 1d -approximation algorithm\nfor the maximum active subset problem, where d is the\naverage degree of a vertex in the bipartite graph.\nProof: Given a bipartite graph G = \(V1 ? V2, E assume that the optimal solution of maximum\nactive subset problem is ? and |?| = p†. We have p? ? p†,\nsince maximum active subset is a special case of maximum\nindependent set by constraining all vertices in V1 Suppose\nthe output of Algorithm 1 is ?? and |??| = p. We have\np ? 1dp?, because in line 5 of Algorithm 1, in 


the worst\ncase, on average, there are d vertices of I that choose the\nsame vertex x. Therefore, the size of I will shrink to 1d . As\na result, we have p ? 1dp? ? 1np†. That is, the size of ??\nobtained by Algorithm 1 is at least 1d of the optimal solution\nto the maximum active subset problem.\nB. Lazy Vertex Loading\nKylin provides a lazy vertex loading strategy to load\ndata into memory. When using lazy loading mode, some\nspecified vertices will be loaded into memory initially. These\ninitially loaded vertices are specified by users. Then in\nthe following super steps, only the vertices which receive\nmessages to compute will be loaded into memory As a\nresult, we eliminate memory loading of vertices that do\nnot need to perform computation or do not receive any\nmessages \(which means these vertices will not be reached\nby the initial vertices the memory\nresource more efficiently. Note that for applications that need\nthe whole graph to compute, e.g Max value propagation [3]\nor PageRank [7], all graph data will be loaded into memory.\nAlthough lazy vertex loading can avoid loading unneeded\nvertices into memory, it may cause significant performance\ndegradation if we do not manage the I/O carefully. Due to\nthe random access nature of graph processing, lazy vertex\nloading may cause random disk accessing while loading\nthe vertices into memory. To address this problem, we\ntake advantage of the data layout management in HBase\nto make lazy vertices loading efficient. We use vertex ID\nas the key to store graph data in HBase. In the lazy vertex\nloading mode, the ID of a vertex will be inserted into a\nlist if that vertex is not loaded in the memory and it has\nmessages to process. In the synchronization phase between\neach superstep, we first sort the list storing the vertices ID\nin ascending order, and load those vertices accordingly by\nHBase APIs. Since HBase stores data with contiguous key\nin a HTable, loading vertices in the ascending order of vertex\nID will result in sequential disk accesses to a HTable, which\nin turn significantly improves the I/O performance of lazy\nvertex loading.\nC. Vertex-weighted Partitioning\nWe formulate the vertex-weighted partitioning problem as\nfollows. Given a graph G = \(V,E quantity\nvertex weight ?v of a vertex v ? V to be the number of\nedges adjacent to v. A partition P is a subset of V . An n\npartition P of G is a set of partitions: P = {Pi|i = 1, n},\nand Pi ? Pj = ?i \b= j and V = ?iPi. A cut-edge is an\nedge whose end nodes belong to two different partitions.\nThat is , for a cut-edge e = \(u, v we have u ? Pi and\nv ? Pj , i \b= j. We define ?ij to be the set of cut-edges\nbetween two partition Pi and Pj n196\nA vertex-weighted partitioning is a n-partition PV of V\nsatisfying the following two conditions.\n•\n?\nv?Pi ?v =\n?\nu?Pj ?u?i \b= j\n•\n?\ni,j |?ij | is minimized , ?i, j ? {1, · · · , n}, i \b= j\nThe first condition means the weight of each partition is\nbalanced. The second condition is to minimize the total\nnumber of cut-edges. The objective of vertex-weighted parti-\ntioning problem is to minimize number of cut-edges between\npartitions while keeping the summation of all in-degrees in a\npartition balanced. This graph partitioning problem is a well-\nknown NP-complete problem [8]. We use an open source\ngraph partitioner, METIS 8], to implement our vertex-\nweighted partitioning.\nV. EXPERIMENTS\nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the per-\nformance of Kylin. We first examine the benefits of the\nproposed optimization techniques and then we combine all\noptimizations to obtain the overall performance. We compare\noverall performance of Kylin with two existing BSP systems:\nApache Hama and Apache Giraph.\nA. Setup\nThe experimental environment is a 16-node cluster. Eight\nmachines of them are Intel Xeon E5504 machines and each\nhas 13 gigabyte RAM. The other eight machines are Intel\nXeon E5520 machines and each has 23 gigabyte RAM. We\nrun each application 10 times and use the average execution\ntime as the performance metric. The version of Hama we\nused is 0.6.0 and the version of Giraph is 1.0.0. We use\nHadoop 1.0.2 to be the based system of Hama and Giraph.\nKylin is implemented on HBase 0.94.6-cdh4.3.0. The graph\npartitioner METIS is 5.1.0.\nWe collected four real world social networks data to\nbe the input graph data of of our benchmark suite. The\nfour social networks are Youtube, Flicker, LiveJournal and\nOrkut. The four graph data are published by Mislove [9]\nin the anonymous form. In the four graph data, a vertex\nrepresents a person and the edges stand for the social\nrelationships among the persons. Table I summarize the\nnumber of nodes and edges of the four social graphs.\nSocial Networks Nodes \(millions millions 3.01\nTable I\nTHE NUMBERS OF NODES AND EDGES OF FOUR SOCIAL NETWORKS\nTo evaluate the performance of Kylin, we collect and\ndevelop a set of representative graph algorithms to be the\nbenchmark suite. Most of the algorithms are suggested by [3]\nand some of them are used in social network analysis [10],\n[11]. The benchmark suite includes the following seven\napplications: Maxvalue, N-neighbors, PageRank, Bipartite\nmatching, Single source shortest path, Inference spreading,\nLabel propagation.\nB. Pull model\nIn this experiment, we demonstrate the efficiency of pull\nmessaging on PageRank application. Table II compares\npush and pull mode on Kylin for different social networks. It\nshows that in small graph e.g. YouTube, we can not benefit\nfrom pull messaging However, for large graph like Orkut,\nwe can achieve more than 2x speedup.\nNetworks Push\(seconds Pull\(seconds

The partitioning strategy is vertex-\nweighted partitioning. Table III shows the results of running\nlazy vertex loading mode and normal mode. Normal mode\nloads the whole graph initially. The performance gain is\nsignificant if the subgraph involved in the computation\nis related small to the whole graph, e.g. the Orkut case.\nHowever, the performance becomes slightly worse for small\ngraphs because of the extra overhead of data loading. The\noverhead of data loading in each superstep becomes signif-\nicant especially for data with small size.\nNetworks Whole\(seconds seconds 26.135\nLiveJournal 71.008 61.124\nOrkut 175.784 28.133\nTable III\nWHOLE GRAPH AND LAZY VERTEX LOADING OF Nneighbors\nD. Partitioning strategies\nWe compare three different partitioning strategies in terms\nof number of cut-edges, number of nodes and number of\nedges of each partition. The compared strategies are hash\npartitioning, node-based partitioning and vertex-weighted\npartitioning.\nFigure 3 shows the performance of each application on\nKylin with different partitioning strategies for Orkut. It\ndemonstrates that vertex-weighted outperforms node-based\nin most of cases. When comparing with Hash, vertex-\nweighted partitioning has slightly worse performance for\napplications whose runtime are less than 200 seconds This\n197\n 100\n 200\n 300\n 400\n 500\n 600\n 700\n 800\n 900\n 1000\nMaxvalue N-steps Pagerank Bipartite SSSP Inference Label\nS\nec\non\nds\nApplications\nVW\nNode\nHash\nFigure 3. Different partition strategies for various applications on Kylin\nis because for small applications, data transmission is not\nthe bottleneck, so the balance of local computation becomes\nthe most important factor of performance. Since Hash can\nachieve the most balanced load it outperforms vertex-\nweighted partitioning. On the other hand, for applications\nsuffer heavy data traffics e.g. PageRank, vertex-weighted\noutperforms Hash significantly. This is because vertex-\nweighted achieves better data locality than Hash strategy\nand prevents remote message passing. Meanwhile, vertex-\nweighted also achieves load balancing by METIS.\nE.

The\nx-axis represents different kinds of applications and the y-\naxis represents the job execution time in seconds in each\nsubfigure. We first observe that in small social network,\ne.g. Youtube, Hama outperforms Giraph significantly. On the\nother hand, Giraph is more efficient than Hama to process\nlarge graphs e.g. Orkut. Kylin is efficient in either large\nor small graphs. For small graph, Kylin achieves 2x-5x\nperformance improvement comparing with Hama. For large\ngraph, Kylin outperforms Giraph by 1.2x-2x. Note that we\ntake the best performance of each application by applying\nsuitable optimizations. For example, we apply lazy vertex\nloading for Nneighbors application, but for PageRank. we\nload all the vertices initially.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nWe propose Kylin, an efficient and scalable BSP system\nfor graph data processing. We optimize Kylin by three\ntechniques: pull messaging, lazy vertex loading and vertex-\nweighted partitioning. We compare Kylin with two existing\nBSP system, Hama and Giraph. With the proposed optimiza-\ntions, Kylin outperforms Hama and Giraph up to 5x and 2x\nperformance improvement respectively.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work is supported by National Science Council of\nTaiwan under grant number NSC101-2221-E-001-004-MY3.\nREFERENCES\n[1 Giraph,” http://giraph.apache.org/.\n[2] “Hama,” http://hama.apache.org/.\n[3] G.

the flow structure becomes more steady,\nespecially in the bow shock. This behavior was predicted\nwell with the CFD, and average surface pressures agreed well\nwith the WTT. The area of greatest deviation between the\ncodes was along the model shoulder and at the model nose.\nThe differences at the nose are attributed to differences in\nentrainment, entrapment, and recirculation being simulated\nbetween the codes at the model nose, as well as any shear\nlayer interaction that may be occurring between the plumes.\nAt ? and ?T 12?, OVERFLOW did not predict the same be-\nhavior as the WTT, predicting a more compressed windward\nbarrel plume for most cases This discrepancy in qualitative\ncomparison did not seem to greatly influence the average\nsurface pressure comparison.\nFor the 4-nozzle configuration, a steadier mode with a short\nshock standoff distance existed for lower CT s. As CT was\nincreased, the flow becomes highly unsteady with the bow\nshock standoff distance aperiodically oscillating between\nsmall and large standoff distances. The unsteady flowfield\nwas predicted well with the CFD codes, but the average sur-\nface pressures were not comparable to WTT data, presumably\ndue to large differences in data acquisition rates between the\nCFD and WTT and the large difference in time-averaging\nwindows. At ? 4? and 8?, a steadier mode was noted\nwhich was not predicted by OVERFLOW, which continued\nto predict a largely chaotic flowfield.\nGiven the comparisons in this validation study confidence\nwas built in the ability of CFD to simulate 1-nozzle con-\nfigurations at all ? angles tested, and high thrust 3-nozzle\nconfigurations at ? ? 8?. The ability to simulate the\nbehavior seen in the high thrust 4-nozzle cases was also\ndemonstrated, but average surface pressure comparisons were\npoor. The ability of the CFD codes to predict the exact\nboundary between steady and unsteady modes for 1-, 3-, and\n4-nozzle configurations was not demonstrated, and in fact\noffered contradictory results in both the LRC UPWT and\nARC UPWT tests for the 4-nozzle ?/? zero configuration.\nThe average surface pressure comparisons were the best for\nthe 1-nozzle configuration and for the steadier runs of the\n3- and 4-nozzle configurations. This correlates to steadier\nflowfields where the large difference in data acquisition rates\nbetween the CFD WTT did not greatly influence the averages\nobtained. Another possible error source may be the grid\nsystems used for each code which were optimized for 1-\nnozzle SRP flow, not for multi-nozzle flows with shear layer\ninteractions.\nThrust dominance and computational costs were also men-\ntioned. Computational costs were high for validation but\ncould be much less for production.\nFuture work for CFD validation would include live rocket\ntests including startup transients, more flight-relevant calcu-\nlations including Mars atmospheric and rocket nozzle gases,\nand an application to flight-scaled spacecraft to better under-\nstand the influence of aerodynamics on stability and control.\nFuture wind tunnel tests could include pressure measurement\ninstrumentation along the model shoulder to help validate\nCFD in that area. More CFD research may be needed to\nproperly define the boundaries between different behavioral\nmodes, as well as an optimization of a grid system for multi-\nnozzle SRP flowfields.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nPieter G.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
