However, most of the QoS routing solutions are not\nevaluated in a realistic framework. In this paper we propose\na networking evaluation of multi-constrained routing to assess\nthe potential bene?t of QoS routing protocol. To do this, we\nconverted a multi-constrained routing algorithm into a protocol,\nand implemented it in the simulator NS2. Our results indicate\nthat if the monitoring tool of a network can not sustain frequent\nlink-state announcements, the bene?ts coming from implementing\na QoS routing are quite low. On the other hand, if the network is\nequipped with an adequate measurement tool, then QoS routing\ncan be worth implementing, and the routing based only the\navailable bandwidth at each link arises as the best option \(no\nneed to consider the end-to-end delay constraint, nor the loss\nrate constraint classes;\nPerformance evaluation.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBack in the 1970s, Internet was thought to support network\ncommunications without any performance guarantees. The\noriginal idea was simply to provide a best-effort delivery\nservice to a single class of traf?c. However, Internet has\nsince undergone numerous changes. The number of users has\nbeen growing worldwide, the number of resource-intensive\napplications, e.g big data transmission, is constantly going\nup, and recent applications, such as Voice over IP, peer-to-\npeer video exchange or real-time multimedia applications, with\nstrict Quality of Service \(QoS emerged.\nThese applications must also coexist with seminal Internet\napplications, such as mail or remote access.\nSeveral solutions have been proposed to cope with these\nprofound changes while preserving the current networking\ninfrastructure. These include techniques like IntServ, DiffServ,\nMPLS and Admission Control. Some of them, e.g., MPLS\npaths, are frequently deployed in backbone networks, but\nthey do not provide a comprehensive QoS solution. Another\napproach, simple and widely used by operators, is to overpro-\nvision the network so that the links capacity goes far beyond\nthe expected workload needs [6]. However, this approach may\nface limitations in the long run. First, it might be too expensive\nin the future to systematically overprovision a network as\nThis work has been partially supported by the project Semantic Networking\nwithin the common laboratory INRIA / Alcatel-Lucent Bell-Labs.\nthe network workload increases. Second, speeding up the\nperformance of all networking communications, when only\na speci?c subset of them needs to be improved, can be seen\nas an inef?cient use of resource for operators.\nProviding QoS to ?ows in both an ef?cient and scalable\nway still remains as a challenging issue for network operators.\nSeveral operators and researchers agree that the core of next-\ngeneration networks should be designed with the idea of\nproviding a native support to applications with tight constraints\non bandwidth, loss rate or end-to-end delay [10]. In fact,\nfuture networks should, on one hand, ensure accurate and\ntunable guarantees to each individual ?ow requesting QoS,\nand on the other hand, from the operators point of view, be\nsimple to deploy, easy to manage and allow a high level of\nnetwork resource utilization. Existing QoS solutions, based\non best-effort routes such as DiffServ and IntServ [15], [16],\ncan hardly meet these objectives. QoS routing can then be\nviewed as an attractive approach to tackle this issue since\nit can carefully compute routes with speci?c requirements.\nSome authors view QoS routing as the missing piece in a\ncomprehensive QoS architecture for the Internet [9], [14],\n[5]. Of course, other new solutions such as Software-De?ned\nNetworking \(SDN of a great help into this goal.\nMany QoS routing algorithms have been proposed in the\nliterature [3], [7 These algorithms are usually derived as\nsolutions to the Multi-Constrained Optimal Path problem\n\(MCOP their framework, authors consider a cost or, more\ngenerally, a vector of costs for each link of the network.\nSuch vectors of costs aim at re?ecting the current state\nof the link through several metrics. Typical metrics include\nthe available bandwidth \(i.e., residual capacity link \(including queueing\ndelay i.e., the probability that an incoming\npacket is dropped due to the buffer over?ow their evaluation only pertain to the algorithm evaluation\nwith regards to its computational complexity and memory\nrequirement [11]. Others use numerical simulations to assess\nthe effectiveness of their algorithm in a more realistic network\ncontext [4], [13]. However, these simulations may fail to\ncapture some signi?cant aspects of computer network. First,\nthe initial values for the link costs and the QoS requirements\nof ?ows are often chosen randomly. Second, when a new ?ow\nattempts to access a link, the new cost of this link is simply\n2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops\n978-0-7695-4987-3/13

Though\nsumming up costs could be a roughly fair approximation when\ncosts pertain to the available bandwidth, such an assumption\nis obviously no longer true for parameters like delay or loss\nrate. Third, models used to represent the network traf?c can\nbe seen as unrealistic. In some cases [4], network traf?c is\nsimply described by the vector of its QoS requests, and not by\nan actual ?ow of packets. Finally, the stale link-state problem,\nwhich impairs QoS effectiveness due to out-of-date collected\nannouncements, is barely considered, except in a couple of\narticles, reviewed in [8 Overall, QoS routing algorithms are\nrarely evaluated as QoS routing protocols, and this shortage\nmakes it dif?cult to fairly assess the potential bene?t of QoS\nrouting solutions. We conclude this state of the art with the\nwork of Shaikh et al. They provided a practical evaluation\nof their routing solution [12]. However as their QoS routing\nwas only designed to handle bandwidth requests, their results\napply to a single-constrained routing scheme.\nThis paper aims at providing ?rst results to bridge the gap\nbetween the theoretical behavior of QoS routing algorithms,\nas provided by their authors, and a more practical focus on\ntheir performance and limitations if they were to be deployed\nin real IP networks. To do this, we converted a well-known\nmulti-constrained routing algorithm, namely PIRA [4] [7], into\na multi-constrained routing protocol, and implemented it in the\nsimulator NS2. This enables us to investigate how much a QoS\nrouting protocol can help in meeting the needs of applications\nwith ?rm transmission requirements. Our contributions are\ntwofold. On the one hand, our results indicate that QoS\nrouting can be effective even if we only consider the ?ow\nrequirements in terms of data rate. On the other hand, if the\nfrequency at which the link-state announcements are generated\nand broadcasted is too low, then QoS routing becomes of\nlittle help, whatever the considered costs are. The remainder\nof this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we\ndescribe our investigation framework. Section III is devoted\nto the performance evaluation results. Section IV concludes\nthis paper.\nII. INVESTIGATION FRAMEWORK\nIn this section, we describe the framework we use to assess\nthe potential bene?ts of using a QoS routing protocol. It\nincludes the selected multi-constrained routing algorithm and\nthe different building blocks we implemented in order to make\nthe algorithm closer to a real routing protocol.\nA. Traf?c classes\nA simple and commonly used approach to classify the\nInternet traf?c is to consider two types or classes of Internet\ntraf?c: elastic traf?c and inelastic traf?c [1].\nElastic traf?c requires no speci?c QoS, and therefore only\nexpects - at least to a certain extent - the routing algorithm to\n?nd a feasible path between sources and destinations. Flows\ninto this class obtain unspeci?ed variable bit rate, delivery time\nand loss rate, which depend on the current traf?c workload.\nIn our framework we assume that network operators simply\nprovide a best-effort service to ?ows from this class.\nBy contrast inelastic traf?c is vulnerable to delay and\npacket loss. It is made up of ?ows that require speci?c levels\nof QoS. Typical examples include audio and video ?ows since\nthose latter have ?rm requirements in terms of end-to-end\ndelays and losses. In our experimental framework, whenever\na new inelastic ?ow is created, the network computes an “ad\nhoc” path based on a multi-constrained routing algorithm.\nB. Multi-constrained routing algorithm\nAs said before, the search for paths satisfying QoS re-\nquirements is performed thanks to PIRA [4 PIRA is a\nlink-state algorithm based on an “All Hops k-shortest Paths”\nalgorithm that basically proceeds in two phases: a ?rst phase\nthat iteratively computes all hops k-shortest paths using a\nsingle cost de?ned as a linear combination of the different\ncosts contained in the QoS requests; and a second phase that\nselects a feasible path from the set of paths computed in the\n?rst phase. The greater k, the more likely PIRA will ?nd a\nsatisfying path \(assuming its existence almost always\nreturns a feasible path \(if any exist  PIRA does not miss a feasible\npath during its search \(provided it gets up-to-date knowledge\non the link-states being a link-state algorithm, the state of each link \(viz.\nits cost node of the\nnetwork. Of course, the cost of each link is dynamic \(it varies\nwith time amount of traf?c traversing\nit. We now describe how each node of the network gets \(more\nor less recent information regarding the states of the networks\nlinks. First, each node continuously monitors the state of its\nadjacent links, and computes the mean observed values for\nthe available bandwidth, the packet delay, and the packet\nloss rate. Second, link-state announcements, which comprise\nthese vectors of costs, are periodically broadcasted across the\nnetwork. Obviously, the time that elapses between two link-\nstate announcements deeply affects the paths computed by\nPIRA. We consider different values for this update period For\nthe ease of readability, we express the time period between two\nconsecutive updates in terms of the number of inelastic ?ows\nthat attempted to enter in the network. We denote this number\nof ?ows by i. Thus the two 


extreme scales are \(i 1, and \(ii inelastic traf?c, we consider all routing schemes\nresulting from the possible combinations of the three described\nmetrics used to assess the actual cost of a link, namely the\nBandwidth, the Delay and the Loss rate For the sake of\n720\nCost / Metric Corresponding constraint Routing schemes\nBandwidth mink?s\(P BD, BL and B\nLoss rate 1? \(?k?s\(P 1? Lk P P  SCHEMES.\nreadability, we denote each scheme by the capitals of the\nmetrics that are actually involved in the search for the path.\nFor instance, the BDL scheme refers to the case where PIRA\ntakes into account the whole link costs measurements. On the\nother hand, the DL scheme relates to the case where only\nthe delays and loss rates reported values matter for the QoS\nrouting. Hence, seven schemes have been studied: BDL, BD,\nBL, DL, B D, L. Finally, we also include the case where PIRA\nsimply disregards the update reports, and therefore route\ninelastic ?ows just as elastic traf?c, i.e., through the shortest\npath in terms of number of hops towards the destination. We\ndenote this scheme by H. Of course, we expect that the more\nknowledge the nodes get, the better the QoS routing will\nperform.\nE. Formal statement of the problem\nLet f be an incoming inelastic ?ow whose source and\ndestination are nodes A and B, respectively. f has a data rate\nof b and has strict constraints both on its packet loss rate and\non its end-to-end delay. We denote by l and d their maximum\nallowable values, respectively. If the performance of f happen\nto go beyond any of these two values the QoS of f is then\ndeclared to be unmet.\nThe QoS routing works as follows. Based on its latest\nreceived link-states announcements \(that re?ect the state of\neach network link j in terms of the available bandwidth Bj ,\nthe delay experienced by packets, Dj , and the rate of loss,\nLj between nodes A and\nB so that P satis?es the QoS requirements of f . We report\nthe set of possible constraints in Table I. Obviously, depending\non the QoS routing scheme, the set of \(operating see Table I actual performance\nof f , once injected in the network, meet its QoS requirements,\nnamely if its loss rate and its end-to-end delay are less than\nl and d, respectively. The outcome of this test step can be\nnegative due to variations in the network workload, and to the\nstaleness of measurement data.\nIII. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nA Simulation-driven approach\nTo assess the potential bene?t of QoS routing, we conduct a\nsimulation-driven study. We equip the network simulator NS2\nwith a multi-constrained routing protocol, derived from PIRA\nalgorithm, as explained in Section II.

This topology, depicted in Figure 1, aimed at\nrepresenting the backbone of a north-american network oper-\nator. We set the links attributes as follows. The links exhibit\nbandwidth capacities of 10 Mbps or 50 Mbps \(represented in\nFigure 1 by plain and bold lines respectively network topology.\nWe use Poisson sources to represent the class of elastic\ntraf?c. Over each \(unidirectional link, a Poisson source, de-\nlivering 1000 bytes packets, generates workload at a constant\nrate. The rates of sources are uniformly distributed between\n50, 60 and 70% of the link capacity \(i.e., bandwidth rates, packets may be exposed to queueing delays in the\nlink buffers and also to buffer over?ows. Hence, we set up the\nelastic traf?c so that, the network is not over-provisioned and\nso that is not straightforward to provide the requested QoS to\ninelastic ?ows \(e.g., the end-to-end delay between two random\nnodes along the shortest path in terms of hops can often exceed\n150 ms due to long queueing delays a b c d e f g h traf?c is modeled by CBR \(constant bitrate simulations, we consider 20 inelastic ?ows whose source\nand destination are randomly chosen among the network\nnodes. These CBR ?ows have various sending rates and QoS\nrequirements \(see Table II packets for the ?ows\ncorresponding to audio and video applications are of 200 and\n940 bytes respectively These values correspond to QoS levels\nas required by typical codecs for real-time voice and video [1].\nWe consider four possible sequences for the introduction of\ninelastic traf?c within the network \(already loaded 


with elastic\ntraf?c performed simulations of the latter scenario for all\nthe possible schemes of QoS routing and for different levels\nof staleness of the link-state information \(i varies between 1\nand 20, since for each sequence at most 20 inelastic ?ows are\ninjected into the network link-state announcements. If this\nupdate period is too long, then there is a risk for inelastic ?ows\nto be processed along inadequate routes, that may severely\nhamper their performance. This is known as a “false positive”.\nOn the other hand, “false negatives” occur when the network\nrefuses to route a ?ow, though, there was a feasible route.\nIn our experiments, false negatives rarely occur. At the end of\neach simulation, we compute the proportions of inelastic ?ows\nthat receive their requested QoS during all the simulation time.\nFigure 2 shows the corresponding results with the mean\nvalues obtained through our 4 independent sequences of\nintroduction of inelastic ?ows. Each sub?gure relates to a\nspeci?c QoS routing scheme. It reports the proportion of\n\(inelastic of the update period, i. We\nhave represented this proportion when considering only audio\n?ows \(smaller data rate larger data rate a QoS routing uses all the information provided by\nthe update reports, namely the bandwidth, delay and loss rate\nlink-state announcements.\nFirst, we observe from Figure 2\(a rate, tends to outperfom video ?ows.\nThis observation, which also applies for all other scenarios, is\nnot surprising since a lower data rate for a ?ow tend to less\naffect the network and its links.\nSecond, as expected, as long as the length of update period,\ni.e. i, increases, the performance of the QoS routing decreases.\nFor instance, in case of BDL, the percentage of ?ows that\nmeet QoS falls from 92% when every new incoming ?ow is\npreceded by a update on the link measurements to a level\naround 63% when no update at all occur. This trend also\napplies for the other schemes. However, this trend is more\n722\npronounced for cases such as BDL, BD, BL, B than for the\nothers, namely DL, D and L. Of course, in case of the scheme\nH, the proportions of accepted ?ows receiving their QoS is\nindependent of i \(see Figure 2\(h pure\nshortest path scheme, only slightly more than half of inelastic\n?ows receive their requested QoS.\nIV DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nWe now discuss our results and their potential implications\nwhen planning the use of a multi-constrained routing. We\nelaborate our conclusions based on the observations of the\nprevious section as well as other experiments that were run\nwith different settings with respect to the network topology,\nthe levels of workload and the buffer size of the communi-\ncation links. Although the quantitative results may vary, the\nqualitative conclusions remain roughly the same.\nFirst, our experiments show that in order to satisfy almost\nall accepted ?ows, say more than 95% of them, QoS routing\nrequires to rely on more than a single metric. Second, as\nexpected, the frequency at which the nodes send their link-state\nannouncements is a critical factor for QoS routing. However,\nour results indicate that QoS schemes dealing with two or more\nmetrics tend to be quite sensitive to the update period value,\nwhile simpler QoS policies dealing with only one metric seem\nto exhibit a similar behavior for a larger range of time period\nbetween link-state announcements. Third, interestingly, the so-\ncalled B QoS routing scheme, which only relies on the link-\nstate announcements dealing with the available bandwidth on\neach link, does not comply with these two latter rules Indeed,\nthis quite simple B routing policy performs just as well as\nthe best of the other policies though its performance also tend\nto decrease fast when the update period increases. Therefore,\ngiven the con?guration of todays IP networks, QoS routing\non the available bandwidth of each link emerges as the best\ntradeoff among all QoS routing schemes and it can provide\nexcellent results provided the update period is small enough.\nThere is no need to consider the end-to-end delay constraint,\nnor the loss rate constraint since their inclusion does not seem\nto improve the ef?ciency of QoS routing. More generally, the\ngood behavior of the B routing policy seems to support the\nidea that bandwidth is the critical resource in an IP network,\nand that the other performance metrics such as delay and loss\nrate will be met as long as the former is.\nTo sum up, if the monitoring tool of a network can not\nsustain frequent link-state announcements \(i.e., the period\nspacing two consecutive measurement reports is too long On the other hand, if the network is equipped with an\nadequate measurement tool, then QoS routing can be worth\nimplementing, and the routing based only on the available\nbandwidth at each link arises as the best option \(no need\nto consider the end-to-end delay constraint, nor the loss rate\nconstraint  Braun, T., Diaz, M., Enr?´quez-Gabeiras, J., Staub, T.: End-to-End Quality\nof Service over Heterogeneous Networks.

Classi?cation accuracies of deep SPN, SAC [12 11], and MAC [2]. The ?rst three rows are on the unoccluded test set, and the last three are on\nthe occluded test set.\nwith the separate attribute classi?ers \(SAC  MAC 2] on both the\nunoccluded and occluded testing images. The SAC trains a\nbinary SVM classi?er for each attribute. The original MAC\nis to predict human attribute based on poselets. We apply\nit to faces by replacing the poselets with our discriminative\nregions in Sec.2 and then train different level of classi?ers\nas in [2 Note that MAC can model pairwise attribute\ncorrelations.\nThe results are reported in Table 1. On the unoccluded\ntest, the averaged classi?cation accuracies of SAC, MAC,\nand deep SPN are 82.1%, 84.4%, and 87.9 respectively,\nwhile the corresponding accuracies on the occluded test set\nare 68.0%, 72.1%, and 79.8%. The deep SPN generally\nperforms better especially with the presence of occlusions,\nbecause it effectively models the high-order correlations\nbetween attributes and regional classi?ers. On the occluded\ntest set, the deep SPN signi?cantly outperforms SAC and\nMAC on nearly all the attributes, because SAC assumes\nindependence between attributes, while MAC can only\nmodel pairwise correlation. We also examine our SPTs\nalone. The averaged accuracies are 81.9% and 70.2%\nof the unoccluded and occluded tests, respectively, which\nindicate their performances can be signi?cantly improved\nwhen organizing them into the deep SPN. Moreover, it takes\n2 hours to train our deep SPN on two 3.3 GHz CPUs and\n16G RAMs, and 5.3 seconds to classify 73 attributes of an\nimage which is comparable to 5 seconds of MAC in the\nsame experimental environment.\nIII. Experiments on synthetic datasets. We evaluate\nthe robustness of deep SPN under different levels of\nocclusions on a synthetic dataset We use the same training\nand unoccluded test sets as in parts I and II. However,\nfor each sample in the test set, a series of corrupted\nimages are generated with the following strategy. We\n?rst generate random noise that covers the whole image,\nand then gradually reduce the coverage of noise towards\none of the four directions: “Top to Bottom”, “Bottom to\nTop”, “Left to Right”, and “Right to Left”. An example\nof generating occluded images along the “Right to Left”\ndirection is shown in Fig.8.\nFig.8 plots the classi?cation accuracies of the deep SPN\nwhen the percentage of visible image region is increased\nfrom 10% to 80%. At 50 visibility, all the accuracies are\nover 75% \(random guess is 50 few attributes need to be observed in\norder to infer the others. As plotted at the left of Fig.9, we\naverage the accuracies of the four directions and compare\nwith SAC and MAC. Our method clearly shows superior\nperformance, showing that our method is more robust when\nlarge occlusions are present.\n2870\nFigure 8 Classi?cation accuracies of deep SPN under different levels of\nocclusions.\nFigure 9. We compare our deep SPN with SAC [12] and MAC [2] under\ndifferent levels of occlusions.\n6. Conclusion\nThis paper has proposed a facial attribute estimation\nframework, where attribute estimation is achieved by\ncombining discriminative decision trees with a SPN. For\nrobust attribute estimation, we devise a deep architecture to\ncapture attribute correlations for the SPN, where occlusion\nhandling is casted as marginalizing the variables of the\nundetected regions. Experimental results on both occluded\nand unoccluded images show great improvement and indi-\ncate that our method is very robust under different levels of\nocclusions.

between the MSL flight computer and the Electra-\nLite UHF Transceiver that resulted in constraints on nallowable command data product size and development of a \ncomplex buffer management system to avoid truncating \ndownlink frames.  While operational workarounds were \nultimately identified, these idiosyncrasies resulted in more \ncomplex ground processes and delayed other critical relay \ntests.  Future missions should ensure early and thorough \ndocumentation and validation of the end-to-end relay data \npath. \nVerification Validation \(V&V including during the cruise phase of the mission.  \nWhile these were addressed prior to arrival at Mars, and nactual surface operations have proceeded smoothly, it would \nhave been desirable to identify these issues earlier.  The \nchallenge here, which is common to the previous \nexperiences with MER and PHX, is that the testing timeline \nis dictated by the lander mission’s V&V test program and \ntestbed accessibility.  The Mars Exploration Program may \nneed to establish more formal guidelines for the scope and \nschedule of testing related to verification and validation of \nrelay services, and ensure that all missions develop their test nschedules and corresponding resource profiles to meet those \nguidelines. \nEnd-to-End Relay Testbeds:  The fidelity of the end-to-end \ntestbeds for relay system testing can play a significant role \nin the overall success of the V&V test campaign.  For the \nMSL-MRO link, both the orbiter and lander projects had \nhigh fidelity spacecraft testbeds resident at JPL, with \nEngineering Models of the Electra and Electra-Lite ntransceivers, and with flight-like representations of the \nspacecraft Command & Data Handling \(C&DH subsystem.  \nWhile these testbeds were located at separate sites within \nthe JPL campus, fiber optic links supported signal flow \nbetween them, as well as integration of a high-fidelity link \nchannel simulator capable of emulating realistic time \nvariation of link amplitude, frequency, and delay, enabling \nthorough end-to-end data flow testing over a range of flight-\nlike signal conditions.  For ODY and MEX, however, each \norbiter project had only a portable test set available at JPL to \nsupport cross-project testing with MSL, each with a flight-\nlike UHF transceiver but with lower fidelity representations \nof the orbiter C&DH.  This limited the scope of ground \ntesting possible on the MSL-ODY and MSL-MEX links.  \nThis, combined with some non-flight-like aspects of the \nODY test set that were discovered late in the V&V test \ncampaign, resulted in the deferral of full validation and use \nof the MSL-ODY forward link capability until well after \nlanding.  The conclusions here are that high-fidelity testbeds \nincrease the robustness of end-to-end relay testing; when \nprogrammatic considerations limit the test hardware fidelity, \nit is essential to clearly document and assess any non-flight-\nlike aspects of the testbed infrastructure. \nElectromagnetic Interference:  Uncertainty in the MRO nEMI environment resulted in significant concern prior to \nMSL arrival as to whether Curiosity would be able to \nachieve the desired 250 Mb/sol data return via the MRO \nrelay path.  This resulted in a large amount of MRO flight \nand ground testing to attempt to better quantify the EMI \nimpacts as a function of Electra return link frequency.  It \nalso drove the need for a lengthy commissioning phase \nduring the first few months of MSL surface operations, to \ncarefully monitor performance as each MRO science \ninstrument was powered on Electra’s frequency-agility \nturned out to be an important tool in mitigating the EMI \nimpacts.  In hindsight earlier and more thorough flight \ntesting could have provided more confidence in the \npredicted MRO relay performance; however, such testing \nwould have required interruption of ongoing MRO science \nobservations Ultimately, future missions will want to \naddress EMI issues earlier in the spacecraft/instrument \ndevelopment cycle to identify and mitigate any spurious \nemissions prior to launch. \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nNASA’s ODY and MRO orbiters and ESA’s MEX orbiter \nembody an international network of Mars relay orbiters, \nproviding essential telecommunication services to the Mars \nScience Laboratory mission.  All three orbiters provided ncomplementary coverage of MSL’s EDL, acquiring tracking \nand telemetry data from MSL’s UHF transmission that ncould have provided essential information for fault \nreconstruction had a mission-ending anomaly occurred nduring EDL.  Since landing, ODY and MRO are providing \nthe highest levels of data return yet achieved for a Mars \nlander, with over 45 Gb of Curiosity data returned over the \nfirst 90 sols of the surface mission.  Key to this level of \nperformance are a number of new capabilities in the Electra \nand Electra-Lite UHF Transceivers on MRO and MSL, \nrespectively, including higher data rates, frequency-agile \noperations, and adaptive data rates, as well as the dedication \nof the operations teams on each mission and the MaROS nmultimission relay operations tools and processes \nsupporting them. \n \n   978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE \n 11 \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe research described in this paper was carried out at the \nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of \nTechnology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration. \nREFERENCES  \n [1] Charles D.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
