INTRODUCTION\nDistributed computing has received a lot of attention\nlately to perform high data-intensive tasks in the era of\nBig Data. Extensive powerful distributed hardware and\nservice infrastructures capable of processing millions of\nthese tasks are available around the world Programming\nmodels have being created to make efficient use of such\ncloud environments. In this context MapReduce \(MR  as a major alternative for the\nefficient distributed data-intensive tasks.\nEntity Matching \(EM also known as entity resolution,\ndeduplication, or record linkage demands studies on how it can\nbenefit from cloud computing. EM is applied to determine\nall entities referring to the same real world object given a\nset of data sources [2]. The task has critical importance for\ndata cleaning and integration, e.g., to find duplicate product\ndescriptions in databases.\nThe main problem that makes EM so heavy to perform\nis related to the need of applying matching techniques on\nthe Cartesian product of all input entities \(naive n2 of such approach is very ineffective. To minimize\nthe workload caused by the Cartesian product execution and\nto maintain the match quality, techniques like blocking [3]\nbecome necessary. Such techniques work by partitioning the\ninput data into blocks of similar entities and restricting EM\nto entities of the same block For instance, it is sufficient to\ncompare entities of the same manufacturer when matching\nproduct offers.\nNevertheless, even using blocking techniques, EM re-\nmains hard to process for large datasets [4 Therefore, EM\nis an ideal problem to be treated with a distributed solution.\nThe execution of blocking-based EM can be done in parallel\nwith the MR model by using several map and reduce tasks.\nMore specifically, the map tasks can read the input entities\nin parallel and redistribute them among the reduce tasks\naccording to the blocking key. Entities sharing the same\nblocking key are assigned to a common reduce task and\nseveral blocks can be matched in parallel.\nHowever, this simple MR implementation, known as Ba-\nsic, has vulnerabilities Severe load imbalances can occur\ndue to skewed blocks sizes since the match work of entire\nblocks is assigned to few reduce tasks. In other words, large\nblocks can occupy a node for a long time and thus leave\nthe other nodes idle. This is not interesting since there is\nan urgency to complete the EM process as quickly as pos-\nsible. Furthermore, idle but instantiated nodes may produce\nunnecessary costs because public cloud environments \(e.g.,\nAmazon EC2  been addressed with\nBlockSplit [4], a general load balancing MR-based approach\nthat takes the size of blocks into account. It splits larger\nblocks, according to the load balancing constraints, into\nsmaller chunks based on the input partitions to enable their\nparallel matching. The approach also uses a heuristic to\nassign the entire blocks and the smaller chunks to the\nreduce tasks. More details about this work will be shown\nin the Related Work section. However, this solution has\nload imbalances and excessive entity replication issues that\nundermine its running time. To overcome these problems,\nwe make the following contributions:\n• We propose BlockSlicer, an MR-based approach that\nprovides a load balancing improvement by applying\nan efficient block slice strategy. The approach takes\nthe size of blocks into account and generates match\n978-1-4799-3755-4/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 000618\ntasks of entire blocks only if this does not violate\nthe load balancing constraints. Larger blocks are sliced\ninto several match tasks to enable a fewer number of\ncomparisons respecting the Cartesian product. A greedy\noptimization is used to assign match tasks of entire\nblocks and sliced ones to the proper reduce tasks aiming\nto optimize the load balancing parallel matching.\n• We evaluate BlockSlicer against BlockSplit and show\nthat our approach provides a better load 


balancing\nstrategy by reducing the amount of data generated from\nthe map phase and diminishing the overall execution\ntime. The evaluation is performed on a real cloud\nenvironment and uses real-world data.\nII. RELATED WORK\nEntity Matching is a very studied research topic. Many\napproaches have been proposed and evaluated as described\nin the recent survey [2]. However there are only a few\napproaches that consider parallel entity matching. The first\nsteps in order to evaluate the parallel Cartesian product of\ntwo sources is described in 5]. [6] proposes a generic model\nfor parallel entity matching based on general partitioning\nstrategies that take memory and load balancing requirements\ninto account.\nIn our context, parallel hash join processing [7], a skew\nhandling mechanism available in parallel database systems,\nshare many similarities with our problem However, the real\nperformance gain when dealing with MapReduce comes\nfrom the injection of skew handling into a user-defined\nfunction \(map, reduce, part, and group minimize its effects\non performance by efficiently distributing entity replication\namong all nodes.\nA few MR-based approaches address the load balancing\nand skew handling problem. [8] applied a static load bal-\nancing mechanism, but it is not suitable due to arbitrary\njoin assumptions. Similarly to our work, the authors employ\na previous analysis phase to determine the datasets’ charac-\nteristics \(using sampling thereafter avoid the evaluation\nof the Cartesian product. This approach focus on data skew\nhandle in the map process output, which leads to an overhead\nin the map phase and large amount of map output. Our\napproach is less coarse-grained.\nMapReduce has already been employed for EM \(e.g.,\n[9 main focus and only\none mechanism of near duplicate detection by the PPjoin\nparadigm adapted to the MapReduce framework can be\nfound. [10] studies load balancing for Sorted Neighborhood\n\(SN different blocking approach\n\(fixed window size  another approach for parallel pro-\ncessing entity matching on a cloud infrastructure. This study\nexplains how a single token-based string similarity function\nperforms with MR. However, this approach suffers from\nload imbalances because some reduce tasks process more\ncomparisons than the others.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, [4] addresses our prob-\nlem. The authors present two approaches, BlockSplit and\nPairRange, and compare them with Basic \(approach without\nload balancing mechanisms that\nprocesses small blocks within single match tasks similar to\nBasic. The larger blocks are split according to the m input\npartitions into m sub-blocks obeying an appropriate scheme\nof entity replication \(based on m input partitions a virtual enumeration of all\nentities and the relevant comparisons \(pairs provided by the so-called BDM, Block\nDistribution Matrix \(Section IV.A tasks according to the relevant comparisons\nbelonging to ranges previously established based on the\naverage workload. These algorithms are capable to deal\nwith skewed data \(blocking key provide\nbalanced workload among all reduce tasks, but they still\nsuffer from load imbalances \(only BlockSplit and generate\nunnecessary entity replication \(mainly PairRange uniform distribution than\nBlockSplit, it generates too much entity replication \(for\nload balancing purposes which leads to an extra overhead\n\(discussed in Section V  perform equals or worse than BlockSplit.\nIn addition, such overhead can lead to lack of memory prob-\nlems also discussed in Section V reason,\nwe have only implemented BlockSplit and compare it with\nour work in an experimental evaluation.\nIII MAPREDUCE AND ENTITY MATCHING\nMapReduce is a programming model designed for parallel\ndata-intensive computing in shared-nothing clusters with a\nlarge number of nodes [1]. The key idea relies on data\npartitioning and storage in a distributed file system \(DFS key, value is expressed with two user defined functions:\nmap : keyin, valuein ?? list\(keytmp, valuetmp list\(valuetmp keyout, valueout partitions of the input data. For each input key-value\npair, the map function is called and outputs a temporary\nkey-value pair that will be used as input for the reduce\nfunction. Unlike the map function, the reduce function is\ncalled every time a temporary key occurs as map output.\nHowever, within one reduce function only the corresponding\nvalues list\(valuetmp set of nodes that run a fixed\nnumber of map and reduce jobs. For each MR job execution,\n978-1-4799-3755-4/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 000619\nFigure 1. Overview of the MR-based matching process with load balancing\n\(adapted from [4 m r framework-specific scheduling mechanism ensures\nthat after a task has finished, another task is automatically\nassigned to the released process.\nAlthough there are several frameworks that implement the\nMapReduce programing model, in the scientific community,\nHadoop [12] is the most popular implementation of 


this\nparadigm. We therefore implemented and evaluated our\napproach with Hadoop.\nAs mentioned in Section I parallel EM implementation\nusing blocking approaches with MR can be done without\nmajor difficulties. In a simple way, denoted by Basic [4],\nthe map process defines the blocking key for each input\nentity and outputs a key-value pair \(blockingKey, entity the blocking key to assign the key-value pairs to the\nproper reduce task. The reduce process will be responsible\nfor performing the entity matching computation for each\nblock. An evaluation of the Basic approach showed a poor\nperformance due to the data skewness caused by varying size\nblocks [4]. This skewness problem can lead to situations\nin which the execution time may be dominated by a few\nreduce tasks and serious memory problems when processing\ntoo large blocks. Therefore, concerns about load balancing\nbecomes necessary.\nIV GENERAL MR-BASED ENTITY MATCHING\nWORKFLOW FOR LOAD BALANCING\nTo perform our load balancing optimization for EM\nprocessing, we need two MR jobs as illustrated in Figure\n1.\nA. First Job: Block Distribution Matrix\nThe first job, presented in [4], generates the so-called\nBlock Distribution Matrix \(BDM preprocessing\nstep to determine some datasets’ characteristics. The BDM\nconsists in a b x m matrix that specifies the number of\nFigure 2. Dataflow example for computing block distribution matrix\n\(adapted from 4 an example dataset.\nThe 14 entities \(A-O a blocking key \(w-z equals z and M appears in the\nsecond partition \(partition index=1 task that outputs [z, 1, 3] because there are\n3 entities in the second partition for blocking key z The\ncombined reduce outputs correspond to the BDM. To assign\nblocking keys to rows of the BDM, we use the order of the\nblocks from the reduce output, i.e., we assign the first block\n\(key w and so on.\nThe block sizes in the example vary from 2 \(y z entities per\nblock with each other thus ranges from 1 \(y z entails 50% \(10\nof 20 5\nof 14 illustrated in Figure 1, the map processes produce an\nadditional output ??i per input partition that contains the\noriginal entities annotated with their blocking keys. This\noutput is shown in Figure 4 as input of the second MR\njob.\nB. Second Job: Improving Block-based Load Balancing\nThe second job performs our load balancing optimization\napproach for EM denoted by BlockSlicer. This optimizer is\nresponsible for creating match tasks per block and distribut-\ning these match tasks among the reduce tasks effectively. To\nbe more specific, our approach uses the following key ideas:\n• Similar to the BlockSplit approach, smaller blocks are\nprocessed within a single match task. Larger blocks are\nsliced according to a cutting strategy aiming at perform-\ning the Cartesian product of such blocks in parallel and\n978-1-4799-3755-4/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 000620\nensuring that all comparisons of the original block will\nbe computed.\n• BlockSlicer determines the number of comparisons per\nmatching task and assigns match tasks to the reduce\ntasks using a greedy algorithm for optimization pur-\nposes.\nEach map function generates a well-defined composite\nkey that \(together with the associated partition information about the target reduce task\(s processed\nby multiple reduce tasks, the map function generates multi-\nple keys per entity and the information about the entity itself\nis added to its key. The reduce phase performs the EM by\ncomputing match similarities between entities of the same\nblock. Since the reduce phase consumes the vast majority\nof the overall runtime more than 90%, according to our\nexperiments redistribution for reduce tasks.\nBlockSlicer’s mappers output key-value pairs with key=\n\(reduceIndex \f blockIndex entity before, its key is composed by reduceIndex \f\nblock-Index \f slice. The reduce task index has a value\nbetween 0 and r ? 1 and is used by the MR function part\nto perform assignments to the reduce tasks. Since the block\nindex is part of the key and the MR function group takes\nthe entire key into account, it is ensured that each reduce\nfunction only receives entities of the same block. The slice\nvalue indicates what kind of match task has to be performed\nby the reduce function, i.e., whether a complete block or\nsliced-blocks need to be processed.\nAt the beginning, each of the m map tasks reads the BDM\nand computes the number of comparisons per block as well\nas the number of comparisons T over all b blocks ?k:\nT = 12 ·\n?b?1\nk=0 | ?k | · \(| ?k | ?1 each block ?k, the map tasks also check if the number\nof comparisons is above the average reduce task workload,\ni.e., if\n1\n2 · | ?k | · \(| ?k | ?1 be processed within a single match task \(as mentioned\nbefore, the map output key only contains information about\nthe reduce index and the block index k 


sliced-block is generated according to a special\ncutting strategy based on the workload average. The basic\nidea is defined as follows. Given a complete block k whose\nCartesian product violates the load balancing constraint, the\nobjective is to maximize the number of entities allowed\n| ??k | to permute all the comparisons with the other entities\nbelonging to k subject to average workload restrictions \(find\nFigure 3. Slice schema illustration.\nthe exact slicing perform the Cartesian\nproduct among themselves. The non allowed entities are\nreplicated and thus a new complete block is formed with\nthese replications. Thereafter, this complete block is sub-\njected to a new average workload verification and if its T\nstill violates the load balancing constraint then the complete\nblock will be submitted to another slice process \(recursive\nprocedure entities allowed is calculated\nas:\n\(| ?k | ? 1 k | ? | ??k following simplification1:\n1\n2 · \(\(2· | ?k | · | ??k desired solution. Since | ??k | has two\nsolutions \(quadratic equation 0 < b| ??k |c < | ?k |.\nFor illustration purposes, we use an example with a com-\nplete block having 5 entities, which leads to 10 comparisons,\nand an average workload equals to 7 as shown in Figure\n3. Note, in the example, that the number of comparisons\ngenerated by block z is above the average workload \(10 > 7 thus z is sliced and transformed into two sub-blocks, one\nsliced-block \(z z having\n\(| ?z | - | ??z block. However, the\n\(| ?z | - | ??z means that these entities are\nnot allowed to perform comparisons with the others marked\nentities, but only with the non-marked ones. Figure 3 shows\nthat | ??z | value is 2, in this case, only the first 2 entities F\nand G ones are\nreplicated generating a new complete block. As shown in\nthe example, this new complete block is subjected to a new\n1See Appendix for a proof\n978-1-4799-3755-4/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 000621\nFigure 4.

At the same time, for each slice-block created\na single match task is generated with the information about\nthe blocking key index, the sliced-block index in l and the\nnumber of pairs \(comparisons follows:\nTsliced =\n?|??k|\nn=1 \(| ?k | ? n index of z is equal to 3 then the blocking map will be\n[3, [2,3]] and the match tasks will be [3, 0, 7] and 3, 1, 3].\nSince all match tasks are defined both for complete block\nand sliced-blocks, we apply a greedy algorithm to optimally\ndetermine the reduce task for each match task. Firstly, all\nmatch tasks are sorted in descending order of their number\nof pairs \(comparisons tasks in this order so that the current\nmatch task is assigned to the reduce task with the lowest\nnumber of already assigned pairs. In the following, we\ndenote the reduce task index for match task k.x as R\(k.x the describe initialization phase, the map function\nmap is called for each input entity e. If e belongs to a block\n?k that is not set as sliced, map outputs one key-value pair\nwith composite key=R\(k consults the\nBDM to identify how many entities sharing the blocking key\nk belongs to the previous partitions aiming to find, in the\nsliced-block list lk, the index where e is an allowed entity.\nThen map iterates through lk emitting marked \(not allowed k.s the entity annotated by\n”*”, for each index of lk up to its current position and finally\nemits one allowed entity with the key R\(k.s blocking key z into s=2 sliced-blocks. The BDM \(see\nFigure 2 respectively. The resulting sliced-blocks\n?3.0 and ?3.1 lead to two match tasks 3.0 and 3.1 that\naccount for 7 and 3 comparisons, respectively. The resulting\nordering of match tasks by size \(3.0, 0, 2, 3.1 and 1 three\nreduce tasks leads to the distribution shown in Figure 4. The\nreplication of the three entities for the sliced block leads to\n17 key-value pairs for the 14 input entities. Each reduce task\nhas to process between six and seven comparisons indicating\nan optimal load balancing for the example.\nV. EVALUATION\nIn the following, we evaluate2 BlockSlicer against Block-\nSplit approach, which was implemented according to the\npseudo-code available in [4], regarding one performance-\ncritical factor: the number of available nodes n their behavior when\ndealing with the resources consumption caused by the use\nof many map and reduce tasks and 


how they can scale with\nthe number of available nodes.\nWe ran our experiments on a 10-node HP Pavilion P7-\n1130 cluster. Each node had one Intel I5 processor with\nfour cores, 4 GB of RAM, and one 1TB of hard disk Thus\nthe cluster consists of 40 cores and 10 disks. On each node,\nit was installed the Windows 7, 64-bit, JAVA 1.6, cygwin\nand Hadoop 0.20.2. Each node runs at most two map and\nreduce tasks in parallel.\nWe utilized two real-world datasets \(see Figure 5 about 214,000 question records. The second dataset,\nDS2, is by an order of magnitude larger and contains\nabout 1.46 million publication records. For both datasets,\nthe first three letters of the questions or publication title,\nrespectively, form the default blocking key \(only in the\ndegree of data skew experiment, we change the blocking\nscheme to investigate skew effects comparisons computing the Jaro-Winkler distance of\n2The datasets and codes are available in\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/demetriomestre/activities\n978-1-4799-3755-4/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 000622\nFigure 6. Execution times and speedup for both approaches using DS1.\nFigure 7. Number of generated key-value pairs by map for DS1 varying\nthe number of nodes n \(m=2·n, r=4·n those pairs with a similarity\n? 0.7 were regarded as matches.\nA. Scalability: Number of nodes\nAs mentioned in the introduction, scalability is important\nfor many reasons and one of them is the financial. The num-\nber of nodes should be carefully estimated since distributed\ninfrastructure suppliers usually charge per hired machines\neven if they are underutilized. To analyze the scalability of\nthe two approaches, we vary the number of nodes from 1 up\nto 10. Following the Hadoop’s documentation, for n nodes,\nthe number of map tasks is set to m = 2 ·n and the number\nof reduce tasks is set to r = 4·n, i.e., adding new nodes leads\nto additional map and reduce tasks. The resulting execution\ntimes values are shown in Figure 6 \(DS1 DS2 respectively number of generated key-value pairs\nfrom the map phase are illustrated in Figures 7 and 9.\nWe can note that both BlockSlicer and BlockSplit scale\nalmost linearly for the smaller and larger datasets DS1 and\nDS2 respectively showing their ability to evenly distribute\nthe workload across reduce tasks and nodes However, due to\nthe difficulties of the high dependency of the input partitions,\nBlockSplit’s execution time for DS1 is compromised by the\ndeficiency of properly split larger blocks with few input par-\ntitions as we can see in Figure 6 when we vary n from 5 to\nFigure 8. Execution times and speedup for both approaches using DS2.\nFigure 9. Number of generated key-value pairs by map for DS2 varying\nthe number of nodes n \(m=2·n r=4·n BlockSlicer on\nexperiments with 10 nodes \(m=20 and r=40 Furthermore, Figure 6 shows,\nby the map output generation, an overgrowth of output\nentities during the BlockSplit’s map phase. This overgrowth\nleads to an associated overhead caused by unnecessary data\ntransfer network resources reduce\nphase input processing\nreduce tasks, and thereby causes the deterioration of the\nexecution time. Besides, depending on the entities length or\ndataset size, such situation can cause serious lack of memory\nproblems. Note that, for 10 nodes, the amount of output\ngenerated by BlockSplit approach is almost 2 times higher\nthan the amount generated by the BlockSlicer one.\nHowever, the execution of the BlockSplit approach with\nDS2, as depicted in Figure 8, shows that the runtime\ndeterioration, caused by the fact that most entities of large\nblocks belong to the same partition, is diminished due to a\nfavored data distribution among the input partitions. Thus,\nthe execution time distance between the two approaches\ndecreases substantially, although this weakness remains in-\nterfering. Nevertheless, the associated overhead, mentioned\nearlier, grows significantly when performing BlockSplit with\nDS2 which leads BlockSlicer to perform around 16.4% \(one\n978-1-4799-3755-4/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 000623\nmore node working 8. Figure 9\nshows that, for 10 nodes, the amount of output generated by\nthe BlockSplit approach is almost 3 times higher than the\namount generated by the BlockSlicer approach. This limits\nBlockSplit to be used with huge datasets sustainably.\nVI. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\nWe proposed an improved load balancing approach,\nBlockSlicer, for distributed blocking-based entity matching\nusing a well-known MapReduce framework The solution is\nby design efficient to provide load balancing to an entity\nmatching process of huge datasets without depending on\nthe data distribution or order of the input partitions with\na significant improved reduction of the information emitted\nfrom map to reduce phases \(map output skewed data distributions and workload\namong all reduce tasks by slicing large blocks and applying\na greedy optimization to assign match tasks to the reduce\ntasks. Our evaluation on a real cloud environment using\nreal-world data demonstrated that BlockSlicer scale with\nthe number of available nodes without relying on any\nextra architecture configuration. We compared our approach\nagainst an existing one \(BlockSplit

comparison\nbetween 2-way and n-way execution for Merge Join, MAPSIN\nand PigSPARQL as these systems support n-way joins. In all\ncases, n-way joins clearly outperform a sequential execution of\n2-way joins, while the bene?t for our merge join approach is\nless than for the others. Reducing the amount of MapReduce\ncycles comes at the cost of more data that has to be processed\nat once. As we cannot guarantee that all n matching subsets\nreside on the same machine, more data has to be accessed\nremotely. This is underpinned by Figure 8.b that shows the\namount of data accessed locally and retrieved remotely within\na map-side merge join. However the difference is much less\nthan expected. Processing query 4 with one 5-way merge join\ncompared with several 2-way merge joins increases the amount\nof data retrieved remotely by only 32% while decreasing the\namount of data accessed locally by 34%. This can be explained\ndue to the fact that data is stored with an replication factor\nof three which increases the chances that matching subsets\nreside on the same machine. Except for n-way joins, the\namount of data accessed locally within a merge join is always\nhigher than the amount of data retrieved remotely, which is\nan expected behavior since we choose the larger dataset to be\nprocessed locally Nevertheless, since data locality is a crucial\npoint for distributed systems, improving these values, e.g by\na re?nement of the data placement strategy wrt. matching\nsubsets, is a worthwhile point for future optimizations.\nThe average performance bene?t of our Merge Join com-\npared to the other systems is between 15 and 48%. In order\nto compare the performance of the different systems we com-\nputed for each query the relative difference of execution time to\nthe respective best case.

It works best for single join queries but performs\nalso good for sequences of joins. However, unselective subject-\nobject or object-subject joins turned out to be a weak point,\nespecially if one join input side is fairly unbalanced. But\neven for those queries, the differences to the fastest query\nexecution times are still acceptable while showing an excel-\nlent scaling behavior at all time. Moreover, our store layout\nenables retrieving one pattern queries even faster than the\nindex-based query execution of MAPSIN. Taken into account\nthat improving data locality by adopting more suitable data\nplacement strategies for Hadoop and preventing unbalanced\npartitions by more sophisticated partitioning strategies will\nfurther improve query execution times, we can conclude that\nmap-side merge joins are well suited for processing SPARQL\nBGPs with MapReduce.\nVII. RELATED WORK\nIn terms of mere query performance, RDF-3X [19] has\nestablished itself as the state-of-the-art “benchmark engine\nfor single place machines. However, its performance has been\nshown to degrade for queries with unbound objects and low\nselectivity factors [5]. Furthermore, with the ever increasing\namount of available RDF data single machine solutions for\nquery processing become more and more challenging [4].\nThus, a number of systems that focus on distributed execution\nof SPARQL queries have been proposed in recent years\n\(e.g. [20], [21 22 synergy effects by reusing already deployed frame-\nworks. Our research is driven by the idea to reuse 


existing\ninfrastructures for “Big Data” scenarios. Consequently, we\nhave ensured that no changes to the underlying Hadoop\nframework are required to run our SPARQL BGP engine. This\nway, existing Hadoop clusters or cloud services \(e.g. Amazon\nEC2 driver for\nthe performance of SPARQL BGP evaluation, and thus we\nhave focused on join processing in MapReduce in this paper.\nThis topic has already been studied considering various aspects\nand application ?elds [23 24], [13], [25], [26]. In [25] the\nauthors discussed how to process arbitrary joins \(? joins using\nMapReduce, whereas [23] focuses on optimizing n-way joins.\n? joins are not required for the evaluation of SPARQL BGPs,\nand they are not supported by our solution. The execution\nof n-way joins is a generalization of our 2-way join, where\ninstead of two all n pre-sorted input partitions are processed\nin a single map phase Map-Reduce-Merge [26] describes a\nmodi?ed MapReduce work?ow by adding a merge phase after\nthe reduce phase whereas Map-Join-Reduce [24] proposes\na join phase in between the map and reduce phase. Both\ntechniques attempt to improve the support for joins in MapRe-\nduce but require profound modi?cations to the MapReduce\nframework. In [27] the authors present non-invasive index and\njoin techniques for SQL processing in MapReduce that also\nreduce the amount of shuf?ed data at the cost of an additional\nco-partitioning and indexing phase at load time. However, the\nschema and workload is assumed to be known in advance\n637\nwhich is typically feasible for relational data but does not hold\nfor RDF in general. HadoopDB [28] is a hybrid of MapReduce\nand DBMS where MapReduce is the communication layer\nabove multiple single node DBMS. The authors in 4] adopt\nthis hybrid approach for the Semantic Web using RDF-3X.\nInitially, they partition the graph on a single machine in a\nloading phase. We also initially store the dataset wrt. different\nsort orders but we employ the MapReduce framework to par-\ntition the dataset at loading time. Common to both approaches\nis that data has to be reloaded in case of updates, while we do\nnot require the installation of additonal engines at each cluster\nnode. HadoopRDF [5] is a MapReduce based RDF system\nthat stores data directly in HDFS and does also not require\nany changes to the Hadoop framework. It is able to rebalance\nautomatically when cluster size changes but join processing\nis also done in the reduce phase. As already mentioned, our\njoin processing is done in the map phase and additionally\nwe reduce the amount of data sent over the network by pro-\nactively ltering dangling tuples using bloom ?lters.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn the area of “Big Data” applications MapReduce has\nbecome a state-of-the-art technology for large-scale data pro-\ncessing. On the other side, the advent of the Semantic Web pro-\nmotes the growing adoption of RDF and SPARQL as its core\ntechnologies, raising attention for distributed SPARQL query\nprocessing in current research. As basic graph patterns, which\nare at the core of SPARQL, translate to the computation of\njoins on the operator level, ef?cient distributed join techniques\nfor RDF are of particular interest. The ?xed ternary structure\nof RDF makes it a well suited candidate for sort-merge joins\nas presorting the data is affordable. In this paper we presented\nan adaptation of sort-merge joins for SPARQL basic graph\npatterns with MapReduce which supports both 2-way and n-\nway joins The actual join computation is completely done\nin the map phase, complemented by bloom ?lters to discard\ndangling intermediate results, while the reduce phase is used\nto post-process the join output for subsequent join iterations.\nOur experiments with the LUBM bechmark demonstrated an\naverage performance bene?t between 15% and 48% of our\napproach compared to other MapReduce based systems while\nscaling smoothly with the dataset size. For future work, we\nwill consider re?nements of the data placement strategy to\nfurther optimize data locality as well as techniques to handle\ndata skew in parallel joins.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

Schiff \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Towards Model-Based Control in Neural Engineering \n \nAbstract: Since the 1950s, we have developed mature theories of modern control the-\nory and computational neuroscience with little interaction between these disciplines. \nWith the advent of computationally efficient nonlinear Kalman filtering techniques n\(developed in robotics and weather prediction increasingly accurate reconstruction of dynamics in a variety \nnormal and disease states in the brain, the prospects for synergistic interaction between these fields are \nnow strong. I will show recent examples of the use of nonlinear control theory for the assimilation and con-\ntrol of single neuron and network dynamics, a control framework for Parkinson’s disease, and the potential \nfor unification in control of spreading depression and seizures. Lastly, I will discuss why the subtle and \ndeep intersection of symmetry, in brains and models, is important to take into account in this transdisci-\nplinary fusion of computational models of the computational brain with real time control.  \n Biographical Sketch: Steven J.

That has necessitated the challenge of con-\ntrolling the limb with such superior dexterity.  I will introduce methods for dexterous nprosthesis control, from myoelectric to cortical \(EEG, Electrocorticogram, neural \nspike, local field potential incorporating multimodal sensors, such as camera and video tracking, may lead to more functional \nand practical prosthesis control.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
