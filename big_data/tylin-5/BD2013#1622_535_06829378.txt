Impacts of Reduction of CT Radiation Dose on PET \nin PET/CT Imaging \n \nTing Xia, Wenli Wang, Changguo Ji Xiaofeng Niu, Hongwei Ye, Mark Winkler, Manabu Teshigawara,  \nYasuhiro Noshi and Daniel Gagnon \n \n Abstract We studied the impacts of CT dose reduction on \nPET quantitation with combination of currently available ntechniques by phantom and human studies on a Toshiba PET/CT \nprototype scanner with TOF capability.  For the phantom \nstudies, an anthropomorphic torso phantom and an IEC \nphantom were scanned using both diagnostic quality CT \nprotocols and dose-reduced CT protocols.  To achieve reduced-\ndose CT scans, we used tube current reduction, spectral shaping, \nhelical pitch optimization and AIDR 3DTM \(Adaptive Iterative \nDose Reduction Then, both the high and low dose acquired CT \nimages were resampled and used to generate attenuation maps \nfor PET.   The CT images, attenuation maps and reconstructed \nPET images were compared between high and low dose CT \nprotocols.  ROI-based analysis for each tissue type was also \nperformed to see the impact of the dose reduction on PET \nquantitative accuracy among different dose protocols. Finally, \nthe selected optimal low dose CT protocol was used for \nattenuation correction in whole-body PET/CT imaging on twelve \npatients.  The PET data were reconstructed with fully 3D list-\nmode TOF ordered-subset expectation maximization algorithm nwith physical corrections of attenuation, scatter, random, \ndetector normalization, decay, duration and dead time. The \nreconstructed PET images show that in PET/CT imaging, the \nPET diagnostic quality could be remained unchanged, while CT \ndose could be dramatically reduced compared to the diagnostic \nprotocol, when CT is not used for diagnostic purpose.  There is \nbig room for CT dose reduction as long as the bias and noise in \nCT could be controlled in an acceptable range without \nintroducing artifacts through CT-based PET attenuation ncorrection.  This study demonstrates that CT could be tailored \nfor the intended purpose in PET/CT imaging to dramatically \nreduce patient radiation dose, while still maintaining high quality \nPET images. \nI INTRODUCTION \nHE combined modality PET/CT has shown great benefits in \noncology for diagnosis, staging and tumor quantitation \nsince the last decade. The CT component in a PET/CT system \ncan provide not only anatomic information for localization, \nbut also attenuation correction for PET images [1-2]. \nRecently, there has been increased attention on the radiation \ndose to patients from ionizing medical imaging [3].

That is to say, in PET/CT imaging, if CT scan is \nperformed for localization and attenuation correction only, the \nCT radiation dose can be dramatically reduced from \ndiagnostic levels [3-6].   \n In this paper, we present a study of the impacts of CT dose \nreduction on PET quantitation with combination of some of nthe currently available techniques. \n The goal of this study is to gain an understanding of the \nimpacts of dramatic reduction of CT radiation dose on \nPET/CT imaging using Toshiba’s PET/CT prototype, and \nprovide general guidelines for future protocol optimization in \npatient PET/CT imaging. \n \nII. METHODS \nWe used a combination of CT dose reduction and noise \nsuppression strategies to reduce CT radiation dose from ndiagnostic level to low dose level. These strategies include: \nCT tube current reduction, CT tube voltage optimization and \nspectral shaping, helical scan pitch optimization and Adaptive \nIterative Dose Reduction AIDR 3DTM  PET/CT prototype \nscanner. The CT subsystem of the prototype scanner has 16-\nslice capability, and the PET subsystem has LYSO crystals \nwith the time-of-flight \(TOF human scanning were performed. \n \nA. Anthropomorphic Head and Torso Phantom Experiment \nFirst of all, an anthropomorphic head and torso phantom \n\(Fig. 1 CTDIvol ranging from 12.7 mGy to 0.4 mGy.  Then, both \nthe high and low dose acquired CT images of the phantom nwere resampled to match the PET image resolution of 2 mm \n\(for brain for torso generating \nattenuation maps for PET. The obtained high dose CT derived \nattenuation map of the anthropomorphic torso phantom \nunderwent a series of image domain post-processing to \ngenerate the noise-free uniform emission object. After that, the \nemission object was used as an input for the PET analytical nsimulator with the effect of attenuation, but without scatter, \nrandom or detector efficiency.  \n nT\n978-1-4799-0534-8/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE\n  \nFig. 1. The anthropomorphic head and torso phantom was scanned with \nToshiba’s PET/CT prototype scanner. \n \nDifferent levels of Poisson noise were applied on the \nemission 


sinogram data, mimicking FDG in water at various \nclinical count levels.  Finally, the simulated PET data were nreconstructed with sinogram-based 3D ordered-subset \nexpectation-maximization \(OSEM subsets \nand 2 iterations.  \n  \n The CT images, attenuation maps and reconstructed PET \nimages for the anthropomorphic phantom were compared \nbetween high and low dose CT protocols.  ROI-based analysis \nfor each tissue type was also performed to see the impact of \nthe dose reduction on PET quantitative accuracy among ndifferent dose protocols. \nB. IEC Phantom Experiment \nThe IEC phantom was scanned on the PET/CT prototype nfollowing NEMA guidelines \(Fig. 2 nwith line source. \n \nIn this experiment, the activity ratio of hot spheres: cold \nspheres: lung: background 4: 0: 0: 1. A cold NU-2 scatter \nphantom with an inserted hot line source was attached to the \nIEC phantom and used to provide out of FOV scatters. The CT \nimages were acquired with protocols from high to low dose nlevels. The acquisition time for PET is 180 sec/bed with 4 \nbeds, 50% overlap between adjacent beds. Then the PET data \nwere reconstructed with list-mode 3D-OSEM \(20 subsets, 2 \niterations corrections of attenuation, \nscatter, random, detector normalization, decay, duration and \ndead time nFinally, the CT images, attenuation maps and reconstructed \nPET images for the IEC phantom were compared and nanalyzed.  ROI-based analysis was also performed. In \naddition, contrast recovery-coefficient \(CRC background \nvariability were calculated and compared among PET images \nfrom different CT dose protocols.  The general data flow of \nthe study for scanner-based data acquisition and analysis were \nshown in Fig. 3 nFig.3. The general data flow of the study for scanner-based data acquisition and analysis. \n C. Patient Scanning \nBased on the comparison among different CT low dose \nprotocols from phantom experiments, one optimal low dose \nCT protocol was selected for attenuation correction in whole-\nbody PET/CT scanning on human objects Twelve patients \nwere scanned on the Toshiba’s PET/CT prototype with whole-\nbody imaging protocol with regular injection dose and \nimaging time, using the selected low dose CT protocol for \nPET attenuation correction. The PET data were reconstructed \nusing the same reconstruction algorithm as the IEC phantom. \nPatients were categorized according to their Body Mass Index \n\(BMI applied \nto the PET images to achieve similar signal-to-noise-ratio in \nsoft-tissue for each BMI. Both PET and CT images of the \nscanned patients were analyzed. \n \nIII. RESULTS \nA.

Fig 5 \nshows the comparison of corresponding attenuation maps \nderived from the same CT protocols. Fig. 6 shows the \ncomparison of reconstructed PET image.  \nAs expected, CT protocols that use the highest tube voltage \nand strongest available beam filtration with reduced tube \ncurrents are most dose-efficient. AIDR 3DTM could reduce CT \ndose even further, suppressing the increased noise at low \nphoton levels.  \nIt can be observed that the combination of CT dose \nreduction and noise suppression strategies could reduce CT \nradiation dose by a factor ~7 from diagnostic level, with \nminimal impacts on PET quantitative accuracy \(< 5% bias ROI-based analysis shows that the pixels in the bony \narea around shoulder and pelvis region will be more nsusceptible to PET bias when photon starvation happens as CT \ndose is dramatically reduced. \n.\n \n150 mAs CTDIvol: 12.2 mGy         25 mAs, CTDIvol: 2.0 mGy       22.5 mAs, CTDIvol: 1.8  mGy      20 mAs, CTDIvol: 1.6 mGy   \nFig. 4.

Patient Scanning \nFig. 10 shows an example of an obese patient’s whole body \nCT image acquired with selected low dose CT protocol, \nattenuation map and corresponding PET image. \n From Fig 10, we see that the diagnostic quality of PET \ncould be remained unchanged, while using selected low dose \nCT protocol.  \n \n \n\(a b n\(c a dose CT protocol, \(b c 240 sec/bed acquisition, 10 subsets, 2 iterations TOF-OSEM reconstruction, \nposter-filtered by Gaussian FWHM 7.3 mm n \n \n\(a b studied the impacts of reducing CT \nradiation dose on PET in PET/CT imaging. We show that CT \nprotocols that use the highest tube voltage and strongest \navailable beam filtration with reduced tube currents are most ndose-efficient. AIDR 3DTM could reduce CT dose even \nfurther, suppressing the increased noise at low photon levels. \nThe reconstructed PET images show that the diagnostic \nquality of PET could be remained unchanged while CT dose \ncould be dramatically reduced compared to the diagnostic \nprotocol, when CT is not used for diagnostic purpose. This \nmay happen with respiratory-gated PET studies of the thorax \n[6, 8-9].   \nUnder the constraint of using clinical feasible CT subsystem \nin the PET/CT scanner, there is still big room for CT dose nreduction as long as the bias and noise in CT could be \ncontrolled in an acceptable range without introducing artifacts \nthrough CT-based PET attenuation correction.

progress is now an issue of effective \ndata analysis rather than data availability. \nContemporary lifestyles of individuals and \ntechnological advancements have resulted in \ngeneration of huge amounts of data in nastounding proportions every hour in the form of \nemails, weblogs, tweets, sensor generated data, \nphone GPS/traffic, video, and text. The data \nsources are mixture of both structured and \nunstructured data formats. Hitherto, large \nvolumes of structured data have been mainly \ncollected, stored and mined using traditional and \nrelational data warehousing technologies. \nHowever, the fast growth of data has resulted in na new breed of analytics called Big Data \nAnalytics to support large scale data analysis \nthat focuses on large volumes of historical and \nnear real-time data. At the core of big data \nresearch are business concepts technologies and \nstatistical techniques necessary to design highly \nscalable systems that can collect process, store \nand analyze large volumes of both structured \nand unstructured data. \nJust like other streams in the data analytics \nfield, research in Big Data Analytics is \napplicable in almost all fields of practice and \nstudy. In areas like healthcare, logistics, \nmarketing, retail and defense, it has become \nimperative to explore and analyze large amount \nof data in ways that supports effective decision \nmaking and strategic management. Such \nresearch and practice is growing rapidly. In the \nfollowing, we describe one project that we are \nworking on currently. \nOne of the nascent research streams in big \ndata analytics is the role of electronic social \nmedia platforms in healthcare delivery. Early \nstudies have established that factors such as \nevolving patient demographics, financial \nconstraints and longer incidence of chronic \ndiseases have enhanced the impact of social \nrelationships in healthcare delivery [15]. Social \nrelationships, which are associative bonds \nestablished between individuals with common \naspirations and for the purpose of giving and nreceiving support, foster disease self-\nmanagement programs that are vital to the \nmanagement of chronic disease. \nEven though healthcare delivery and support \nhas been traditionally made through channels \nsuch as physicians, nurses and other clinical \nexperts, the advent of the Web 2.0 platform has nObserved\n\(months months healthcare delivery strategies in \nthe self-management of chronic disease. In fact, \nsome studies have suggested that traditional \nsources of health management information may \nno longer be enough in providing quality \nhealthcare to patients [4]. Pharmaceutical \ncompanies and other healthcare-related \nbusinesses already market drugs and solicit \nconsumer feedback from social networks about \nnew drugs and disease management options. \nAmong a myriad of health related topics \ndiscussed on social media platforms for instance, \nis the management of chronic diseases such as \nDiabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary \nDisease COPD MDD  offer social support and \ninformation to patients and caregivers. Social \nsupport has been identified as a major factor for \nimproving health outcomes in patients who \nsuffer from various types of illness [3][6]. The nconcept of social support, also sometimes \nreferred to as peer support has been shown to not \nonly help disease prevention, but also fosters \nand promotes general well-being and health \n[15][14][7]. More research needs to be \nconducted to establish the role and effectiveness \nof social media platforms in healthcare delivery.  \nPrevious studies have mostly investigated efforts \nmade by healthcare institutions in using social nmedia as a tool for healthcare management and \ninformation delivery [9]. Armstrong and Powell \n\(2009 that patients value the additional \nsupport they receive from online communities \nand perceive online sources of information \nprovided by lay people as a complement to \ninformation provided by professional healthcare nproviders [1]. In addition, studies have shown \nthat peer-to-peer support creates an enabling \nenvironment for disease self-management. \nHowever, very few studies have investigated \nhow disease management and healthcare support \nare initiated by patients in a social media \ndomain. Patients like to be in contact with others \nwith similar problems in order to draw both \nemotional support and obtain information on \nhow to manage diseases [1].  \nIt has been established that social media \nplatforms are a viable avenue for disease self-\nmanagement. The question, however, still \nremains whether self-management programs \nthrough social media platforms are an effective \nmeans of managing chronic diseases. Disease \nself-management, especially for chronic \ndiseases, can be an important aspect of the \nhealthcare delivery process. Self-management \nprograms are designed as a complement to other \ntreatment methods to put the patients in the \ndriving seat and empower them to take control \nof them health care status. The aim of a self-help \nprogram includes teaching 1 appropriate use of \nmedications, 2 physical \nexercises that help decrease instance of fatigue, \nisolation and pain, 4 ncommunicating with family, peers and clinical \nhealthcare givers. \nThere is a need to investigate the effect of \npeer support and information exchange on social \nmedia in self-managing chronic disease \nconditions in an environment that is not directly \nmediated by a healthcare institution or any \nclinical stakeholder 


Sarasohn-Kahn \(2008 media \nplatform is known to be at par in terms of \nquality with what would be provided by any \nsingle expert on a subject matter [12]. The same \nis true for clinical information provided by other \nusers on a social networking platform. Hence, \nbesides the healthcare advice from expert \nclinicians such as doctors, the advice and \nsupport provided on social media platforms by \nnon-expert patients is vital to the achieving of \nthe necessary health goals that needs to be \nattained by patients.  \nAs the focus of traditional health informatics \nshifts from health professionals to consumers, \nBig data research assumes a vital role because it ngives one the opportunity and flexibility to \nanalyze extremely huge amounts of data rather \nthan just a small sample and make inferences \nand decisions on the use and delivery of \nhealthcare on social media platforms. Big Data \nresearch also delves into in-depth analysis and \ndrawing of deeper conclusions on data generated \nfrom other domains of study. The highly \nscalable platform used for Big Data analytics is nnecessitated by three fundamental characteristics \nof data sources; volume, velocity and variety. \nBig Data research looks at how to analyze data \nin different domains with such characteristics \nand in a way that generate deeper knowledge \nand adds value to the decision making process in \nbusinesses.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nTeaching Perspectives \n \nIn any knowledge intensive industry such as \nanalytics, the fundamental strength comes from nhaving students who are interested in the \ntechnology and choose that industry as their \nprofession Universities play a key role in \nmaking this possible. Academic programs that \nprepare professionals for the industry are being \nstarted virtually everywhere. These programs \nspan various components of business schools nsuch as information systems, marketing, \nmanagement sciences, etc. Such programs are \nalso emerging far beyond business schools to \ninclude computer science, statistics, \nmathematics, and industrial engineering ndepartments across the world. These programs \nalso include training of graphics developers who \ndesign new ways of visualizing information. \nUniversities are offering undergraduate and \ngraduate programs in Analytics in all of these \ndisciplines, though they may be labeled \ndifferently.  A major growth frontier has been ncertificate programs in analytics to enable \ncurrent professionals to retrain and retool \nthemselves for analytics careers.  Certificate \nprograms enable practicing analysts to gain \nbasic proficiency in specific software by taking a \nfew critical courses. Power \(2012 analytics, \nbut there are likely many more such programs, \nwith new ones being added daily [11].  Watson n\(2013 programs [17]. \nAnother group of players assist in \ndeveloping competency in the field of analytics. \nThese are certification programs awarding a \ncertificate of expertise in specific software.  \nVirtually every major technology provider \n\(IBM, Microsoft, Microstrategy, Oracle, SAS, \nTeradata, etc nprograms. These certificates ensure that \npotential new hires have a certain level of tool \nskills. On the other hand, INFORMS has just \nintroduced a Certified Analytics Professional \n\(CAP aimed at \ntesting an individual’s general analytics \ncompetency.  Any of these certifications give a \ncollege student additional marketable skills.    \nMany of these industry leaders also have \nacademic alliance programs to enable teaching \ntheir software etc.  IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, \nSAP, and Teradata have major initiatives that \nallow faculty members to share software as well \nas other teaching materials.

Faculty members contribute \nsuch resources to TUN. Even teaching notes are \navailable for many of the teaching materials.  A \nrecent addition is several videos that depict \nanalytics applications in realistic settings. These \nvideos have been developed by Dr David \nSchrader of Teradata.

You are given information about \ncustomers’ profiles and relationship with the \nairline. Your decisions might change as you \nlearn more about those customers’ profiles.  \nWatch the video, pause it as appropriate, and \nanswer the questions on which passengers \nshould be given priority.

There are almost a dozen such \nvideos available through TUN. There are also nhundreds of other teaching resources available \non TUN.   \n \n  \nConclusion \n \nOverall, there is much to be excited about \nthe analytics industry at this point. As illustrated \nin this paper, descriptive, predictive and \nprescriptive analytics applications and research \nopportunities are wide and growing. Research in \nBig Data is also growing.

CONCLUSION \n \nIn this paper, we suggested a network aware Hadoop \nperformance model and explored its scalability with the model. \nOur experimental results showed that the model could predict a \njob’s execution with 5 % average error compared to the real \njob measurement within up to 4 rack 160 server clusters in nresolution of second. We could explain the cause of the real job \nmeasurement pattern under various conditions with the model. \nIn addition, with the model, we explored the Hadoop \nscalability characteristic in large clusters under various inter-\nswitch bandwidths and a numbers of reduces which are \nimportant for the scalability. By using the result, we showed \nHadoop scales out well in the typical cluster network nconfigurations, and suggested guidelines for application design \nand Hadoop scalability improvement. \n A 160 server cluster is a sufficiently large cluster for most \nof newly joined users to big data analysis without sufficient \nbudget for cluster and experience. Our model contributes the \nusers to save cost by assisting to analyzing potential of their \ncluster before adding a new server.  \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] J. Dean and S.

desired\nlevel of accuracy by simply increasing the number of steps.\nIn particular, any of Messac’s canonical satisfaction function\ncan be modeled [31].\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can enter\none-of-a-kind requirement satisfaction rules. However, a\nspreadsheet-based user interface was implemented for rapid\ncoding of multi-step satisfaction functions, which have all the\nsame structure.\nStep 3a Aggregate Requirement Satisfaction—The prefer-\nence domain is hyperdimensional because there is at least one\ndimension per requirement, and in a complex system there\ncan easily be several hundreds or even thousands of require-\nments. Dominated architectures could easily be eliminated\nby means of Pareto analysis, but this is unlikely to reduce\nthe size of the tradespace by much due to the large number\nof requirements. Hence, the problem remains of choosing\nbetween architectures that have very different requirement\n10\nFigure 10. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3a: Aggregate satisfaction\nsatisfaction sets, but seem globally equally attractive. In prac-\ntice, the dimensionality of this domain needs to be reduced in\norder to be able to make a decision concerning the preferred\narchitectures. This requires the use of subjective information\ncapturing stakeholder preferences.\nHence, the last step of the methodology is the reduction of the\ndimensionality of the preference domain through aggregation\nof requirement \(i.e., subobjective then into stakeholder satisfaction. This two-\nstep aggregation process requires the elicitation of a list of\nobjectives and subobjectives from different stakeholders, and\nreduces the dimensionality of the preference domain \(i.e., the\nnumber of metrics Nsh\nto 1 if the relative importance of stakeholders to a central\nstakeholder is introduced. The relative importance of stake-\nholders can be formally computed by applying quantitative\nstakeholder analysis techniques e.g. stakeholder networks\n[32 represents the value of the system\narchitecture to the central stakeholder. The entire process is\nillustrated in Figure 10.\nMathematically, requirement aggregation rules reduce the\ndimensionality of the satisfaction space by using aggregation\nfunctions. Aggregation functions combine arithmetic and\nlogical operators. The simplest and most commonly used\narithmetic operator is the weighted average. For example, the\nsatisfaction of a stakeholder is given by a weighted average\nof the satisfaction of its objectives. More sophisticated arith-\nmetic operators are also possible \(see for example Yager’s\nordered weighted averaging operator or Fortin’s gradual num-\nbers [33], [34 type, such as the at-least-n-out-of-\nk condition: “the stakeholder is satisfied if 3 or more of these\n4 objectives are satisfied.”\nIn the VASSAR methodology, the system architect can man-\nually define one-of-a-kind aggregation functions. Weighted\naverages can be rapidly coded in from a spreadsheet-based\nuser interface.\nStep 3b: Prepare Explanations—The VASSAR methodology\nprovides a set of explanations that accompany the fuzzy value\nmetric. This is central to the methodology, as it satisfies one\nof its key requirements, namely that of showing traceability\nof the value delivery loop. Explanation rules keep track of\nTable 3.

CASE STUDY\nWe selected a hypothetical soil moisture remote sensing\nsatellite mission as the case study to show the applicability\nthe VASSAR methodology. This hypothetical mission would\ncombine instruments that are similar to real instruments flown\nor to be flown in NASA and ESA missions References to\nthese missions will be made as required. This example was\ndesigned to illustrate different features of the methodology:\n\(1 elements of subjectivity, which are hard to\nmodel in traditional design tools;\n\(2 emergent behavior that actu-\nally drives an important part of the value delivery;\n\(3 of complexity, as it is complex\nenough to yield non-trivial results, but simple enough to avoid\nthe need to provide excessive background.\nPayload description\nFor this example we consider five candidate instruments:\na an L-band polarimetric radiometer \(LRADIO synthetic\naperture radar \(LSAR XRADIO IR P-band polarimetric\nSAR \(PSAR mass, power data rate, performance tradespace\nFor this example, we chose to represent an architecture as\nthe set of decisions laid out in Table 


3. The set of possible\narchitectures is given by the Cartesian product of the ranges\nof values in Table 3 which consists of 3,636 architectures.\n11\nFigure 11. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3b: Prepare explanations\nStakeholder requirements\nFive stakeholder groups or panels were identified for this\nexample, labeled as follows: weather climate, ecosystems,\nwater, and applications. All five panels were initially con-\nsidered equally important; a case with non-uniform weights\nis considered later in the sensitivity analysis. Note that the\npanels’ relative weights could be obtained through a formal\nmethod such as the one proposed by Cameron et al [32].\nThe specific objectives of each panel, as well as their relative\nranking, are provided in Appendix B.\nCapability rules\nNominal instrument capabilities are presented in Appendix\nA. However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters. Below are\na few examples of situations in which data quality is severely\ncompromised due to orbital parameters.\nLighting conditions—Visible and NIR instruments \(namely\nthe corresponding channels of the IR radiometer node because they cannot gather\nenough light.\nImage distortion—Side-looking instruments cannot work at\nlow altitudes because image distortion becomes unaccept-\nable.\nEmergence rules\nEmergent behavior plays a key role in value delivery to\nstakeholders. We describe in this subsection a few examples\nof emergent behavior \(both in science and cost spatial\nresolution soil moisture dataset provided by LRADIO can be\ncombined with the lower accuracy, higher spatial resolution\ndataset provided by LSAR to produce a new high accuracy,\nmedium spatial resolution dataset.\nSample averaging—In any dataset, part of the non-systematic\nerror can be reduced by averaging samples in time or space,\nthus effectively creating a new dataset that trades accuracy\nagainst spatial or temporal resolution.\nLevel-4 data products—A level-4 net carbon ecosystem ex-\nchange dataset can be created from the combination of a\nlevel-3 soil moisture dataset and several ancillary products,\nnamely land surface temperature, vegetation state, and land-\ncover status.\nMultispectral measurements—IR and MW snow and ice cover\ndatasets can be combined to produce new, multispectral, more\naccurate datasets.\nSharing a common dish—The L-band radar and radiometer\ncan share a common antenna thus effectively reducing the\ntotal mass of the system.\nLearning Curve—If several identical satellites are developed\nand fabricated, the marginal cost of the second and subse-\nquent units is lower than the cost of the first unit due to\nlearning.\nResults\nThe set of 3,636 architectures was evaluated using VASSAR.\nThe benefit portion is based on the set of requirements from\nAppendix B. The cost portion is based on the cost model de-\nscribed in Appendix C. The point science scores and lifecycle\ncost estimates for all these architectures are shown on Figure\n12. These numbers are obtained from defuzzyfying the fuzzy\n12\nFigure 12. Expected science vs expected lifecycle cost for\n3,636 architectures \(uniform weights analysis—The main goal of any system architect-\ning tool is to gain insight into the “shape” of the tradespace,\nwhat the main trades are, whether there are families of\narchitectures, and so on. We observe several features just by\nlooking at the tradespace in Figure 12:\n\(1 a science score\nof 0. This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate. An example of the latter is when a side-\nlooking instrument is put at 400km, resulting in a too large\nimage distortion.\n\(2 unresolvable conflicting require-\nments. In this particular case, most of the observations\nrequire a SSO in order to get rid of diurnal variations in radi-\nance. However, a small subset of requirements that concern\noceanography or cryospheric measurements are ideally taken\nin true polar, non-SSO orbits, in order to avoid tidal aliasing\n\(oceanography cryosphere it is impossible to be in a polar\nand SSO orbit simultaneously, some value is going to be lost\nno matter what decision is made.\n\(3 costs. This is a typical behavior in\narchitectural tradespaces, that has its origins in the non-linear\nmapping between capabilities and satisfaction, namely in the\nquantization of satisfaction levels. In other words slightly\ndifferent performances may be perceived as equivalent in\nterms of satisfaction by stakeholders.\nExplanation facility—The explanation facility provides sup-\nport for more advanced analysis of the tradespace. Examples\nof the features of the explanation facility are listed below:\n\(1 The explanation facility provides\ndetailed explanations of the scores of an architecture in text\nformat as required by the user. An example of such informa-\ntion is provided in Table 4.\n\(2 support: The explanation facility\ncan provide information about one or more architectures on\nFigure 13 


Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy results—We emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., “Most” or “Some larger.\nSensitivity Analysis—There are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis.

Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17. This kind of results can be useful to determine the\noptimal evolution of an architecture, such as in determining\nan optimal descoping option in the event of a downward\nbudget.\n15\nTable 6.

Local search around architecture #669, high-\nlighted on Table 5\n4 CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a methodology to assess the value\nof a system architecture using RBES Such methodology can\nbe used in the context of automatic architectural tradespace\nexploration to develop the part of computational tools that\nautomatically evaluates the architectures being generated. An\nexample of such tool was shown in the context of Earth Ob-\nserving Satellite Systems \(EOSS is\ndivided in two parts. First, the advantages and disadvantages\nof VASSAR with respect to the state-of-the-art of system\narchitecting tools is discussed. Second, the next steps in this\nresearch project are outlined.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of VASSAR\nThe following are advantages  the\nVASSAR methodology with respect to other frameworks:\n\(1  delivery\nloop. All requirements are directly traceable to stakeholder\nneeds. All capabilities are directly traceable to architectural\ndecisions.\n\(2  e.g., sci-\nence and engineering back-\ngrounds, simply because it is the way in which the human\nmind works.\n\(3  the domain-specific\nknowledge from the domain-independent knowledge, which\ntranslates into increased scalability and reusability, and facil-\nitates task allocation between system architects and software\nengineers.\n\(4  lessons learned: it serves as\na repository of knowledge to conserve expertise, and it also\nuses the lessons learned in the form of logical rules to evaluate\nsystem architectures.\n\(5  delivery loop facilitates more\n16\noptimal task allocation between man \(the system architect the computational tool architectures and through the use of the text-\nbased and graphics-based explanation facility. The system\narchitect feeds the tool with knowledge, guides the tradespace\nexploration process, and makes all non-objective decisions.\n\(6  of recursive algorithms, which\nare at the core of modeling emergence, which in turn is the\norigin of value.\n\(7  8  a computational price, which is only\nworth it if the knowledge base is likely to evolve.\n\(9  slow when the number of rules is very\nlarge.\n\(10  the expert knowledge \(e.g. lessons learned specific\npurpose: evaluating system architectures in the context of\nautomatic architectural tradespace exploration. Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSAR’s\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
