Indirect methods of gauging the usage of \nsoftware installed in the mainframe environment are used \nto measure the usage of products, making it difficult to \nobtain information to renew these products. This paper \npresents the z/Audit product, which offers information on \nthe actual usage of the programs installed in the \nmainframe environment. The product features data \nextration for mining \(data mining analytics z/OS Environment, Data Mining, Information \nAnalysis. \n \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \nWith the advent of various technologies that have become \nmore and more present in our lives, the institutions have been \nforced to invest heavily in products capable of keeping up \nwith the fast rhythm of providing services to clients [1 This \nresults in the purchase or contract of software to meet this \ndemand. These contracts comprise a high percentage of the \nbudget invested in Information Technology \(IT lot of software that can \naudit the environment and verify the effective usage of the \nproducts installed. In closed environments, mainly those that \nuse z/OS operating systems - IBM's operating system - finding nevidence of the usage of all these contracted or purchased \nsoftware is really difficult, since fewer professionals are \ndevoting themselves to the development of products in these \nmarkets. Also, the construction of algorithms that can capture \nand analyze a great volume of data in these environments has nbecome even more complex [2]. \nWithout this evidence of usage, the contracting companies are \nforced to apply indirect methods for gauging the usage, which \nnot always represent reality. We can have cases of contracted nproducts that have been rarely used, but that are always \nrenewed because users understand that they are essential to the \ninstitution, when, in fact, they are not. \nThe z/AUDIT product, idealized from research and disentailed \nfrom IT businesses, was developed with the intention to help \ncompanies understand the actual usage of their computer \nsystem's infrastructure regarding the contracted software, and, \nfor this reason, the companies make use of Big Data's inherent \nconcepts. Obviously, the part of data collection is done in a \nz/OS mainframe environment, but all data processing \(data \nmining and analytics nenvironment, so that it does not bring more costs into this \nenvironment. \n \n \nII. THE Z/OS ENVIRONMENT \nTo identify the products installed in the environment, \ninformation is extracted from the CSIs \(Consolidated nInventory Software Software Modification Program Extended such \nas product, programs and installed libraries are obtained.  \nInformation extraction can also be performed by means of \nproducts that do not make use of SMP/E in their installation \nand maintenance processes 3]. \nThe algorithm behind the collection of z/OS makes intensive \nuse of access to control blocks by means of a technique known \nas ACCESS REGISTER MODE, which is much less invasive \nand is also fast, not demanding the use of old CROSS MODE \nresources, such as SRB \(Service Request Blocks data collected is performed by means of \nVSAM files, ERDS type, which is one of the fastest access \nmethods in the z/OS environment.  We are referring to a \n2013 IEEE 16th International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering\n978-0-7695-5096-1/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CSE.2013.167\n1140\nvolume of nearly 6 million registers generated per hour, in \nonly one partition or z/OS image. It is important to point out \nthat in this collection only the names of the programs are \ncaptured; and never the data manipulated by these programs. \n \n \nIII. MINING \nOnce data are collected in the mainframe environment, they \nare sent to PENTAHO servers, where, through a series of \nroutines [4], a consolidation is carried out, so as to identify \nand associate the programs involved and the products to which \nthey belong. This routine processes millions of registers in \norder to inform the degree of usage of each product installed. \nIt is important to point out that we are referring to product \nusage, and not product performance. The algorithm that \nPENTAHO servers use is designed to answer only one \nquestion: what is the degree of usage of the software installed? \nAt this moment, we do not have the intention to answer this \nquestion, or to correlate this usage with the processing ncapacity consumption during the usage of this software. \nA database was especially designed to store the data related to \nthe questions regarding the degree of usage, in percentage \nvalues, so that these questions can be easily answered [5]. \nFigure 1 shows the data model of the solution. \n \n \n \nFig. 1 - data model of the solution \n \nIV. PRESENTATION \nA WEB interface, easily manipulated and predicting easy \nnavigation, was 


developed in JAVA environment, using a \nTOMCAT application server [6]. We can see the concern in \nsupplying a low-cost solution of high added value, since both \nmining products \(data mining n\(analytics nnowadays, regarding the cost of software. Figure 2 shows the \npresentation layer of the product. \n \n \nFig. 2 Presentation layer of the product \n \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nWith the use of the z/AUDIT product, many of the answers \nfrom the people responsible for the financial department can \nbe obtained without a direct interference from the IT \ndepartment. The information supplied can also allow for a \nbetter approach at the time of negotiation with numerous \nsuppliers. It is interesting to observe that these pieces of \ninformation bring a very expensive concept to the economic \nenvironment, which is information symmetry. Without the use nof a product like z/AUDIT, only one of the negotiating parties \ngets to know the real importance \(or not a product. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] Data, data everywhere. a special report on managing \ninformation.

participated in problem-\nsolving under a group collaborative environment. During the \nprocess of problem-solving, students reflected the knowledge \n[4] gained from the lectures and applied their knowledge nwithin their groups. Alternatively, students engaged in \nmetacognitive activity  in that students involved in the \ncognitive mode of conscious thinking, analyzing, and learning \nthrough the reflection of the knowledge and experience earned \nin the past [7]. \nThe rest of the core categories represent unconscious \nlearning. In other words, we contend that unconscious learning \nincorporates student’s recognition of database complexities in \nthe Facebook’s online games, student’s realization of database \nfunctionalities in the real world, and student’s discovery of \nERD as a visualization tool for team communication.  \nWe assert that the learning outcomes of unconscious \nlearning enable students to perceive the usability of Entity-\nRelationship Diagram ERD appreciate their initial learning objectives \(conscious \nlearning sophistication \nof database \(unconscious learning that the initial learning \nobjectives \(conscious learning appreciation and justification of their conscious \nlearning efforts. This draws parallel with the previous studies \nsuggesting that students will appreciate learning when they \nperceive the pedagogical objectives as worthwhile [2].  \nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH \nSince this is a research-in-progress, this study only nuncovers the preliminary finding. That is, in the Facebook’s \nonline gaming platform, a combination of intentional/conscious \nand unintentional/unconscious learning of database design \npromotes student learning Conscious learning fosters the \ncognitive reflection of database design knowledge. Not only \nthe unconscious learning sheds light on the critical role of \ndatabase in online games but also helps learners to appreciate nthe learning objectives and justify their efforts invested in \nconscious learning.  \nAt the preliminary stage, the research implication suggests \nthat Game-Based Learning \(GBL nfacilitating authentic experience that leads learners to discover \nthe elements in support of their original learning goals. In the \nfuture study, we plan to run pre-test and post-test studies and \ncompare the student learning outcomes between the students \nwho have experienced GBL and those who have not. Overall, \nthis is a research-in-progress so more in-depth study is required \nto yield meaningful findings for improving student learning. \nREFERENCES \n[1] E. M. Boyd and A. W.

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS \nCompared with subscribing method, the fully distributed \ndata collection shifts the pressure from network to local \nresources. Therefore, we focus on examining the \n16832\nperformance impact to the simulation application on the \nsame host. The test environment includes several common \nPC machines in a LAN. The hosts use Intel core CPU, 2GB \nof memory, 500GB of hard disk and 1Gbps of network. \nSoftware platform use Windows XP, pRTI 1516 V3.2, \nJDK1.6, Hadoop 0.20.2 HBase0.92.2 and Cygwin1.7.17. \nThe prototype is implemented in Java language. A custom \nserialization of the original data from RTI call is used for \nperformance optimization. \nThe test measures the extra time by turning on data \ncollection in contrast to without collection. Priority-based \nscheduling is also tested for comparing. The initial test was \ndesigned for the goal of SDG, about one gigabyte level per \nhour per node 6]. The goal was set up before 2006 and the \ndata size has been increasing rapidly, so 10 gigabytes level is nalso considered \(see Fig. 6 represents the time to complete the \nsimulation. From 10 to 100 KB per tick, the data generating \nrate is from about 2 to 15 gigabytes per hour. The test result \nindicates that we gain a little superiority when the amount of \ndata is small. \nThe next test measures the performance with strain \nresources. Two federates are deployed in each host and time \nadvances as soon as possible. About 2 gigabytes data are \nlogged in less than 5 minutes. The test runs with multi-times \n\(see Fig. 7 less and the priority scheduling is unstable - \naccidentally it is better than fuzzy scheduling while takes nmore time in most cases. \n\n\n\n\n 


each relevant trigger is selected\nas a candidate point in its appropriate quadrant. For triggers\nwhich do not completely lie inside the grid cell, the inter-\nsection points of the cell boundary and the trigger spatial\nregion are considered as candidate points instead of the corner\npoints which fall outside the grid cell. Secondly, for trigger\nspatial regions which intersect the x-axis or y-axis of the\ncoordinate axes with origin at \(a1, a2 points.\nThe algorithm trims the set of candidate points in the next\nstep. Firstly, in case multiple candidate points in a quadrant\nintersect the x-axis \(or y-axis or y-axis present on the x-axis, the point of intersection of the x-axis\nand the cell is added to the candidate point set. Further, we\nremove points which fully dominate any other point from the\ncandidate set. A point P1 is said to fully dominate point P2 if\nabs\(P1.x P2.x P1.y P2.y according to increasing distance of the x-\ncoordinate from the origin. Points with the same x-coordinate\nare arranged in order of decreasing distance of y-coordinate\nfrom origin.\nThe set of candidate points is then processed to obtain\nthe set of tension points. Each tension point TQi, where\nQ ? {1, 2, 3, 4} represents the quadrant the point belongs\nto, is assigned the same x-coordinate as the corresponding\ncandidate point CQi. TQi is assigned the same y-coordinate\nas that of CQi?1, or TQi?1 if TQi and TQi?1 have the same\nx-coordinate. The y-coordinate of TQ1 is set as either the top\nbound of the cell or the y-coordinate of a candidate point\nintersecting the y-axis if any.\nThe set of tension points form the opposite corner \(opposite\nto the origin composed\nof the intersection of the component rectangles from each\nquadrant. As opposed to an optimal solution which enumerates\nevery possible combination of component rectangles and com-\nputes metrics for each combination thus taking quartic time,\nour approach performs greedy decisions. We refer readers\nto our technical report [14] for a detailed discussion of the\nvarious heuristics.\nFigure 5 shows an example of our safe value container\ncomputation approach. The candidate point set for the given\nscenario is as shown in Figure 5\(a trimmed from the candidate point set as explained\nabove. Figure 5\(b obtained\nfrom the candidate point set. Figure 5\(c few of the tension points.\nThe final rectangular safe value container is composed out\nof these component rectangles. Extension of this approach to\nlarger dimensional spaces may lead to expensive computations.\nFor example, three-dimensional spaces would require the\nprocessing of relevant points in each octant of the coordinate\nsystem. However, intuitively SLIM will benefit more for higher\ndimensionality data in terms of lower computation costs when\ncompared to the gain in performance experienced for single\nor two-dimensional data simply due to lower selectivity of the\npredicate ranges for the triggers in higher dimensions Our\nexperimental evaluation is limited to two-dimensional spaces\nand we observe these trends for single-dimensional and two-\ndimensional data.\nVI. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of the SLIM\nsystem to exhibit the benefits of our safe containment tech-\nniques. We benchmark the performance of the SLIM approach\n54\n\(a b with\nvarying fraction of public triggers\nagainst three different approaches: in-transit processing \(INT processes all data updates in the order of their arrival,\nrandom update dropping \(RND container\napproach applied to the spatial attribute \(SR approach which\nprocesses data on arrival to scale with the increasing number of\nusers/triggers in the system The RND approach displays the\ninability of a random update dropping approach in activating\ntriggers with high accuracy. We study the performance of these\ntechniques based on the following metrics: 1 These are measured as a combination of trigger eval-\nuation costs and safe value container computation costs 2 wireless environ-\nment where high communication costs also lead to high energy\nconsumption on the mobile client. 3 sequence of triggers which should be activated are\ndetermined by the in-transit processing approach. We relax the\nreal-time processing requirements for this approach in order\nto determine the trigger activation sequence.\nA. Experimental Setup\nWe simulate the proposed mobile information monitoring\nsystem using an event-based simulator. The simulator gener-\nates a trace of vehicles moving on a real-world road network\nusing maps available from the National Mapping Division of\nthe U.S. Geological Survey [15]. Vehicles are randomly placed\non the road network, according to traffic densities determined\nfrom the traffic volume data in [16 ensuring appropriate\ntraffic densities on different road types. We use a map of\nAtlanta and surrounding 


regions, which covers an area around\n1000 km2 in expanse, to generate the trace. Our experiments\nuse traces generated by simulating vehicle movement for a\nperiod of one hour with results averaged over a number of such\ntraces. Default values allow us to simulate the movement of\na set of 10,000 vehicles with each vehicle generating location\nupdates with a period of 1 second.\nThe other part of the simulator models multiple data sources\ngenerating data relevant to the locations of interest. A default\nset of 10,000 locations of interest are distributed over the entire\nmap with multiple hotspots. The data arrival at the information\nmonitoring server is modeled as a poisson process; hence, the\ninterarrival times are exponentially distributed. A maximum\nof twenty data sources are considered in the system with a\n\(a b a grid cell size for two-dimensional\nsafe value containers. \(b for\nsingle-dimensional safe value containers.\ndifferent set of attributes monitored at each location of interest.\nThe default trigger information consists of a set of 10,000\ntriggers with private, shared and public triggers installed in\nthe system determining the number of triggers relevant to each\nclient. We consider a dynamically changing trigger set where\ntriggers are inserted and deleted periodically.\nB. Experimental Results\n1 in-transit processing\nand random dropping approaches. We vary the fraction of\npublic triggers from 0.01 to 0.2 and study the performance\nof the in-transit processing approach \(INT drop probabilities of 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8\n\(RND 0.2, RND 0.5, RND 0.8 0.01, we have around 101 relevant triggers per\nsubscriber in the system. On increasing this to 0.2, we have\nmore than 2000 relevant triggers per subscriber installed at the\nserver.\nFigure 6\(a for each approach as we\nvary the fraction of public triggers. It can be observed from the\nfigure that the in-transit approach is not at all scalable even for\nthe lowest fraction of public triggers as it requires nearly 200\nminutes of CPU time to process data received over 60 minutes.\nFigure 6\(b for each approach and\nshows that this approach has 100% success rate. However, this\napproach will start dropping updates due to the heavy load on\nthe server. A simple alternative is to randomly drop updates\nas they are received at the server. Figure 6\(a different\ndrop probabilities. The CPU load reduces as we increase the\ndrop probability for the random dropping approach. However,\neven with very high drop probability of 0.8 the system is\nnot scalable for higher fraction of public triggers. For low\nfraction of public triggers the success rate is unacceptable\n\(Figure 6\(b this approach fails spectacularly for a\npersonalized service. Safe value container approaches rectify\nthe situation by allowing the system to determine and drop\nupdates which do not activate relevant triggers.\n2 Determining Range Block Size and Grid Cell Size:\nFigure 7\(a of\nupdate messages received at the server for a location data\nstream utilizing the two-dimensional safe value container com-\nputation algorithm. A total of 60 million update messages are\n55\n\(a b comparison for in-transit, spatial safe value con-\ntainer and SLIM with \(a sources. \(b shows\nthe results for evaluation time as we vary the grid cell size\nfrom 0.1 km2 to 10 km2, plotted on the left y-axis. There are\ntwo costs involved in the system: two-dimensional safe value\ncontainer computation cost and the location update evaluation\ncost for mobile clients positioned outside their current safe\nvalue container.\nWe can observe from the figure that the safe value container\ncomputation cost first slowly decreases as we increase the grid\ncell size. This is due to lower number of safe value container\ncomputations being performed for larger grid cell sizes. As the\ngrid cell size is increased, a larger number of triggers in the\nvicinity of the user are considered, allowing for computation\nof larger safe value containers. This leads to lower number\nof messages being processed at the server for larger grid cell\nsizes as mobile clients stay within the safe value container for\nlonger time periods. The number of messages processed are\nplotted on the right y-axis. However, with increasing grid cell\nsizes, each safe value container computation becomes more\nexpensive as it considers a larger number of trigger regions.\nFor the largest grid cell size of 10 km2 each safe value\ncontainer computation is expensive enough to outweigh the\neffect of lower number of safe value container computations\nbeing performed. The location update evaluation costs decline\nwith increasing grid cell sizes as fewer number of messages\nare evaluated at the server. The overall computation costs are\nlowest for a grid cell size of 2.5 km2 as visible from the\nfigure. Figure 7\(b messages as we vary the range block size for single-\ndimensional data on the left y-axis. The safe value container\ncomputation costs steadily decline as we increase the range\nblock size. Again, this is due to fewer number of messages\nbeing processed at the server with increasing range block size,\nas plotted on the right y-axis. Larger range block sizes allow us\nto compute safe value containers of larger extent which leads\nto 


fewer number of data updates being processed at the server.\nEven though the cost of each safe value container computation\nincreases with increasing range block size, the overall safe\nvalue container computation costs slowly decline. Data update\nevaluation costs also decrease with increasing range block size.\nRange block size of 50% has lowest total processing costs.\n3 of achieving 100% trigger activation success rate.\nThe following experiment considers only those approaches\nAverage \nUpdate \nPeriod \n\(seconds messages in \nmillions messages in nmillions  f\n\(a seconds n\(m\nin\nut\nes\n b Performance comparison of single vs. multiple safe value\ncontainers with varying update period.\nwhich can meet this criteria and studies the performance of\nSLIM in comparison with in-transit processing \(INT value container approach applied to spatial data alone\n\(SR a approach\noutperforms in-transit processing as well as the SR approach\nas we increase the number of monitored sources from 10 to\n20. The SR approach does not handle the increasing number\nof monitored data updates effectively. The SLIM approach\nshows that interaction of spatial and non-spatial data attributes\nfurther enhances system scalability. SLIM outperforms in-\ntransit processing by a margin of around 25 times and the\nSR approach by a margin of 7-10 times. Due to interaction\nbetween attributes from different data sources, the SLIM\napproach exhibits scalability even as we increase the number\nof data sources. The SR approach fails to exploit the effects\nof this interaction between multiple attributes.\nFigure 8\(b increasing the number of\nusers and triggers \(both from 10,000 to 30,000 with 1% of the\ntriggers as public the system while keeping the number of\nmonitored sources constant at 10.

The SR approach is also scalable here as the\nmonitored data evaluation costs remain the same. However it\nrequires a large number of evaluations to be performed for the\nmonitored data updates. SLIM is able to drop a large fraction\nof the monitored data updates and performs 25-45 times better\nthan the INT approach. SLIM also performs 6-8 times better\nthan the SR approach, the margin between the approaches\ndecreases with increasing number of users and triggers.\n4 S M performance\nof the two approaches for safe value container computation\nfor single-dimensional data, namely single and multiple safe\nvalue container computation.

At high data frequency \(low update period the single and multiple approaches is nominal.\nHowever, as we increase the update period, a significant gap\nappears between the number of updates processed by the\napproaches. This is due to the data values jumping between\nthe multiple safe value containers leading to significantly\nlarger number of dropped updates. Figure 9\(b multiple safe value container\n56\napproach does not perform significantly worse than the single\nsafe value container approach, although the container com-\nputation times for this approach are a little higher Similar\nresults are experienced as we increase the rate of change of\ndata values [11].\nVII. RELATED WORK\nAn event-based location reminder system has been advo-\ncated by many human computer interaction projects 17],\n[18], [19]. In the realm of information monitoring, event-based\nsystems have been developed to deliver relevant information\nto users on demand [20]. The SLIM system also needs to\ndeal with the complexity of monitoring continuously changing\ndata from multiple data sources in order to trigger relevant\nalerts in a non-intrusive manner. [21] provides a brief survey\non continuous distributed monitoring. Different flavors of\nmonitoring distributed data have been proposed [22], [23] but\nnone aim to utilize interaction between multiple attributes.\nIn the field of location-based queries, periodic reevaluation\napproach is commonly used for continuous monitoring of\nmoving objects [24], [25]. The SLIM system differs from this\nwork in two aspects Firstly, our installed spatial triggers do\nnot demand periodic evaluation or reevaluation like continuous\nqueries; instead they require one-shot evaluation which should\nresult in a notification being sent to the user when the\ntrigger activation conditions are satisfied. Secondly, unlike the\nSLIM system, none of the previous work explores interaction\nbetween different attributes for information processing in mo-\nbile systems. Streaming data processing optimizations include\nbatch processing methods [7] or approximation processing [6]\nto handle the large amounts of data. Fortunately, our problem\ndefines a finite number of objects for which an infinite amount\nof continuously evolving information is being delivered. This\nmakes it possible to store data corresponding to each object\nin the form of its safe value container.\nVIII CONCLUSION\nWe have presented the SLIM service as an efficient solution\nfor the mobile information monitoring 


problem in presence\nof non-spatial attributes. This paper makes three important\ncontributions towards efficiently solving the information mon-\nitoring problem in presence of spatial as well as non-spatial\nattributes. First, we show that the addition of less dynamic\nnon-spatial attributes to the mobile information mix provides\nopportunities to enhance system scalability beyond what is\npossible with spatial attributes alone. Second, we use safe\ncontainment which allows us to perform selective processing\nof data updates by seeking cooperation from data sources in\nthe information monitoring process but provides savings in\ncommunication costs. Last but not the least, we conduct ex-\ntensive experimental evaluation for a real world road network-\nbased simulator which shows that our approach makes the\nservice scalable.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe last author is partially supported by grants from NSF\nCISE NetSE and SaTC program and an IBM faculty award.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.

the effects of different recommendation radii on the\nperformance of the four schemes in terms of the average\nactual detour ratio from 8AM to 9AM of a weekday. We in-\ncrease the recommendation radius from 50 meters to 250\n446\n9meters, which increases the size of potential taxicabs that\ncan be recommended. Heuristic is not affected by such an\nincrease, since it only recommends the closest taxicab. Ran-\ndom is not signi?cantly affected, since it recommends a\ntaxicab based a random selection. But with the increase of\nradius, both Advanced and Basic have better actual detour\nratios, because a large recommendation radius gives them\nmore taxicabs to select for a better recommendation. Also,\nwith the increase of radius, Advanced always outperforms\nBasic, which con?rms our observations in the previous\nsubsections.\n2 Different Radii: Figure 16 shows\nthe effects of different recommendation radii on percentage of\nreduced total mileage from 8-9 of a weekday. With the increase\nof the radius from 50 meters to 250 meters, the performance of\nboth versions of CallCab increases, while those of Random\nand Heuristic stay the same. But when the radius is close to\n250M, the increase for both versions of CallCab slows down,\nwhich is because the radius is large enough to have a suf?cient\nnumber of taxicabs for recommendations, and an even larger\nradius would not help.\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nRandom\nHeuristic\nBasic-CallCab\nAdvanced-CallCab\n%\nof\nR\ned\nuc\ned\nW\nai\ntin\ng nT\nim\ne\n\(%\n 5\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nA\nct\nua\nlD\net\nou\nr\nR\nat\nio\n\(%\n Detour Ratio VS. Dataset\nE. Percentage of Reduced Waiting Time\nIn this subsection, we show the percentage of reduced\nwaiting time due to carpooling in Figure 17. Because the\nmethod we use to calculate waiting time is based on taxicabs\npassing locations of pickup events, we present the percentage\nof reduced waiting time from hours 8 to 20 of a weekday,\ndue to the high densities of taxicabs and pickup events. Dur-\ning rush hours e.g., from 8 to 10 A.M., all systems with\ncarpool services reduce the waiting time by as much as 63%\non average. Heuristic outperforms the rest because it recom-\nmends the closest occupied taxicab for carpooling service,\nand other systems perform similarly to each other. In short,\ncarpooling services can signi?cantly reduce passenger’s\nwaiting time, when regular taxicab services are not suf?cient.\nF. Impact of Insuf?cient Datasets\nIn this subsection, we evaluate CallCab when there is no\nsuf?cient dataset for analysis. Figure 18 shows the perfor-\nmance of CallCab in terms of detour ratio in one rush hour\n8AM to 9AM of a weekday with the maximum recommen-\ndation radius, when one to ?ve days of dataset are used for\nanalysis. We observe that even though with only a dataset of\none day, CallCab still achieves satisfactory performance,\ne.g., Advanced and Basic achieves a 16% and 28% detour\nratio, respectively. When more datasets are available, the\nperformance of both versions of CallCab becomes better.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we analyze, design, and evaluate a recom-\nmendation system CallCab for both carpooling and regular\ntaxicab services in large-scale taxicab networks. CallCab\ndata mines taxicab trip distributions from historical GPS\ndatasets collected in an existing infrastructure, and recom-\nmends either a vacant taxicab with no detour distance or a\ncarpool route with a small detour distance. We employ a\ngeneric MapReduceMeasure model to ef?ciently tackle the\nraw GPS dataset to obtain recommended taxicabs. We verify\nCallCab with a real world dataset of 14, 000 taxicabs, and\nresults show that compared to ground truth, CallCab can\nsave the passenger’s initial wait time and fare, by decreasing\nboth 64% of the total mileage and 63% of the passenger’s\nwaiting time, leading to a faster and affordable service.\nIX.

3. The set of possible\narchitectures is given by the Cartesian product of the ranges\nof values in Table 3 which consists of 3,636 architectures.\n11\nFigure 11. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3b: Prepare explanations\nStakeholder requirements\nFive stakeholder groups or panels were identified for this\nexample, labeled as follows: weather climate, ecosystems,\nwater, and applications. All five panels were initially con-\nsidered equally important; a case with non-uniform weights\nis considered later in the sensitivity analysis. Note that the\npanels’ relative weights could be obtained through a formal\nmethod such as the one proposed by Cameron et al [32].\nThe specific objectives of each panel, as well as their relative\nranking, are provided in Appendix B.\nCapability rules\nNominal instrument capabilities are presented in Appendix\nA. However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters. Below are\na few examples of situations in which data quality is severely\ncompromised due to orbital parameters.\nLighting conditions—Visible and NIR instruments \(namely\nthe corresponding channels of the IR radiometer node because they cannot gather\nenough light.\nImage distortion—Side-looking instruments cannot work at\nlow altitudes because image distortion becomes unaccept-\nable.\nEmergence rules\nEmergent behavior plays a key role in value delivery to\nstakeholders. We describe in this subsection a few examples\nof emergent behavior \(both in science and cost spatial\nresolution soil moisture dataset provided by LRADIO can be\ncombined with the lower accuracy, higher spatial resolution\ndataset provided by LSAR to produce a new high accuracy,\nmedium spatial resolution dataset.\nSample averaging—In any dataset, part of the non-systematic\nerror can be reduced by averaging samples in time or space,\nthus effectively creating a new dataset that trades accuracy\nagainst spatial or temporal resolution.\nLevel-4 data products—A level-4 net carbon ecosystem ex-\nchange dataset can be created from the combination of a\nlevel-3 soil moisture dataset and several ancillary products,\nnamely land surface temperature, vegetation state, and land-\ncover status.\nMultispectral measurements—IR and MW snow and ice cover\ndatasets can be combined to produce new, multispectral, more\naccurate datasets.\nSharing a common dish—The L-band radar and radiometer\ncan share a common antenna thus effectively reducing the\ntotal mass of the system.\nLearning Curve—If several identical satellites are developed\nand fabricated, the marginal cost of the second and subse-\nquent units is lower than the cost of the first unit due to\nlearning.\nResults\nThe set of 3,636 architectures was evaluated using VASSAR.\nThe benefit portion is based on the set of requirements from\nAppendix B. The cost portion is based on the cost model de-\nscribed in Appendix C. The point science scores and lifecycle\ncost estimates for all these architectures are shown on Figure\n12. These numbers are obtained from defuzzyfying the fuzzy\n12\nFigure 12. Expected science vs expected lifecycle cost for\n3,636 architectures \(uniform weights analysis—The main goal of any system architect-\ning tool is to gain insight into the “shape” of the tradespace,\nwhat the main trades are, whether there are families of\narchitectures, and so on. We observe several features just by\nlooking at the tradespace in Figure 12:\n\(1 a science score\nof 0. This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate. An example of the latter is when a side-\nlooking instrument is put at 400km, resulting in a too large\nimage distortion.\n\(2 unresolvable conflicting require-\nments. In this particular case, most of the observations\nrequire a SSO in order to get rid of diurnal variations in radi-\nance. However, a small subset of requirements that concern\noceanography or cryospheric measurements are ideally taken\nin true polar, non-SSO orbits, in order to avoid tidal aliasing\n\(oceanography cryosphere it is impossible to be in a polar\nand SSO orbit simultaneously, some value is going to be lost\nno matter what decision is made.\n\(3 costs. This is a typical behavior in\narchitectural tradespaces, that has its origins in the non-linear\nmapping between capabilities and satisfaction, namely in the\nquantization of satisfaction levels. In other words slightly\ndifferent performances may be perceived as equivalent in\nterms of satisfaction by stakeholders.\nExplanation facility—The explanation facility provides sup-\nport for more advanced analysis of the tradespace. Examples\nof the features of the explanation facility are listed below:\n\(1 The explanation facility provides\ndetailed explanations of the scores of an architecture in text\nformat as required by the user. An example of such informa-\ntion is provided in Table 4.\n\(2 support: The explanation facility\ncan provide information about one or more architectures on\nFigure 13 


Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy results—We emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., “Most” or “Some larger.\nSensitivity Analysis—There are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis. The red line shows the\ncorrespondence between scalar mass and scalar cost through\na parametric relationship embedded in the tool.\n3 merit change\nwhen each variable is changed. Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17. This kind of results can be useful to determine the\noptimal evolution of an architecture, such as in determining\nan optimal descoping option in the event of a downward\nbudget.\n15\nTable 6.

Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSAR’s\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability.

I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
