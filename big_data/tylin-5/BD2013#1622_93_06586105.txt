A Novel Clutter Suppression Algorithm with Kalman \nFiltering \nHe Yan, Robert Wang, Canguan Gao, Yunkai Deng and Mingjie Zheng \nSpace Microwave Remote Sensing System Department \nInstitute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences  \nBeijing, China \n123hexiaojiutian@163.com \n \nAbstract—Reduced-dimension space-time adaptive nprocessing \(STAP nsuppress ground clutter. However, their performance \noften degrades in nonhomogeneous environments due to nthe inaccurate estimation of the interference covariance \nmatrix from the secondary data. In this paper combing \nwith Kalman filtering, we propose a novel algorithm to \nsuppress ground clutter based on the data model of radar \nechoes from multichannel wide-area surveillance systems. \nSince the proposed algorithm does not need to estimate \nthe interference covariance matrix, it has a big advantage \nwhen processing the data from nonhomogeneous \nenvironments. The effectiveness of the proposed \nalgorithm is validated by the simulated data from PAMIR \nsystem. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nMultichannel airborne radar systems often have two modes \nof GMTI synthetic aperture radar based GMTI \(SAR-GMTI WAS-GMTI designed to detect moving targets in strip-map SAR mode, \ntherefore, one moving target is observable in only one \nsynthetic aperture time and the available surveillance area is \nsmall. Via antenna scanning in the azimuth direction, WAS-\nGMTI mode can greatly enlarge the observation area. It can \nalso increase the detection probability of moving targets and \nmakes the tracking of the detected objects possible. Due to nthese features, WAS-GMTI mode has many civilian and \nmilitary applications, such as traffic monitoring and battlefield \nsurveillance [1-3]. \nThe core step of the multichannel WAS-GMTI signal \nprocessing is to suppress the ground clutter. Clutter \nsuppression can be realized via along-track interferometry \n\(ATI phase centre antenna \(DPCA STAP  to two-channel system. If they are used in \nmultichannel system, the acquired data may not be used nsufficiently, and thus the clutter suppression ability is limited. \nConventional STAP techniques can significantly improve the \nminimum detectable velocity \(MDV system in the presence of strong \nclutter, and reduced-dimension STAP techniques have been \ndeveloped to reduce the computational load and the needed \namount of secondary data [3]. However, in a nonhomogeneous nenvironment, the performance of STAP techniques will be \naffected due to the inaccurately estimated interference \ncovariance matrix. \nIn this paper, after analyzing the data model of radar \nechoes in multichannel WAS-GMTI system, a novel \nalgorithm is proposed to suppress ground clutter based on \nKalman filtering. The proposed algorithm is applied to each \ncell in the range-Doppler domain. Besides, the data from each \nchannel are regarded as one measurement of the scene in the \nprocess of the Kalman filtering. Via reasonably setting the \nstate update equation and measurement equation, moving \ntargets can be gradually separated from ground clutter in the \nprocess of recursive calculation. Since the proposed algorithm \nhas no requirements of estimating the interference covariance \nmatrix, it may have a better performance in nonhomogeneous \nenvironments compared with STAP techniques.  \nII. GEOMETRY AND DATA MODEL \nThe geometry of multichannel WAS-GMTI mode is \nshown in Fig.1. A single-input multiple-output \(SIMO radar system with K  receiving channels is \nplaced on the platform. And the platform flies along the \nazimuth direction \(Y-axis nchannel, and \( 1,2 Hence, 1 0d = . \nThe WAS-GMTI data are processed per scan and per \nantenna look direction separately [1, 2 After I/Q balancing, \nwe perform range compression and range migration \ncorrection, and then use azimuth compression phase to \nachieve azimuth de-chirp [4]. Thus, the data are transformed \nto the range-Doppler domain for further processing. Suppose \nthat one clutter scatterer from azimuth angle of c?  and one \nmoving target from azimuth angle of  t?  falls into the same \n \n2013 IEEE Radar Conference \(RadarCon13 n978-1-4673-5794-4/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE\nDoppler cell \(the n th Doppler cell the m th \nrange cell see Fig.1 m th \nrange cell of the k th channel can be written as \n     cos  exp\( cos  n+ × ? +\n\(1   cos component  cos     among all channels cos and 2exp\( cos among all channels moving target component respectively, \nand ?  is the wavelength of the radar. \n \nFigure 1 Geometry of WAS-GMTI mode. \n \nIn WAS-GMTI mode, the Doppler frequency of the n th \nDoppler cell and the corresponding azimuth angle

CLUTTER SUPPRESSION WITH KALMAN FILTERING \nIn this Section, we apply Kalman filtering to suppress the \nground clutter based on the data model mentioned in Section \nII. After compensating the phase differences of the clutter \ncomponent along all channels, the clutter component and \nmoving target component of the 1k + th channel about the \nn th Doppler cell and the m th range cell can be written as \n1   5  cos     6  n m?  and nmoving target component respectively, 1_k kd +  denotes the \ndistance between the k th and 1k + th channel and can be \nexpressed by \n1_ 1k k k kd d d+ += ?   \(7 targets \nare unknown beforehand, therefore we use the antenna look \ndirection s?  to replace t?  and ascribe the difference to \n 6  cos    n\nk k k s\nk k\nd f\nTc n m j d j\nV\nTc n m n m\n?? ??\n?\n+\n+ += ? ×\n× +\n\(8 data model of the \n1k + th channel about the n th Doppler cell and the m th \nrange cell can be expressed by \n1 1 1 1    9 analysis, we construct the \nstate update equation and measurement equation of the \nmultichannel WAS-GMTI system.

We apply Kalman \nfiltering steps shown in Table 1 to every cell in the range-\nDoppler domain, and the moving target component and \nclutter component can gradually be separated in the process \nof recursion. \nNote that Kalman filtering used in our algorithm is \ndifferent from its conventional uses in other applications. \nKalman filtering is usually used to separate the signal ncomponent from the noise component, and it may take tens of \nor even hundred of recursions to reach its convergence where \nthe signal component can be successfully extracted. However, \nin our application, what we need is to separate the moving \ntarget component from the clutter component rather than to \nseparate these two components from the noise component, \nthus, Kalman filtering has no need to reach its convergence. \nSimulation results show that the moving target component is \ngradually extracted after the second recursions. Since the data \nfrom each channel are regarded as one measurement of the \nscene, thus the proposed algorithm can be used in wide-area \nsurveillance system with two channels or more depending on \nthe GMTI performances of the system such as minimum \ndetectable velocity \(MDV FOR MULTICHANNEL WAS-GMTI SYSTEM \nKalman Filtering Time Update Equations \nthe a priori estimates of the state variables at the 1k + th channel \n1\n1\n     n=? ? ? ?? ?? ?\nA\n\n  \nthe a priori estimate error covariance at the 1k + th channel \nH\n1

DISASTER ANALYSIS\nPlat size is the most fundamental Fast-Earth parameter It\ninfluences usability, total number of plats managed by the\nserver, image data size, downlink time, mobile user interface,\nand other performance attributes. This section summarizes\nmulti-variate analysis supporting plat size selection.\nRepresentative Disasters\nWe selected a representative set of disasters: 2010 San Bruno\nexplosion [39], 2006 Mid-Atlantic states flood [40], 2005\nHurricane Katrina [41], 2006 Graniteville South Carolina\nchemical spill [42], 2001 9/11 New York terrorist attack\n[43], and 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake 44]. We use only\nUnited States disasters for numerical analysis because of\ncommon standard-of-living and response structures, but also\nresearched the 2010 Haiti earthquake [2]. These disasters\nloosely cluster into two groups: 1 and chemical spills are man-made disasters.\nBasic Disaster Variables\nWe reviewed each disaster in terms of six variables: crisis\ntype, affected area, number of responders, financial loss,\npeople affected, and deaths Table 2 summarizes variable\nestimates. Fig. 2 plots two variables, area vs responders,\nshowing clusters for natural and man-made disasters. It\nshows, for example, the massive impact of Hurricane Katrina.\n1\t n10\t n100\t n1000\t n10000\t n100000\t n0.01\t 0.1\t 1\t 10\t 100\t 1000\t 10000\t 100000\t 1000000\t nDisaster\t Area\t vs\t Emergency\t Responders\t nEm\ner\nge\nnc\ny \nR\nes\npo\nnd\ner\ns \n\(e\nst\n km^2 nGraniteville \nChemical Spill \nLoma Prieta \nEarthquake \nHurricane \nKatrina \nMid-Atlantic \nFlood \nMan-Made nFocused Area \nDisasters \nNatural \nLarge Area \nDisasters \nFigure 2. Areas and responders for six disasters\nCrisis type, C, is a categorical crisis variable that helps char-\nacterize first responder activities. As described by Litman\n“Every disaster presents a unique combination of problems.\nKatrina, which hit the Gulf Coast August 29, 2005, began\nwith a hurricane, which lead to infrastructure damage, flood-\ning civil disorder, fires, toxic chemical dispersion, disease\nrisk, and thousands of people isolated for days without water,\nfood or medical care. Rita, which hit the Coast September\n24, 2005, created huge traffic congestion and fuel supply\nproblems [45] .” At the server, C relates to mobile access\npatterns and required information in data stores.\nAffected Area, A, in km2, is a real number that relates to\nplat size required by responders. It is easily estimated for\nman-made disasters but difficult for natural disasters. At the\n3\nTable 2.

Civilization values food water, shelter, security, and\nquality of life. Responders supplement lost infrastructure.

related to crisis scope in\nterms of the most valuable thing to society: human life. It is\nproportional to responder hazards. At the server, D relates to\nan increased need for timely data for life-saving activities.\nTime duration of crisis, T , in hours, is an important variable\nnot easily estimated, and not initially considered by our\nresearch.

ARCHITECTURE: PLAT DESIGN\nTwo critical design activities are Plat Size, and Plat Locations.\nPlat Size Design\nUtility—Fig. 4 heuristically represents mission utility in terms\nof three parameters along a common x-axis representing\nplat area. The top plot shows that if the plat area is too\nsmall, users lack spatial context, but as area increases, utility\nincreases up to a point. The middle plot shows that download\ntimes increase with more area, reducing timeliness. The\nbottom plot shows a sweet spot balanced between spatial and\ntemporal needs.\nPlat ID Word Size—According to WGS-84, the earth has a\nsurface area of ER = 510, 065, 621.724 km2.

Our simple converter, implemented in\nC , performs over 6 million conversions per second.\n5 ARCHITECTURE: ALGORITHM DESIGN\nThe prototype Fast-Earth server software architecture shown\nin Fig. 8 is implemented on a portable Apple Mac Mini\nwith Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB of memory, 1 TB of internal\nstorage, and a series of external USB hard drives. We built our\nserver using custom scripts and open source tools including\nPython, GDAL \(Geospatial Data Abstraction Library  flow is predominantly left to right towards the\nuser as shown in the top bar of Fig. 8. Remote sensing data is\ncollected by aerial and satellite sensors, processed, and placed\nin a traditional data center on the left In the middle, Fast-\nEarth provides plat caches. On the right, web interfaces tie to\ncommunication links. On the far right, mobile wireless user\napplications and other applications in the command centers\nsubmit queries to the server.\nData center\nThe Fast-Earth data center has hidden architectural elegance\nthat is not apparent until performance is compared with tile\nservers as described by Sample [15] or other high perfor-\nmance remote-sensing server architectures.\nEmergency response is a race against time where low-RPM\nhigh-capacity portable drives may outperform high perfor-\nmance disk racks in speed due mostly to size. Insight comes\nfrom mobile supercomputing researchers [49] [50] [51] mon-\nitoring shifts in computing power from supercomputers to\nmobile phones. A mirror situation is the shift in storage\ncapacity to small portable consumer drives.\nThe data center on the left of Fig. 8, is a column of stores:\na series of 2TB external USB drives containing thousands\nof 300MB GeoTiff images in arbitrary hierarchies. Ex-\nperimental data included 6TB of National Guard disaster\nresponse aerial survey data at 6 inch and 1 foot resolution,\n8GB of USGS internet aerial and satellite surveys, and Haiti\ndisaster data.

The challenge is insuffi-\ncient time to import data into structured databases: Import\nand processing of terabytes of files takes hours or days.\nA portable drive can fly on plane, store real-time orthorec-\ntified sensor data [52] [53 54], be removed, and plugged\ninto a server, with data instantly available, but a large rack\ncannot. In essence, Fast-Earth sprints remote sensing data\ncontained on small portable drives to front line responders\nand wins against large servers optimized for office map\nanalysis marathons.\nThe design derives from our disaster analysis: it is uncommon\nto have neatly organized central data stores with diverse data.\nInstead as with Hurricane Katrina, aerial survey teams, local\ngovernments, federal and commercial satellite operators and\nsensor researchers [2], all contribute data. Throughout the\ncrisis, data arrives at command centers by internet, bundles\nof hard drives, or suitcases of DVDs. The most certain of\nall design assumptions is that data arrives in a host of file\nformats and directory hierarchies with poorly-documented\nnaming conventions due to collection urgency.\nTraditional servers use highly specialized data bases, file\nstructures, and disk racks Once data is in the system and\nprocessed and structured appropriately, there is no peer for\nrapid delivery But, to the extent that servers require time-\nconsuming import/copy/processing prior to dissemination,\nthe server itself becomes the barrier.\nFast-Earth meets the mission need, once a new drive is\nattached to the server, by scanning for imagery, using a\ntree algorithm assuming arbitrary directory hierarchies then\nupdating the rapid index. Data can then immediately be\naccessed by phones.\nData center interfaces\nData center interfaces consist of five components: file system,\nGDAL meta-data drivers, a rapid index, and access and\nsearch interfaces. Images are stored in the disk drive file\nsystem instead of a database. GDAL provides the ability to\nread image files. The Access and Search Interface provides\nalgorithms that use the tables to look up a series of available\nimagery given a geographical coordinate of interest. Other\ncomponents are described in more detail below.\nMeta-data drivers are heuristic algorithms that access file\nmetadata in GeoTiff tags. We noticed that time-tag metadata\nnames varied by survey team, and probably require software\nstandardization. Correct time tags are important for first\nresponders. For example, consider a responder conducting\na neighborhood evacuation given two plat images at different\ntimes, one with a car and people, and the other without. Time\norder enables the responder to determine whether people have\npreviously evacuated, or new people have entered the danger\nzone and may require warning.\nThis algorithm creates indexes from arbitrary disk stores\nto allow search by location.. The Rapid Index is for the\nimages in the stores, not the plats in the cache. Rapid Ingest\nuses a recursive algorithm to scan across all disk stores and\ndirectories. Our initial implementation created a two level\nindex: a master index and a series of sub indexes, one for each\ndirectory on the disk. Preliminary measurements showed an\nindexing rate of 10 minutes per terabyte.\nSubsequently we researched and experimented with an im-\n6\nFast Earth  \nCoordinate System nConverters \nW\neb\n H\nTT\nP \n S\ner\nvi\nce\ns \nR00 R01 R100 \n. . . \nImage Chipper \nCache Repositories : Data Metadata \nFast Responder \nWireless \nMobile App \nAccess & \nSearch \nInterface \nManaging System Control Logic nImage \nData \nPlat \nAccess \nServices \nFi\nle\n S\nys\nte\nm\n  S\ner\nvi\nce\ns \nCache Ingest \n“Datacenter” \nImage \nData nImage \nData \nSensors Datacenter Fast-Earth Comms Mobile  User \nHard Problem: \n“The last 400 feet” \nGDAL nRapid \nIndex \nMeta-data \nDrivers \nCache Access \nUser \nAuthentication \nInterface Fast Earth Server “Cache Datacenter” \nFast Responder \nWired Network \n“App” \nInterface \nImage \nData Rapid Ingest \nFigure 8.

This is the most innovative and\ncritical algorithm in the system, based on reverse asymmetric\nparallel processing concepts.\nTraditional remote sensing servers store data by collection\nrecord. When a request is received for a geographic location,\na database searches all records to find matches. The time-\nliness challenge is that response time is proportional to the\nproduct of records and simultaneous users. The traditional\nsolutions apply faster servers, disks, and parallel processors.\nWith mobile computing, challenges are amplified. The\nmobile-server relationship is asymmetric [28 in that whereas\nmost client-server algorithms assume a desktop client with\nwall power, mobile phones have small batteries. Servers must\nconserve client power by offloading computations [57].\nFast-Earth uses a non-intuitive high-performance approach:\nparallel search on client phones. This is an impossible\noperation 


with traditional servers because only the servers\ncan track the growing number of records in the database,\nso clients wait while they search. However, with Fast-Earth\nbecause the earth and plats are fixed in size, the total number\nof plat caches is fixed. Thus simple algorithms convert a\nlatitude,longitude pair to a plat ID and run efficiently on\nphones. In reverse asymmetry, “searches” are performed on\nclient phones in parallel each contacting the server directly\nwith the record ID, increasing service speed.\nThus the approach and motivation behind Section 3 is to se-\nlect plat size, to fix total number of records, to enable creation\nof efficient search algorithms, to offload computations to the\nphones in parallel, to increase responsiveness of the server, to\nincrease timely data dissemination to mobile users.\nThe Image Chipper, given a plat ID searches for images\nwithin the plat cache, chips out plat pages, and converts them\nto JPEG using ImageMagick 58].\nThe Cache Repositories hold the global cache. A large\nserver would have thousands of repositories distributed across\nnumerous disks. We simulated 100 repositories, each respon-\nsible for 30 million plats.\nWeb Services and Applications\nFig. 8 shows web services on the right. The web server\naccepts HTTP requests using a session-less interface. We es-\ntimate our prototype could support 100+ simultaneous users.\nApplications shown in Fig. 8 include both the Fast-Responder\nwireless mobile app for iPhone [1], and the Fast-Responder\nnetwork app as a command center desktop widget.\n6. PERFORMANCE RESULTS\nWe tested the prototype server using up to three iPhones\nand an iPad tablet simultaneously with a mobile hot spot.\nNational Guard volunteers experimented with the apps and\nprovided feedback. One case of interest was the capability to\nuse the iPhone 4S to access Fast-Earth and wirelessly transmit\nthe interactive display to a battery-operated micro-projector\nprojecting a small screen on the wall.\nUsing a 3G wireless link with an iPhone 4 or 4S, it is possible\nto select and download a handful of images at a plat within\nseconds. The process of starting the app, using GPS to select\na location, chipping and transmitting an index from the server,\nselecting images for download, and flickering between two or\nmore images, can be accomplished in less than a minute.\nAs an anecdote, after weeks of Fast-Responder experimenta-\ntion by many people, testing in numerous locations, viewing\nwhat we considered large amounts of data, we were surprised\nto discover the cache contained only about 80 MB of imagery,\na small fraction of our terabytes of data.\nWhile this may not be representative of a real disaster sce-\nnario it reminds us of experiments in human vision and gaze\n7\ncontrol [59]. It is well known in human vision studies that\nthe human visual cognitive system, in assessing a new scene,\ndoes not spend an equal amount of time on every pixel.\nInstead, the eye rapidly focuses attention on key parts of a\nscene. It seems possible that in real use the number of plats\naccessed may be much smaller than expected.\nTraditional remote sensor assumptions may be flawed in how\ndata is packaged and delivered. Image data compression is\nused on the assumption that all parts of a large image are\nequally valuable because there is no simple way to determine\nwhich parts are actually used. Because Fast-Earth provides\nfocus, data volumes may be dramatically reduced.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nThe Fast-Earth prototype feasibly answers the call to incorpo-\nrate more remote sensing into emergency management 21]\nby using earth quantization to rapidly disseminate data to\nemergency responder smartphones [1]. This architecture can\naugment existing servers during a disaster.\nThe challenge of getting data to mobile responders requires\ntransformative ideas and technologies from the research com-\nmunity. One transformative vision comes from Basole [60]\nwho conceived a framework for enterprise mobilization and\ntransformation. His process starts with a mobile adoption\ndecisions and leads through a series of stages to new core\ncompetencies These ideas may suggest ways to create other\nnew emergency response competencies that benefit victims,\nresponders, and decision-makers alike.\nIdeas for future Fast-Earth research include the following.\nImage Registration—Proper registration is a continuing crit-\nical need in disaster response [24 Automatic registration\nalgorithms [61] employed prior to chipping may improve user\nsituation awareness User-submitted ground control points\nmay also help. If a responder flickers through a series of\nimages, and some are mis-registered, it may be confusing.\nImage Processing—Image processing techniques can be used\nto create a many data layers on the fly for each plat. These\nlayers could focus attention on key scene features such as\nman-made regions \(MMR RBL  unique uses\nfor image processing products.\nMulti-sensor Fusion— Many opportunities exist for sensor\nfusion in disaster response [62]. For example, after an\nearthquake, besides structural damage and rubble, the next\nmost significant danger is fire [63]. Many remote sensing\ntechniques have been developed for global fire monitoring\nas part of climate analysis [64] [65] [66]. These techniques\ncould be adapted to automated processing and fused with\nrubble information to assist earthquake responders.\nTime Trending—Because Fast-Earth accumulates time-series\nsensor data in plat caches, adaptations of existing algorithms\n[67] could automatically create trend products. Some respon-\nders may lack time to flicker through a series of images but\nvalue a single picture of trended nearby hazardous activity.\nData Compression—Fast-Earth is a data 


compression method\nthat clips out image parts not of primary interest. Traditional\ndata compression variations could be explored in a responder\ncontext. For example, some man-made disasters such as\nchemical spills are hazardous to responders but may not\nbe detectable from simple imagery. Hyperspectral sensors\ncould potentially warn responders, but have data volumes\ntoo high for transmission to a phone. Years of research has\nbeen devoted to hyperspectral data compression [68] but data\nvolumes are still too high for mobile computing.\nIn summary, earth quantization provides a novel way to\npartition the earth and opens a new horizon for rapid wide\nscale dissemination of large amounts of remote sensing data\nat near real-time rates. The Fast-Earth geospatially-organized\ncache and server based on the earth quantization concept has\npotential to transform future remote sensing dissemination\nand image processing capabilities.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
