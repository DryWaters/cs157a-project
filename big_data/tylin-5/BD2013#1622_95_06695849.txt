Significant results have been achieved \nto interface with the brain directly and the current research is very promising.  Another approach to gain in-\nformation from the nervous system is to tap into the input to and output from the brain: the peripheral nerv-\nous system \(PNS this presentation, I \nwill review some of the various approaches, challenges and solutions to interfacing with the PNS. \n \nBiographical Sketch:  Dominique M.

nPRESENTATION TITLE: Deep Brain Stimulation – Challenges and Opportunities \n \nAbstract: Deep brain stimulation has revolutionized treatment for patients with ad-\nvanced Parkinson’s disease \(PD disorders with patients experi-\nencing marked improvement in motor signs while significantly reducing medication. \nAs a result of this success new DBS applications are growing at a pace that far exceeds \nearly expectations. DBS is now at various stages of exploration for a multitude of neu-\nrological and psychiatric disorders. And although thousands of manuscripts have been written regarding its \ntherapeutic effect for patients with PD and other “circuit” disorders, there remains no standard approach \nfor implantation, its mechanism of action remains unclear and we continue to use the same technology that \nwas used in the 1980’s To say that technology has not evolved nearly as rapidly as the development of new \napplications for DBS would be an understatement. We have a once size fits all brain targets lead and while \nsome progress has been made in programming tools and current generators we have limited capabilities in \nprogramming strategies. Current steering, 3-D lead technology, remote programming capabilities and \ngreater flexibility in methods of delivering current pulses and introducing new patterns of stimulation re-\nmain on the workbench or as ideas that have not yet made their way into practice. Closed-loop feedback \napproaches are only now undergoing more in depth study using a current generator available in limited \nnumbers to a limited number of centers. The potential for this field is tremendous, from both a clinical and \ntechnological perspective; realization of this potential, however will depend on our ability to address these \ntechnological and methodological deficiencies. \n \nBiographical Sketch:  Jerrold L.

Berger \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Engineering Memories: A Cognitive Neural  \nProsthesis for Restoring and Enhancing Memory Function \n \nAbstract Dr Berger leads a multi-disciplinary collaboration with Drs. Marmarelis, \nSong, Granacki, Heck, and Liu at the University of Southern California, Dr. Cheung at \nCity University of Hong Kong, Drs. Hampson and Deadwyler at Wake Forest University, and Dr. Gerhardt \nat the University of Kentucky.  The team is developing a microchip-based neural prosthesis for the hippo-\ncampus, a region of the brain responsible for long-term memory formation.  A proof-of-concept is presented \nusing rats chronically implanted with stimulation/recording micro-electrodes throughout the hippocam-\npus, and that have been trained in a delayed non-match-to-sample task.  Memory-behavioral function of \nthe hippocampus is blocked pharmacologically, and then in the presence of that blockade, hippocampal \nmemory/behavioral function is restored by a multi-input multi-output model of hippocampal nonlinear \ndynamics that interacts bi-directionally with the in vivo hippocampus.  These results show for the first \ntime that it is possible to create “hybrid electronic-biological” systems that mimic physiological properties, \nand thus, may be used as neural prostheses to restore damaged brain regions. \n \nBiographical Sketch:  Theodore W. Berger is the David Packard Professor of Engineering, Professor of Bio-\nmedical Engineering and Neuroscience, and Director of the Center for Neural Engineering at the University \nof Southern California.  Dr. Berger’s research uses an integrated experimental and theoretical approach to \ndeveloping biologically realistic nonlinear dynamic models of the hippocampus and its function in forming \nnew memories.  The resulting models have been used to understand the role of neural nonlinear dynamics \nin multi-input, multi-output signal processing, the dynamics of large-scale multi-neuron systems, and \nmulti-scale, hierarchical neural organization.  Preclinical applications of Dr Berger’s research include the \ndevelopment of cognitive neural prostheses for restoring lost memory function clinical applications extend \nto the development of medical devices and procedures for controlling seizures industrial applications in-\nclude biologically-based models underlying spatio-temporal pattern recognition Dr. Berger received his \nPhD from Harvard University, and has been elected a Fellow of the AAAS, the AIMBE and the IEEE.  \nAmong other awards, he has recently received the Academic Career Achievement Award from the EMBS. \n \n \nGert Cauwenberghs \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Brain Dynamics of Human Motor Control:  \nNeuromorphic Modeling and Brain-Machine-Body Interfaces \n \nAbstract:  The convergence of neurotechnology and adaptive machine intelligence \nonto low-power silicon integrated systems offers opportunities to drive developments \nin mobile brain-machine-body interfaces for studying brain dynamics of human motor \ncontrol, and for active remediation of motor-related neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

A radi-\ncally new and more immediately applicable 


approach may instead capitalize on the capac-\nity of neuronal circuits within the spinal cord to generate effective postural and locomotor \ntasks. To exploit this potential, however, the spinal circuitry must be reactivated and remodeled in the context \nof the post-injury neurophysiological state of the spinal cord Here, I will introduce neuroprosthetic technolo-\ngies combining intrathecal drug delivery, spinal electrode arrays and closed-loop control systems that are capa-\nble of reactivating spinal locomotor networks after a spinal cord injury. I will show the ability of multisite \nstimulation patterns to control locomotor foot trajectory of otherwise paralyzed rats in real-time and with a re-\nmarkable degree of precision. In combination with robot-assisted training, this electrochemical spinal neuro-\nprosthesis restored supraspinal control over a range of leg movements in rats with a spinal cord injury leading to \ncomplete and permanent paralysis. We found that the recovery relied on the extensive and ubiquitous remodel-\ning of neuronal pathways. Training encouraged the brain to elaborate de novo intraspinal detour circuits that \nrelayed the supraspinal command to spinal locomotor circuits. These findings may inspire new thinking for the \ndesign of strategies to return motor function after spinal cord injury and other neuromotor disorders in humans. \n nBiographical Sketch:  Grégoire Courtine was trained in Mathematics and Physics, but received his PhD in nExperimental Medicine from the Inserm Plasticity and Repair, France, in 2003.

Yet the \napplication of medical technology to address these needs is often limited due to the \nlack of underlying neural data on natural pathophysiology, and in particular, its response to existing and \npotential treatments. This work describes the inherent constraints of medical device design in the evolving \nneurotechnology space, and proposes strategies that might help to overcome these limitations. We propose \nan approach of “biodiscovery,” which embodies the development and deployment of systems that allow si-\nmultaneous scientific investigation and therapeutic delivery. We illustrate our methodology with examples nfrom both translated products and research tools being applied today. \n \nBiographical Sketch:  Tim Denison is a Technical Fellow at Medtronic and Director of Core Technology in \nthe Neuromodulation division, where he helps oversee the design of next generation neural interface and \nalgorithm technologies for the treatment of chronic neurologic disease.

Reggie Edgerton \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Neuromodulation of the Spinal Circuitry to  \nRegain Motor Function after Spinal Cord Injury \n \nAbstract: The readout of our brain is movement and the degree to which these move-\nments are controlled are traditionally reviewed as "autonomically, "automatically", or \n"voluntarily". Recent experiments reveal no clear distinction between these categories \nof control of movement. From these same experiments several novel phenomena have emerged which have \nimportant clues as to how complex sensory-motor 


networks are used to control movement. In parallel \nthese experimental results have led to the development of breakthrough interventional strategies that can \nsignificantly enhance motor performance following the onset of severe neuromotor deficits. These strate-\ngies are centered around the concept of automaticity of motor control. The present challenge is 1 can be used to neuromodulate spinal sen-\nsory-motor networks to achieve a higher functional level and 2 concomitantly develop the technologies \nnecessary to fully capitalize on newly evolving neurobiological phenomena associated with neural modula-\ntion. The focus of my lecture will be on the advancements in the technologies needed to take advantage of \nthe new neurobiological principles that have emerged, particularly over the last ten years.  \n \nBiographical Sketch: V. Reggie Edgerton’s laboratory focuses on two main research questions. One ques-\ntion is how do the neural networks in the lumbar spinal cord of mammals, including humans, regain control \nof standing, stepping and voluntary control of fine movements after paralysis, and how can these motor \nfunctions be modified by chronically imposing activity-dependent interventions after spinal cord injury. \n \n \nDario Farina \n  \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Neural Excitation-Driven Musculo-Skeletal  \nModeling for Rehabilitation Technologies \n \nAbstract: Musculo-skeletal modelling driven by neural information allows bridging the \ngap between the neural and the functional analysis of movement. These models indeed \nprovide the prediction of joint moments and muscle forces from information related to \nthe neural muscular activation. The neural activation can be estimated from the surface \nEMG, as the intensity of the signal, or from the synergistic activation of muscles by a reduced set of motor \nprimitives, or directly from the output of the spinal cord circuitries, as spike trains of populations of motor \nneurons. This methodology has been applied to both upper and lower limb tasks. Among these applications, \nwe will describe in detail the full characterization of grasping of non-human primates when considering a \nlarge repertoire of objects of different shapes and sizes. The developed model allowed the estimation of the \nmusculo-tendon lengths of all involved muscle fascicles for the complex set of grasping types. \n \nNeural excitation-driven models can be implemented online with the possibility of integrating them in \nneurorobotics and neurorehabilitation applications. One of these applications is the real-time feedback to \nthe subject/patient of internal variables, estimated by the model, such as the kinematics of muscle fascicles \nor the joint moments. This information may be delivered either visually or through electro-mechanical \nstimulation and can be used for neuromodulation in rehabilitation. Moreover, the models developed can be \nused as part of the control systems for prostheses and exoskeletons or as a method to predict the mechani-\ncal interactions between exoskeletons and humans. The lecture will provide an overview of recent devel-\nopments in excitation-driven musculoskeletal models, together with examples of applications in various \nareas of neurorehabilitation technologies. \n Biographical Sketch: Dario Farina received the M.Sc. degree in electronics engineering from Politecnico di nTorino, Torino, Italy, in 1998, and the PhD degree in automatic control and computer science and in elec-\ntronics and communications engineering from the Ecole Centrale de Nantes, Nantes, France, and Politec-\nnico di Torino in 2001. \n \nFrom 1997 to 2004 he was a researcher at the Laboratory for Neuromuscular System Engineering \(LISiN sponsored by the European Union \nand the European Space Agency.

Tuning of stimulation parameters is \nan ad hoc empirical process, and can result in sub-optimal outcomes. This work dem-\nonstrates the feasibility of recording neural activity - the evoked compound action po-\ntential \(ECAP ngenerated by synchronous activation of neural elements near the electrode, and is recorded from the DBS nelectrode array. First, we demonstrated the feasibility of recording ECAPs by reducing the stimulus artifact nwhich can otherwise mask or distort the physiological signal. Subsequently, we recorded ECAPs during nthalamic DBS in anesthetized cats and conducted computer simulations of the ECAP generated by a popu-\nlation of thalamic neurons. Finally, we conducted first-in-human recordings of ECAPs using the same elec-\ntrode as implanted for stimulation. \n \nBiographical Sketch:  Warren M.

However very few solutions went \nthrough daily use. Indeed, even though FES allows obtaining movements in a simple nway, complex but multi-joint movements are needed and can hardly be designed empirically. Closed loop ncontrol based on modeling and theory, fatigue compensation, muscle synergies and patient interface should \nbe considered but further increase the complexity of the problem. Moreover, FES is frequently combined \nwith other approaches \(drugs, surgery orthotics, robotics more difficult to understand as a whole. Finally technology issues, in particular for implantable or \nportable systems are not yet fully mature and ready for a daily use. Few important issues will be discussed \nthrough examples from state of the art to try to draw the global picture and trends for the future.  \n \nBiographical Sketch:  David Guiraud obtained M.Sc Degree from Ecole Centrale de Paris in 1990 Ph.D in \nbiomedical Eng. in 1993 on the control of neural prosthesis and exoskeleton using artificial neural net-\nworks.

Kuiken \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Update on TMR with Pattern Recognition  \nfor Control of Powered Prostheses \n \nAbstract: Providing adequate control of a powered artificial arm is difficult, especially \nwith high levels of amputation where the need is greatest.  We have developed a new \ntechnique to create a bi-directional neural interface for artificial limbs called ‘targeted nmuscle reinnervation’ \(TMR and transfer them to spare muscle and skin in or near the limb.  The nerves grow into \nthis muscle, and then the surface EMG over this muscle can be used as an additional control signal.  For ex-\nample, if the median nerve reinnervates a small region of surface muscle, then when the amputee thinks \n´close hand´ this muscle will contract and the myoelectric signal can be used to close the powered hand. \nSince physiologically appropriate neural pathways are used, the control is intuitive, thus easier and faster \nfor the amputee.  \n nSimilarly, sensory nerves can be transferred to the residual nerves so that skin of the chest or arm is rein-\nnervated—targeted sensory reinnervation \(TSR nskin, it feels like he or she is being touched in the missing arm or hand.  TSR can provide a pathway for true \nsensory feedback of light touch, graded pressure, sharp/dull, and thermal feedback. Research is presented \nshowing how the skin of residual limbs has been reinnervated by hand afferents and our early attempts to \nprovide closed loop feedback. \n \nTMR control has also been dramatically improved using pattern recognition computer algorithms. They \nhave greatly increased the degrees of freedom that can be intuitively operated.  Data are presented showing \nthe speed and robustness of control. Videos are presented showing patients operating advanced motorized \narm prostheses. \n \nFinally, we are extending this work to develop neural interfaces and new control systems for powered low-\ner limb prostheses. For transfemoral amputees, EMG signals are recorded from the thigh muscle within \ntheir prosthetic sockets.  The EMG information is ‘fused with sensor data from the prosthesis to improve \nthe overall performance of the prosthesis—especially when the user is transitioning to different modes of \nmobility. TMR has been performed in 2 transfemoral amputees This enables the control of more degrees of \nfreedom in the lower leg and may also improve the amputees mobility with the powered prosthesis. \n \nBiographical Sketch:  Todd A. Kuiken received his MD and PhD in biomedical engineering from North-\nwestern \(1990 Chicago \(1995 in the Depts. of PM&R, Bio-\nmedical Engineering and Surgery of Northwestern University.   \n \nDr. Kuiken’s research team is working to develop a neural-machine interface to improve the function of artifi-\ncial limbs A main research focus of the lab is developing a technique to use nerve transfers for improvement \nof myoelectric prosthesis control.  By transferring the residual arm nerves in an upper limb amputee to spare nregions of muscle it is possible to make new signals for the control of robotic arms.  These signals are be di-\nrectly related to the original function of the limb and allow simultaneous control of multiple joints in a natu-\nral way. This work has now been extended with the use of pattern recognition algorithms, enabling the nintuitive control of more functions it the prosthetic limbs. Similarly, hand sensation nerves grow into spare nskin so that when this skin is touched, the amputee feels like their missing hand is being touched. \n \n \n Brian Litt \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  High Resolution Recording and  \nData Mining in Epileptic Networks \n nAbstract: The President's BRAIN initiative ambitiously wants to map the human brain.  \nCentral questions to this effort are what spatial and temporal scales are relevant, what \nkinds of technologies will we need to map

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
