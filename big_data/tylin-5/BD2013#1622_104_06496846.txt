INTRODUCTION \nComplex projects such as NASA missions are plagued by \nperformance ambiguity. An apparently successful outcome \nmay be the result of good planning and management or a \nfortunate draw from the set of stochastic processes that \nimpact mission performance Similarly, a failure may be the \nresult of poor management or an unfortunate draw from \nthese stochastic processes. Even after the outcome of the \nevent is known, cognitive biases often hinder the accuracy \nof one's interpretation for why the event occurred, \ndegrading the ability of organizations to learn from the \nevent For example, self-attribution errors [4] mean \nindividuals are more likely to attribute successes to their nown ability and their failures to luck. \nAlso, Dillon and Tinsley [2] show that people have a \ntendency to categorize near-miss events-situations in \nwhich a bad outcome could have occurred but didn't due to nchance-as successful events rather than almost successes \nor almost failures \(the so-called "near-miss bias catastrophic, but emit \nonly weak signals. Ironically, the challenge is further \nmagnified when these weak signals persist over time. The \naccumulation of near-misses does not aggregate into \nawareness of an issue but rather makes these near-misses \nseem normal. Such recurrence with no obviously bad \noutcome can create the false impression of system safety. \nWhen near-misses are repeatedly observed, the ability to \ninterpret these events as anomalies commonly decreases \nover time because of normalization of deviance [2,3]. Near­\nmiss recognition only increases again if hazards are made \nsalient by the occasional large failure. We are continually \nconfronted in our research with examples of signals that are \nreadily available after the fact that could have pointed to the \npotential mistake, but the organization failed to learn from \nthese signals n2. DISCOUNTING WEAK SIGNALS \nEngineers often talk of the weak signals that come from test \nresults. Examples of such signals would be small deviations \nor variances in test data that are not seen as significant \nenough to warrant stopping, rethinking, or challenging \nassumptions but that contain latent knowledge that is often nignored. Engineers have design and test deadlines to adhere \nto and if the signals are weak, the tendency is to interpret \nthem as noise in order to keep moving and meet the short­\nterm goals of the project. NASA experienced two high \nprofile failures in 1999 when two missions to Mars both \nfailed. One of these, the Mars Climate Orbiter, was lost \nbecause of the failure to use metric units in the coding of a \npiece of the ground software used in trajectory models. On \nthe way to Mars, propulsion maneuvers were periodically \nperformed to remove angular momentum buildup and these \nevents occurred 10 times more often than was expected by \nthe operations navigation team. Despite these corrections, it \nwas never considered that the programming might be 


nsuspect until the satellite was lost attempting to enter orbit \naround Mars [5]. \nIgnoring Unexpected Results nTests and verification studies involve many complicated \nsteps. The process is tightly specified so as to be able to \npinpoint any performance data not within specification, \nhowever, with such complicated procedures numerous \npeople involved, and different components and units from \ndifferent vendors assembled together, it becomes easy to \ndismiss unexpected results as being driven by something \nother than underlying problems, such as the test equipment. \nThe Hubble Space Telescope Mirror is probably the most \nvisible example of unexpected signals being ignored. The \nmirror polishing data showed some abnormal results but the \nlead individual was so sure of his equipment that he refused \nto consider his calibration unit was actually off until it was \ntoo late and the instrument was on orbit. Fortunately, NASA \nwas able to install a corrective lens on the Hubble telescope \nin orbit, and it has been one the most stunning success \nstories in NASA history, but the blemish of launching with \na faulty mirror is remembered. Other missions cannot be \nsaved if faulty development problems are not detected. In \nthe case of the WIRE mission, a test engineer noticed a \nrandom electrical current upon testing a circuit. It was odd \nso he switched off the bench equipment and rebooted. The \nspurious current did not reappear so he ignored it. Later it \nwas found that the circuit only exhibits that behavior after a \nlong period of rest which is just what happened when the \nrocket sat for two months on the launch pad. The current \nreappeared when the spacecraft was fired up on orbit, and \ncaused the premature ejection of the cover of the instrument, \nrapidly depleting the telescope's coolant, leaving it unusable \nfor its original science objective. \n2 \nFailure myopia \nSystematic biases enter organizational learning processes \nbecause organizations can choose to focus only on \napparently successful projects and outcomes and \nmisinterpret the role of luck in producing these successes. \nBiases in the perception of the relative contributions of \nability and luck to producing any outcome translate into \nbiases in the estimation of risk of the situation. In other nwords, the inclination to misattribute successful outcomes to \nability creates an underestimation of the associated risk. \nThus, over time decision makers can believe that their \nsystems are safer than they are and people take more risk. \nThis situation contributed to both the Challenger and \nColumbia disasters. In the case of the Challenger a-rings, \nNASA flew a series of successful missions despite the \nfaulty a-rings, and interpreted the results as indicating that \nthe system had been robust enough to tolerate a-ring burn­\nthrough 6, 7]. Similarly, until the Columbia accident, the \nshuttle always experienced good luck in that a large enough \npiece of foam debris never struck a very highly sensitive \nportion of the orbiter. However, poor decision-making by \nproject managers allowed pieces of foam similar to the one \nthat doomed Columbia to become detached at least thirty \ntimes on previous missions [8]. With no catastrophic \ndamage, the system was believed to be robust enough to \ntolerate the foam debris problem. \nLevinthal and March [9] suggest that this failure myopia" \nis a problematic issue for organizational learning since \norganizations promote successful people to positions of \npower and authority rather than unsuccessful ones. \nHowever, "successful" people may have simply experienced \nbetter luck in prior responsibilities than "unsuccessful" \nones, creating an illusion of invincibility in the minds of the \n"successful." Thus a bias of success may have a significant \nimpact on the ability of individuals and ultimately the \norganization to learn to correctly estimate risk and make nbetter decisions in the future. \nData from NASA's space shuttle mISSIOns through 2010 \nillustrate how these problems can evolve over time. As \nFigure 1 shows, the number of reported in-flight anomalies \n\(near-misses slopes downward from the first shuttle launch \n\(Space Shuttle Columbia nChallenger disaster. After this disaster, reporting spikes \nupward, but then as time goes on the trend again slopes \ndownward, until the 2003 Columbia disaster. The same \nupward spike and then downward slope pattern appears \nfollowing Columbia. The overall downward trend in \nreported in-flight anomalies is undoubtedly due in part, to a \ndecrease in the number of near-misses actually occurring \nduring shuttle flights as shuttle technology matured. \nHowever, it is unlikely that the spikes in reported anomalies \nfollowing Challenger and Columbia reflect an increase in \ntrue near-miss frequency. Rather, this pattern suggests that \nclear failures Challenger, Columbia ndecreases over time so that near-misses are less noticed \nbecause of the follow-on successful outcomes. \n80 n70 \n60 \n50 \n40 \n30 \n20 \n10 \n• \n0 \n• \n?\nI nFigure 1 - In-Flight Anomalies Reported for each Shuttle \nMission through 2010 with Exponential Trendlines nAdded for the Periods before, between, and after the \nChallenger and Columbia Disasters \n3. STUDY OF ISAS nUsing a proprietary data set of JPL's Incident, Surprise, \nAnomaly \(ISA space \nflight missions managed by JPL between 1989 and 2010, we \nexamine some of the factors that affect near-miss reporting. \nJPL procedures dictate that "an Incident, Surprise, Anomaly \n\(ISA written on all post-launch incidents, \nreal or suspected, which indicate an anomaly in hardware, \nsoftware 


sequencing, test/operations procedures, etc." [10]. \nIn other words, ISA reports document deviations from nexpected performance, or in our terminology, identified \nnear-misses. \nThe missions span from 1989 \(Magellan mission to Venus Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer which represent the \npopulation of JPL missions during the sampling frame with \nthe exception of the Mars Observer and Mars Pathfmder \nmissions whose ISAs could not be located on JPL's \ndatabase during our data collection. Because these missions \ndo not differ meaningfully from the other missions in the \nsample on key variables \(mass, cost, complexity examine the 37 missions in the JPL ISA \ndatabase to determine which characteristics of the project \nare most predictive of ISA's reported for that mission. \nWe first used multiple regression analysis to test if ncharacteristics of a JPL project were predictive of the \nnumber of ISA's reported for that mission. The results of \n3 \nthe regression using the 37 mISSIons in the JPL ISA \ndatabase indicated that two predictors explain 50% of the \nvariance in the population \(R2=.50, F\(2.34 predicted ISA reports are mission size \n\(measured by mass in kilograms: p = .54, p<.OOI significance \(operationalized as a count of the \nnumber of articles in major news outlets devoted to a given nmission published within the period of 1 week before \nmission launch to 1 week after mission launch: p = .36 np=.006 LexisNexis, \nlogged to reduce skewness. Thus, larger and more \nsignificant projects had more ISA reports. Size is a proxy \nfor complexity, and we would expect more complex \nmissions to have more ISA reports. Interesting for this \npaper, though, is that more significant projects also have \nmore reported ISAs. As mentioned in the introduction, \nbecause weak signals and near-misses with no obvious signs \nof failure are often overlooked, in this research we are \nlooking for interventions to encourage the recognition of \nnear-miss events and the appropriate recording of \ncorresponding ISAs. Feeling that a project is significant \nshould increase an individual's feelings of accountability, \nwhere accountability refers to the expectation that one may \nbe called upon to provide a satisfactory justification of one's \nactions to others [11]. As explained in Lerner and Tetlock \n[12], "When people are accountable for their behavior to a \nlegitimate, reasonably well-informed audience whose views \nare unknown and who are interested in accuracy, they \nshould consider multiple perspectives on the issue and try to \nanticipate the objections that reasonable others might raise \nto positions that they take." Thus, accountability should also \nmake people more critical in their evaluation of near-miss \noutcomes and that would be consistent with higher reporting \nlevels for ISAs on significant projects. \nFrom the multiple regression analysis, we examined outliers \nin terms of higher than expected or lower than expected \nreporting of ISAs, where outliers are identified as those \nmissions that have residuals greater than two standard \ndeviations. In this data set of 37 missions, only one mission \nis an outlier, and it is the Spitzer Space Telescope launched \nin 2003 which had a higher than expected number of \nreported ISAs by more than three standard deviations. No \nmissions were lower than expected by greater than two \nstandard deviations. \nAfter examining the results of the mUltiple regression \nanalysis, we followed up with the Mission Assurance \nManager for the Spitzer Space Telescope who identified two \nprimary reasons why the project may have had more than \nexpected ISAs. First, \(with hindsight particularly rigorous. The \nMission Assurance Manager would review all test results \nand attend all product review meetings to make sure an ISA \nwas written for all unexpected results, and would closely \ntrack any repeated idiosyncrasies. For each ISA identified, \nthe project team would perform a root cause analysis to nensure that a similar symptom did not re-occur. Second, \ngiven the way we structured our analyses, the size of the \nSpitzer project may have been underestimated because we \ndefined the project as only the spacecraft The team also was \ntracking all anomalies that occurred for the Deep Space \nNetwork \(DSN critical importance of the \nDSN for relaying the telescope data back to Earth. If the \nDSN identified any incidents, the Spitzer team would also \ncapture the incident in an ISA for data accountability. \nWe then examined the same ISA database over time to \nexamine temporal effects on ISA reporting. For this \nanalysis, as our dependent variable, we constructed a count \nof the number of ISAs reported by month for each JPL \nmission Near-Miss Reports Mission Length, which is the number of elapsed \nmonths since a mission's launch \(logged to reduce \nskewness nIn this analysis, we included several factors as control \nvariables. The first control was an indicator variable that \ntook a value of 1 for missions where JPL was the primary \nmission manager and a value of 0 for missions where JPL \nwas only managing a subcomponent of the mission \(for \nseveral missions in the sample, JPL managed 1 or more \nscientific instruments on the spacecraft, but did not manage \nthe overall mission variable accounted for the fact that \nmore near-misses are reported in JPL's ISA reports for \nmissions managed 


by JPL. In this analysis, we accounted \nfor the technical complexity of a mission using three control nvariables: the mass of the spacecraft \(or the portion of the \nspacecraft managed by JPL for missions where JPL was not \nthe primary mission manager or the portion of the mission managed by JPL possibility that more \ntechnologically complex missions generate a greater number \nof near-misses than less complex missions. We also \nincluded a variable to indicate whether or not a spacecraft \nhad already completed its primary mission \(many spacecraft \nin the sample were given extended missions once their \nprimary objectives had been met the monthly number of ISAs reported equation \(GEE npopulation averaged models correct for clustering while \nexploring variation across the population, not within \nindividual clusters. Thus, all reported models are GEE \npopulation averaged negative binomial models n4 \nTable 1 contains the results of the GEE population averaged \nNegative Binomial regression models. Model 1 contains \nonly the control variables, indicating that several controls \nare significant predictors of near-miss reporting. A greater \nnumber of near-misses were reported for missions managed \nby JPL \(as opposed to involving JPL in a smaller role scientific objectives. Additionally, fewer near­\nmisses are reported for missions that cost more per kg of nmass and during months after a spacecraft has completed its \nprimary mISSIon \(although this variable become ninsignificant in later models where Mission Length is \nincluded Negative Binomial \nRegression Models of Near-Miss Reporting \nd JP LM' " urmg ISSlOns \nI Modell I Model 2 I nIndependent Variables \nMission Length \(# -0.62 *** \nmonths, logged 0.03 articles published, \nlogged 0.06 0.06 nSpacecraft Mass 0.22 *** 0.26 *** \n\(metric tons 0.02 0.02 n\($I,OOOs per kg 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.09 \nCompleted Indicator \(0.05 0.06 are in parentheses \nModel 3 \n-0.61 *** \n\(0.03 0.02 0.06 0.02 n\(0.02 0.01 0.06 tests \nModel 2 introduced the first independent variable, Mission \nLength. The coefficient for this variable was negative and \nsignificant, suggesting that fewer near-misses are reported \nas a mission ages, all else being equal. Model 3 introduced \nthe second independent variable, Mission Significance. The \nMission Significance coefficient was positive and \nsignificant. This fmding indicates that more near-misses \nwere reported for highly significant \(i.e., externally visible general decline in ISA reporting over time for a project \ncould be explained by decreasing error rates over the life of \nthe project. For example, Faris and Bryant [16] demonstrate \nthat from 2001 to 2011, JPL projects have been able to \nreduce their command file error rate from about 1 per month \nto about 1 every 4 months per project. We cannot isolate in \nthis data whether the decline in ISA reports over a project is \nfrom less errors occurring or less attention to the errors \(and \nin reality it is probably some of both message from \nFaris and Bryant [16] is the same: project teams need to stay \nvigilant and search for near-misses at all times. Further, \nthere is no engineering explanation for more near-misses \noccurring for significant projects. \n4. EFFORTS AT NASA TO ADDRESS \nORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING \nKnowing that organizational members report fewer near­\nmisses for a project as the project ages and that project \nsignificance increases near-miss reporting rates, can help \norganizations plan actions to counter these problems. Prior \nresearch on biases in decision making [13] show that one of \nthe most effective tools for ameliorating biases is educating nthe decision maker to the potential cognitive traps. Several \norganizational learning activities at NASA Goddard Space \nFlight Center \(GSFC Flight Center \(GSFC  discuss among themselves what they \nlearned from some recent event, usually a project milestone. \nThese are not exclusively dictated by accidents, close calls \nor mishaps, but can closely examine "perceived" successes nalso. This enables the individuals to learn from each other \nand raises the expectation that what happens is for them to \nlearn from. This also provides an opportunity for a group to \nthink closely about the events and to consider alternative \npossible outcomes, and to consider whether successes could \nhave been failures if not for certain fortunate chance events \n[15]. These events continue throughout the development \nlifecycle so that as the project progresses, people remain \nvigilant in their identification of problems. \nSecond, NASA GSFC sets up Knowledge Sharing \nWorkshops regularly across the center where teams can talk \nabout their lessons in 


a panel discussion format with other \nproject teams. Through participation, individuals from other \nteams can feel that all projects are significant and that \nimportant learning opportunities exist from even the \nweakest signals on their own projects. These formats allow \ndirect and interactive sharing of real lessons. It's a learning, \nexploring activity; an investment in the intellectual \ncapability of the workforce that provides the opportunity to \nprovide important messages that can help prevent future \ncatastrophes. This workshop format has also been adopted at \nother NASA centers and as part of the Project Management \nChallenge conference held annually in the spring \n\(http://pmchallenge.gsfc.nasa.gov around particular missions \(both successful and \nchallenged missions studies of projects, events, \nand milestones for use in structured training environments. \nThese case studies are meant to generate discussion and \ndebate. These case studies focus on both successes and \nfailures and provide the opportunity to explore which \nsuccesses might have been near-misses. They are not \n"answers provided to engineers on how to do their job. A \nproject manager, systems engineer, or key team member is noften brought into a training class to discuss what happened, \nwhy they did what they did and what they learned from it. \nThe cases do not have simplistic answers and generally \nrequire hard, ambiguous discussions These sessions are \nsometimes frustrating to engineers but consistently stretch \ntheir thinking. It makes them curious to understand how \nother projects or teams actually solved their challenges. The \npoint of case studies like these is to force discussions about \nthe decision-making processes used. Hopefully, such frank ndiscussions help individuals learn from these prior missions \nin ways that can help them make better decisions on their \nown missions. Case studies for several missions are \navailable at nhttp://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/organizations10 \nCKO/casestudies/index.html. \nWhile these learning activities are part of Goddard's focus \non increasing near-miss recognition through greater \nawareness another approach is to use quantitative analysis. \nAt NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory \(JPL nlooks at command file errors occurring in the operational \nphase of missions. While most command file errors do not \nresult in loss of mission, in many cases, these errors could \nrepresent a significant threat \(i.e not for good fortune recommendations were developed \nin nine functional areas \(operations design, operations test, \netc data collected from past missions regarding \ncommand file errors [16]. These recommendations are \ndesigned to be cost-effective and to benefit from the \nanalysis of past near-miss events. \n5. CONCLUSION \nMost organizations judge managerial talent less on the \nspecific actions of managers \(i.e., their decisions more \non the outcomes of these actions. Because near-miss events \nare too often perceived as successes rather than a warning \nsignals of the system's vulnerability, research is critically \nneeded that identifies factors that would cause organizations \nto look seriously at chance successes in order to identify and \nlearn from these forewarnings. This research has highlighted \ntwo factors, the perceived significance of the project, and nthe perceived age of the project. NASA has been exploring \nthe use of reflective learning, sharing workshops and \nspecific case studies to highlight lessons from the decision­\nmaking process in an effort to achieve more robust \nindividual learning. These activities provide the opportunity \nto keep project team members focused on recognizing near­\nmisses as projects progress in development and to increase \nawareness that all projects are significant and that near­\nmisses need to be identified in order to prevent future \ncatastrophes. In knowledge-intensive organizations like \nNASA, individual learning and freedom from a near-miss \nbias may help the organization avoid future costly mistakes. \nFurther research would greatly help identify and clarify the nrole of these contributing factors to failures in \norganizational learning that often lead to costly mistakes. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Dillon, R.L. and c.H.

FINAL REMARKS\nIn this paper we presented an approach for supporting the\nenergy-aware adaptation of business processes at design time\ndriven by an optimization problem that takes into account both\ninfrastructural, applicative, and environmental standpoints. In\nparticular, the adaptation actions available to the application\ndesigner rely on the de?nition of variants for the tasks com-\nposing the business process.\nThis approach is now heavily based on the assumption that\nmonitored data about previous executions are available, and\ninformation able to give the values for the interesting metrics\nare all included in this knowledge base. For future development\nof our approach, we aim to relax this assumption, trying to\nunderstand if we can infer the values of the metrics in case\nthe data needed to compute them analytically are not present.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work has been supported by the ECO2Clouds project\n\(http://eco2clouds.eu activity of the 7th Framework\nProgramme under contract number 318048.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Greenpeace, “How Clean Is Your Cloud?,” tech. rep., 04 2012.\n[2] A.

PARTITIONING SCHEME \nIn this section, we describe some additional details of the \npartitioning schemes. For a given n nodes and P processors, \nwe create P partitions Vo, V1 , . . .  Vp-1 . The processors are \nlabeled as 0, 1 ,  . . .  P - 1. Partition Vi is processed by pro­\ncessor i. For each scheme, we need to know i of nodes in each partition, and iii Below we show how to calculate them for the three \npartitioning schemes. \nA.1 Uniform Consecutive Partitioning UCP assigned to the par­\ntitions. \nPartition size: The sizes of the partitions are almost equal. \nLet B = I f5 l Then, the size of a partition is either B or \nB -1. \nPartition range: Partition i includes the nodes from iB nto \(i  + I III J . \nA.2 Linear Consecutive Partitioning \(LCP par­\ntitions, and the number of nodes in the partitions are mod­\neled by arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d a+\(P- l are partition pal'ame­\nters. At the end of this section, we discuss how a and d are \ndetermined. \nPartition range: Partition i has the nodes from L;:? \(a+ \njd 2a+\(?-1 a + jd i + 1 2a?id 1 .  \nFinding processor rank: Given a node u ,  we need to \nfind the partition i such that u E Vi, Node u satisfies the \nfollowing inequality: \ni-I \nl 2a + \(i - l i + 1 2a id 11 pa­\nrameters a and d are determined using the number of nodes \nn and the number of processors P. Parameter d 


is the slope \nof the straight line y = a + dx, where y represent the num­\nber of nodes in the processor with rank x = i. We calcu­\nlate d by finding two points on this straight line. Putting \ni = 0 and i = P -1 in Eqn 10, we can compute nl and \nnp- l .  Then, the number of nodes in the first processor is \nnl - no = nl and the number of nodes in last processor is \nnp - np- l = n - 1 - np- l .  Hence, we have \nNow, we have \nd = \nn - 1 np- l - nl \nP \n. \nP- l \n2 2a + \(P - l P - l Round Robin Partitioning \n\(12 partitions, the number of nodes is almost \nequal for all partitions. Similar to UCP scheme, the size of \na partition is either I f5 l  or I f5 l  - 1. \nPartition range: For round robin partitioning, partition i \nhas the nodes i, i + P, i + 2P, . . .  i + \(B - l parti­\ntion i is determined by i = u mod P. \nComputation load: The expected number of request mes­\nsages received for node k is \(Hn- 1  - Hk see Lemma 3.4 load \nfor node k is CL\(k Hn- 1  - Hk with partition Vi = {j Ij \nmod P = i} is PL\(i Hn- 1  - Hk + b CL\(k1 k2 i l i2 between the loads of two processors is \nPL\(O P -1 Hn- 1  - Hk + b Hn- 1  - Hk + b kEVp_ l  \nS \(Hn- 1  + b 1 V0 1 - l Vp- 1 1 l i = 0, \nkEVrl kEVp_ l  \nL Hk < L Hk + Hn , \nk EVp_ l  kEVrl \nand thus, PL\(O P -1 log n nOtherwise, \n1 V0 1 - l Vp- 1 1 = 1, \nL Hk S L Hk ,  \nk EVp_ l  k EVo \nand thus, PL\(O P -1 O\(log n

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration. This infonnation will be \nused to create a baseline behavior for comparison with \nactual data to discriminate between nonnal and abnormal nbehavior. \nTable 3 is a list of biological diagnostic measurements to be \nincluded in CCSDS telemetry available for ground \npersonnel to complete a prognostic analysis used to predict \nmental illness would be occurring in the near future.

The measurement range is important to defme \nthe 5th or 6th degree polynomial used to convert the 8-bit \ndigital words in telemetry back to analog telemetry so the \ntelemetry processing and display system can accurately \ndisplay the biological and engineering diagnostic \ninformation to ground personnel for analysis. \n1 7  \nTable 3 .

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
