INTRODUCTION \nIn order to address some of the fundamental limitations of \nReynolds-averaged simulation \(RAS large-eddy simulation \(LES especially true for high Reynolds number \nsupersonic wall-bounded flows, which exhibit inherent \nunsteadiness turbulent shock-boundary layer interactions, \nand other complex flow phenomena.  Whereas the RAS \nequations require modeling of turbulence at all length \nscales, the LES equations only require modeling of turbulent nmotions at length scales below a characteristic filter width; \nthe largest turbulent motions are resolved naturally through \nthe solution of the filtered governing equations.  Since these \nlarger turbulent structures are responsible for the majority of \nmass, momentum, and energy transport, LES simulations \nare well-suited for high Reynolds number flows.  \nUnfortunately, the grid densities required for LES \nsimulations of wall-bounded flows often render the \napproach computationally infeasible for problems of \npractical importance. \nIn this study, a hybrid LES/RAS approach is used in \nconjunction with a turbulence recycling procedure to \nsimulate a supersonic flow over a rearward facing step and \nsubsequent reattachment along an inclined wall [1-3].  The \nrecycling process sustains coherent turbulent structure \nwithin the inflow boundary layer without having to simulate \nits development.   Simulation results are compared to \nexperimental mean flow data within the approach turbulent \nboundary layer, through the shear layer, and along the \ninclined wall.  Assessments of the LES/RAS simulations are \nmade using steady-state RAS results and experimental data nThe simulations are designed to assess several recent \ndevelopments to the Viscous Upwind aLgorithm for nComplex flow ANalysis \(VULCAN CFD nnumerics, a hybridized inviscid flux scheme, and inflow \nturbulence recycling [4,5].  Specifically, the current study: \nassesses the applicability of the hybrid LES/RAS method \nfor cavity flows, isolates the effect of inflow turbulence \nrecycling on the flowfield statistics, determines any grid \nsensitivity, and appraises the choice of shock sensor for use \nwith the hybridized inviscid flux scheme.  These objectives \nare achieved by performing seven simulations, which are \nparameterized by solution method, inflow treatment, grid \nsize and shock sensor and are summarized in Table 1.  \nHereafter, each simulation will be referenced using the case nID stated in Table 1.  For example, references will be made \nusing “case R35D”, rather than “case one”, where R, 35, \nand D indicate recycling, 35 million grid cells, and Ducros \nsensor, respectively. \nIn the following

As designed, the current blending \nfunction transitions the RAS formulation to the LES nformulation in the outer region of the boundary layer, near \nthe upper edge of the log layer.  As previous studies have \nindicated [10], targeting the transition for this region at the \nedge of the log layer within the turbulent boundary layer \nyields the most resolved turbulence without adversely \naffecting the universality of the boundary layer.  The \nblending function used in the current study is presented by nEdwards, et. al. [11]. \n \nIn order to reduce numerical dissipation in smooth flow \nregions, while maintaining the dissipation necessary to \ncapture discontinuities elsewhere, a hybridized flux scheme \nis used to 


construct interface inviscid fluxes.  This \nhybridization is implemented as the linear combination of a nlow-dissipation, symmetrically-reconstructed inviscid flux \nand a conventional upwind-biased flux.  The low-dissipation \nflux formulation uses left and right states constructed to \nhigher-order accuracy at the cell interfaces using a four-\npoint symmetric interpolation on the primitive variables \n[12].  A dissipative flux is then computed by first using the \npiecewise-parabolic method of Collela and Woodward to \nconstruct primitive variables at either side of a cell interface \nand subsequently using the Harten, Lax, van Leer, and nContact \(HLLC 10,13-\n15].  The final hybridized inviscid interface flux is \ncomputed by blending the low-dissipative and dissipative \nfluxes using a shock sensor weighting parameter.  The two \nshock sensor formulations of Ducros 16] and Larsson [17] \nare used in this study.  Each of the shock sensors are \ndesigned to dynamically adjust the inviscid flux calculation.  \nIn regions of viscous, smooth flow, the shock sensor \nemphasizes the low-dissipation formulation more heavily, \nwhereas in regions of large inviscid gradients, the \ndissipative flux formulation is more heavily weighted.  The \nlower bound for each of these sensors was modified to nprovide a small level of background dissipation for the \ncurrent work.  Rather than allowing the sensor to range from \n0.0 to 1.0, each shock sensor is bounded by 0.2 and 1.0, \nthereby preventing numerical instabilities arising within the \nshear layer reattachment region.  A detailed development of \nthis hybridized method is presented by White, et. al. [5]. \nIn order to sustain coherent structure within the turbulent ninflow boundary layer, turbulent fluctuations and relevant \nturbulence properties are recycled from a plane one cavity-\ndepth upstream of the step.  Fluctuations are extracted from \nthe donor plane by subtracting timeand span-averaged \nmean flow data from the instantaneous flow data.  These \nfluctuations are scaled according to boundary-layer \nsimilarity laws before being superimposed to a mean flow \nprofile.  Initial fluctuations are provided by a previously-\nsimulated fully-resolved \(via LES which provides the turbulence necessary for \nefficient recycling without necessitating the natural ndevelopment of such structures.  Details of the recycling \nprocedure are described by Choi, et. al. [10 Xiao, et. al. \n[18], and Fan, et. al. [19].  \n4. COMPUTATIONAL EXECUTION  \nSimulations are performed on structured three-dimensional \nfine and coarse grids of 35 and 8.8 million cells, \nrespectively.  The coarse grid was constructed by removing \nevery other grid point in each of the streamwise and \nspanwise directions of the fine grid.  The grid generated for \nthis study is composed of four primary blocks, as shown in \nFig. 3 The two upper blocks are connected to the lower \nblocks via non-C0 continuous patches.  Similarly, the lower nleft block is attached to the lower right block by a non-C0 \ncontinuous patch where only the spanwise coordinates are \nmismatched \(the downstream spacing is twice that of the \nupstream spacing grid, streamwise-transverse-\nspanwise dimensions of the blocks adjacent to the wall \ndirectly upstream and downstream of the step are \n525x121x301 and 453x241x151, respectively; dimensions \nof the upper left and right blocks are 29x45x15 and \n153x45x15, respectively.  The patches connecting the lower \nand upper blocks are positioned far enough from the domain \nof interest to ensure that resolved boundary layer and free \nshear layer eddies are not convected into them.   \n \nFigure 3—Three-dimensional domain coarsened twice in \nthe streamwise and transverse directions and once in the \nspanwise dimension for visual clarity. \nThe physical dimensions of the computational domain are \n28.6cm, 22.5cm, and 3.81cm in each of the streamwise, \ntransverse and spanwise directions, respectively.  The flat \nplate extended four step heights upstream of the step, which n  4\nis a factor of two further upstream than in previous studies \nto allow for recycling of turbulent fluctuations.  The grid \nwas clustered in the wall-normal direction to provide a \nnominal y+ of 1.0 [5,20 The streamwise and spanwise \ngrid spacing was set to 1/20th of the boundary layer \nthickness.  Downstream of the step, the grid clustering \nrequired by the approach flow boundary layer was relaxed \ntoward a more isotropic grid for the resulting shear layer.  \nThe average streamwise, transverse, and spanwise spacing \nin this region was 2.0%, 0.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, of \nthe cavity depth \(2.54cm the LES \nregions was no greater than approximately 20.0.  The wide \ngrid used for case R8DW extended 4.5 cavity depths in the \nspanwise direction and maintained the same grid spacing \nand clustering as the coarse grid.  The width of the \ncomputational domain was increased by a factor of three to \ninvestigate potential correlations between two-point \nstatistics that may be present in the original domain size.  \nThe three-dimensional fine and coarse grids were split into \n1980 sub-blocks to allow runtime parallelization using \nMessage Passing Interface \(MPI on \nthe fine grid required approximately 360 hours of wall clock \ntime on 512 processors.  The same simulations performed \non the coarse grid required about 90 hours of wall clock \ntime on 512 processors nInflow profiles and flowfield initializations for the \nLES/RAS cases were obtained using the NR8RAS case, in 


nwhich the Menter k-? turbulence model was used with a \ncompressibility correction [8,21].  Further, the free stream \nflow was allowed to develop until the momentum thickness \none cavity-depth upstream of the step matched experimental \nmeasurements.  A significant spread in solutions was \nobtained using various turbulence models for the \npreliminary RAS simulation, and the RAS results used in \nthis study represent those in best agreement with \nexperimental data.  Nominal inflow conditions included: \nstatic pressure of 21.2kPa, Mach number of 2.92, and \ntemperature of 92.4K.  For all LES/RAS cases, periodic \nboundary conditions were used in the homogeneous-\nspanwise direction.  All walls were assumed adiabatic and \nno slip, except for the vertical wall during coarse grid runs, \nwhere wall functions were applied due to excessively-high \ny+ values observed there during runtime.  For all runs, an \nextrapolation condition was applied at the exit plane, and a ncharacteristic condition was enforced at the far-field plane.   \nThe governing equations were integrated using a dual-time-\nstepping approach, in which the diagonalized approximate \nfactorization \(DAF used for integration in \npseudo time with a maximum Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy \n\(CFL second-order three-point \nbackwards finite difference approximation was used for \nintegration in physical time 22,23].  Convergence was \ndefined as achieving a residual reduction of 2.5 orders-of-\nmagnitude or as reaching a limiting number of 15 sub-\niterations.  The physical time step was set to 0.1µs for each \nLES/RAS simulation.  Following initialization, the flowfield \nwas evolved for a minimum of 25 characteristic flow-\nthrough times before taking statistics.  A characteristic flow-\nthrough time was defined as the time required for a particle \nin the free stream to travel from the corner of the step to the \npoint of reattachment of the free shear layer along the \ninclined wall—approximately 0.2ms.  Statistical stationarity nwas confirmed by comparing independent sets of statistics \ngathered at intervals of five flow-through times After 25 \nflow-through times, the flowfield was statistically \nstationary, and statistics were gathered for a final five flow-\nthrough times at a rate of 0.5µs.  These statistics were \nsubsequently averaged spatially in the homogeneous \nspanwise direction.  The RAS turbulence model constants \nwere set according to Menter [8 and SGS turbulence \nmodel constants were set as suggested by Yoshizawa and \nHoriuti [9].   \n5. RESULTS \nThe simulations reproduced the major flow phenomena \nobserved in the experiment, as seen in Fig. 4; the supersonic nflow upstream of the cavity detaches at the step corner, \nthereby creating a free shear layer over the cavity.  This free \nshear layer attaches along the inclined wall and interacts \nwith an oblique shock front standing off the inclined wall.  \nFluid is entrained into the cavity near the location of shear \nlayer attachment, and this fluid creates a recirculation zone \nwhich drives an unsteady low-frequency motion of the free \nshear layer.  Note that in Fig. 4, annotations are included \nthat indicate major flow features and identify each image’s \nrelative location in time, which is given as the value of \nelapsed time, ?t, divided by the characteristic flow-through \ntime, ??.  In the following subsections, results are presented \nand organized according to study objective, namely: \nassessment of solution accuracy via comparison to \nexperiment for the baseline case \(R35D R8D R8DW sensitivity by comparing fine grid \nsolutions \(R35D and R35L R8D and R8L determination of inflow turbulence \nrecycling effects by comparing cases with \(R8D NR8D R35D and R8D R35L and R8L comparing results to experimental data, the approach \nboundary layer was confirmed to have developed properly nThis confirmation was necessary to ensure that the recycling \nprocedure did not adversely affect the inflow boundary layer \nstatistics.  For both the fine grid and coarse grid cases, \nboundary layer velocity profiles at several planes upstream\n  5\n \nFigure 4—Instantaneous snapshots of velocity magnitude at the spanwise centerline plane for case R35D with the \nrecycle plane, major flow features, and data extraction locations marked.\nof the step were compared to theoretical predictions based \non Cole’s Law-of-the-Wall formulation and the original \nRAS solutions under the van Driest transformation \ndescribed by Choi, et. al. [10].  These three planes included \nthe inflow plane, the donor recycling plane, and a plane at \nthe step corner.  For each case and at each plane, the \naveraged LES/RAS results agreed well with both the \ntheoretical log-layer predictions and with RAS data.  The \ncomparisons for cases R35D and R8D at the recycling plane \nare included in Fig. 5 to demonstrate the level of agreement.  \nIn each case and at each plane, the LES/RAS simulations \nreproduced the slope and location of the log-layer well, and \nthe blending function anchored the mean LES/RAS \ntransition point near the upper edge of the log-layer.  Thus, \nthe LES/RAS approach and recycling procedure provide nproper development of the boundary layer upstream of the \nstep. \nMean velocity and static pressure at several planes are \ncompared with experimental data in Fig. 6 for each case, \nthough details of the baseline case R35D, are highlighted in \nthis section.  The results of cases R35L, R8L, and R8DW \nare omitted from Fig. 6 due 


to their superb agreement with \ncases R35D, R8D, and R8D, respectively, and will be \ndiscussed later.  Note that in Fig. 6, an * denotes a value \nnormal to the wall, ? indicates a free stream condition, ? is \nthe approach boundary layer thickness, and all spatial \ndimensions are non-dimensionalized by the cavity depth, D nThe results of case R35D agree well with the experimental \ndata, except within the cavity region.  Static pressure along \nthe inclined wall and at the chosen planes normal to the \ninclined wall agree well with experiment and mark an \nincrease in accuracy, as compared to case NR8RAS.  The \nvelocity data at planes normal to the inclined wall also mark \nan increase in accuracy.  The improved agreement in static \npressure and velocity data along the inclined wall is no \nsurprise, as it is known that RAS models tend to severely nover-predict the boundary layer recovery rate when free \nshear flows reattach to solid surfaces.  However while case \nR35D more accurately predicts the shear layer spreading \nrate, it is apparent the shear layer is deflected toward the \ncavity floor.  Forming a “best-fit” line anchored at the step \ncorner that follows the shear layer formed in the R35D case \nresults in a deflection angle of 2.85°.   \nRecycle Plane\nShear Layer\nRecirculation\nData Locations\nReattachment\n  6\n \nFigure 5—Velocity and blending function in the \napproach boundary layer for cases R35D and R8D at the \nrecycling plane. \nCase R8DW was performed to determine whether slow-\nmoving, large-scale motions within the cavity were \nartificially limited on the baseline computational domain.  \nThe results of this case confirmed that no such artificial \nforcing occurred on the original narrow coarse grid.  \nTherefore, the authors posit that the experimental data may \nexhibit effects of the tunnel sidewalls and aerodynamic \nfences, which were not modeled in the current study; \nprevious efforts have shown that three-dimensional effects \nplay a significant role in flow separation even when \nextensive steps are taken in the experiments to ensure some \nlevel of two-dimensionality [24].  In order to clearly \nillustrate shear layer spreading rate comparisons, each of the \ncavity velocity profiles are shifted vertically in Fig. 7 until \nthe point of inflection is approximately aligned with that of \nthe experimental data.  As expected fine grid cases predict \nthe spreading rate well, and coarse grid cases display \nweaker agreement.  Case R35D indicates significant \nimprovement as compared to the other cases.  It should be \nnoted that case NR8D is in less agreement than R8D, which \nindicates an effect of recycled turbulent structure on shear \nlayer development and will be discussed later. \n \nFigure 6—Velocity and pressure for cases R35D \(blue dashed line R8D \(magenta dash-dot line orange dash-\ndot-dot line solid red line open triangles 104\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nFR35D\nFR8D\nu+R35D\nu+R8D\nu+NR8RAS\nu+log law\nu+ = y+\n0 1\nx/D=1.5\nu/\n0 1\nx/D=2.5\nU\n?\n0 1\nx/D=3.5\nx*/D\nP/\nP ?\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\nEXP\nNR8RAS\nR35D\nR8D\nNR8D\ny/\nD\n0 1\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\nx/D=-1.0\n0 1\nx*/D=4.6\nU\n?\n0 1\nx*/D=3.8\nu*/\n0 1\nx*/D=5.4\ny*\n/?\n0 1\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nx*/D=2.7\ny*\n/?\n0 1 2 3\n0.0\n0.4\n0.8\n1.2\n1.6\n2.0\nx*/D=2.7\n1 2 3 4\nx*/D=4.6\nP\n?\n1 2 3 4\nx*/D=3.8\nP/\n1 2 3 4\nx*/D=5.4\n  7\nGrid Sensitivity \nGrid sensitivity was assessed by comparing results of cases \nR35D and R8D.  Case R8D utilized a once-coarsened \nversion of case R35D’s grid in the streamwise and spanwise \ndirections; coarsening the transverse direction would have \nyielded unacceptably-large values of y+ for integrate-to-the-\nwall solutions Based on these two cases, the grid \nsensitivity of the solution is significant.  The coarsened grid \nfails to resolve adequate levels of turbulence, as compared \nto the fine grid, which is illustrated in Fig. 8, where ninstantaneous Mach number contours at the spanwise \ncenter-line are presented.  Note that while the turbulent nfluctuations in the approach flow boundary layer are well-\nresolved for both cases, these fluctuations and ncorresponding turbulent motions are resolved to a lesser \ndegree moving downstream of the step on the coarse grid. \n \nFigure 7—Velocity profiles translated vertically to \ndemonstrate spreading rate agreement for cases R35D \n\(blue dashed line magenta dash-dot line orange dash-dot-dot line red solid line open triangles R35D \(top bottom resolved TKE \nand SGS TKE contributions downstream of the step, which \nare plotted in Fig. 9 at several locations through the shear \nlayer.  The percentage of resolved turbulence is calculated \naccording to Eq 1 1 1 is 71%, 80%, and \n85% resolved at each plane, respectively, the turbulence is \nonly 30%, 36%, and 50% resolved at the same planes for \ncase R8D.  Typically, the desired level of resolved \nturbulence for LES of high Reynolds number flows is in the \n80-90% range [25-27].  In case R8D, the dominance of \nTKEsgs leads to more reliance on the SGS model, which in \nthis case yields a larger disagreement with the experimental \ndata. \n nFigure 9—TKE profiles for cases R35D and R8D.  The \nblue dashed line and red solid line are the SGS TKE for 


ncases R35D and R8D, respectively, and the gray dash-\ndot-dot line and green dash-dot line are the resolved nTKE for cases R35D and R8D, respectively. \nInflow Recycling \nThe effect of inflow turbulence recycling on the mean \nflowfield statistics was isolated by rerunning case R8D \nwithout recycling.  The flow upstream of the step was \nsimulated using pure RAS, since without the sustained \ncoherent turbulent structure within the approach boundary \nlayer, the boundary layer was at risk of partially re-\nlaminarizing.  As can be seen in Figs. 6 and 7, the results of \ncase NR8D are significantly different from those of case \nR8D; the shear layer is significantly higher, the spreading \nrate is lower, the static pressure within the cavity is higher, \nand the shear layer reattachment point is further \ndownstream.  From the pressure data, it is evident that the noblique shock makes a shallower angle with the inclined \nwall as compared to case R8D.  Explanation of such a ndiscrepancy requires consideration of several codependent \nfluid mechanical phenomena, including the transport of \n0 1\nx/D=1.5\nu/\n0 1\nx/D=2.5\nU\n?\n0 1\nx/D=3.5\ny/\nD\n0 1\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\nEXP\nNR8RAS\nR35D\nR8D\nNR8D\nx/D=-1.0\ny/\nD\n0 0.01 0.02\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\nTKEMOD R35D\nTKERES, R35D\nTKEMOD, R8D\nTKERES, R8D\nx/D = 0.7\nTKE/U2inf\n0 0.01 0.02\nx/D = 1.1\n0 0.01 0.02\nx/D = 1.9\n 8\nmass through the shear layer and the reattachment point’s \nimpact on mass entrainment into the cavity Turbulent \ntransport through the shear layer is illustrated in Fig. 10 by \nlineplots of the Reynolds shear stress component, ?????????????.  \nThrough the shear layer, significantly less mass transfer \noccurs for case NR8D as compared to cases NR8RAS, R8D, \nand R35D, thereby driving the static pressure within the \ncavity higher.  As the shear layer moves vertically, the \nreattachment point moves further downstream, thereby nreducing the incident angle of the shear layer with the \ninclined wall.  As this angle lessens, the amount of fluid \nbeing entrained into the cavity reduces further.  Contrary to \nearlier examinations of this flow, the current results \ndemonstrate the criticality of sustaining coherent turbulence \nwithin the approach boundary layer when employing the \nmost recent developments to VULCAN for such a flow \n[5,28]. \nFigure 10—Reynolds shear stress component for cases \nNR8RAS \(red solid line blue dashed line black dash-dot-dot line magenta dash-dot \nline comparing \ncases R35D and R35L and cases R8D and R8L.  The \nDucros sensor was considered the baseline for this study.  \nBoth shock sensors are designed to compare the magnitude \nof the divergence and curl of velocity however, the Larsson \nsensor includes logic that toggles the interface flux \napproximation to either fully-upwind or fully-symmetric, \nversus the Ducros sensor’s blending of the two.  The result \nof this difference is illustrated in Fig. 11, where an \ninstantaneous snapshot of the shock sensor is presented for ncases R8D and R8L.  Note how the Larsson sensor tends to \nconfine the upwind flux formulation to regions near the \noblique shock.  The Ducros switch uses the centrally-\ndifferenced flux formulation through most of the cavity \nregion and behind the oblique shock.  However, the Ducros \nswitch employs the upwind flux formulation above the shear \nlayer, since by design, any small fluctuation in otherwise \nsmooth, inviscid flow triggers such switch behavior.  \nResults of cases R35L and R8L are statistically equivalent \nto those of R35D and R8D respectively.  For such reason, \nthe results are omitted from Fig. 6, and therefore, the mean \nflow statistics are independent of whether the Ducros or \nLarsson shock sensor is used for the current simulations.  \n \nFigure 11—Instantaneous shock sensor contours for \ncases R8D \(top bottom plane. \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nSimulations of a supersonic cavity flow exhibiting a \nreattaching free shear layer utilizing recent developments to \nthe VULCAN CFD code were conducted in order to: assess \nthe applicability of LES/RAS, isolate the effect of inflow \nturbulence recycling, determine any sensitivity of the \nsolution to grid density, and evaluate the effect of shock \nsensor choice for use with a hybridized flux scheme.  Two ngrids were used—a fine grid consisting of 35 million cells \nand a coarsened version of the same grid constructed of 8.8 \nmillion cells.  A baseline run was performed on the fine grid \nusing the Ducros sensor Two cases were performed on the \ncoarsened grid with the Ducros switch toggling the inflow \nturbulence recycling on and off.  The cases performed with \nrecycling were repeated using the Larsson switch to isolate nthe effect of shock sensor choice.  Results utilizing the fine \ngrid compared quite well with experimental data outside of \nthe cavity region.  Through the cavity region, velocity \nprofiles indicated excellent shear layer spreading rate \nagreement but disagreement in vertical location of the shear \nlayer.  This discrepancy may be the result of three-\ndimensional sidewall effects not considered in the current \nstudy.  Even though measures were taken during the \nexperiment to promote two-dimensionality, such as \naerodynamic fences previous studies have indicated that \nsuch approaches likely do not completely alleviate the \neffects of three-dimensionality [24].  Based on the \ncomparisons of cases R35D and R8D, the solution is nstrongly-sensitive to grid density.  Grid convergence was \nnot empirically proven based on mean statistics however, \nsimulations performed on the fine grid proved to resolve a \nreasonable fraction of the turbulence

Cases R8D and NR8D suggest inflow \nturbulence recycling plays a pivotal role in proper shear \nlayer development.  Without recycling, significantly less \nmass is exchanged through the shear layer, allowing higher \nstatic pressures to build within the cavity.  Subsequently, as \nthe shear layer lifts, less fluid is entrained into the cavity, \nand the reattachment point moves further downstream.  The \noblique shock makes a shallower angle with the inclined \nwall, thereby causing severe disagreement in velocity and \npressure data as compared to experiment.  Finally, the \nchoice of shock sensor was found to have a negligible effect \non the mean flow statistics.  The sensors of Ducros and \nLarsson were considered, and the results illustrate the \nrelative insensitivity to the detailed functional form chosen \nfor the shock sensor.  Future work will address the three-\ndimensionality concerns raised in the current study nREFERENCES  \n[1] Settles, G.S., Baca, B.K., Williams, D.R., and Bogdanoff, \nS.M., “A study of reattachment of a free shear layer in \ncompressible turbulent flow,” AIAA Paper 80-1408, July \n1980. \n[2] Horstman, C.C Settles, G.S., Bogdanoff, S.M., and \nWilliams, D.R., “A reattaching free shear layer in \ncompressible turbulent flow—A comparison of numerical \nand experimental results,” AIAA Paper 81-0333, Jan. \n1981. \n[3 Settles, G.S., Williams, D.R., Baca, B.K., and Bogdanoff, \nS.M., “Reattachment of a compressible turbulent free \nshear layer,” AIAA J., Vol. 20\(1  Analysis \n\(VULCAN  and \nBlack, W.S., “Low-dissipation advection schemes \ndesigned for large eddy simulations of hypersonic npropulsion systems,” AIAA Paper 2012-4263, July 2012. \n[6] Baurle, R.A., Tam, C.J., Edwards, J.R., and Hassan, H.A., \n“A hybrid simulation approach for cavity flows: blending, \nalgorithm, and boundary treatment issues,” AIAA J., Vol. \n41\(8  Reynolds-\naveraged/large-eddy simulations of a coaxial supersonic \nfreejet experiment,” AIAA J., Vol. 48\(3 2010, pp. 551-\n571. \n[8] Menter, F.R., “Zonal two equation k-? models for \naerodynamic flows,” AIAA Paper 92-0439, Jan. 1992. \n[9] Yoshizawa, A., and Horiuti, K., “A statistically-derived \nsubgrid scale kinetic energy model for large-eddy \nsimulation of turbulent flows,” J.

Hardware [21] and OS level [17]\ncache partitioning, user level thread scheduling [34], and\ncompiler-time transformation [22, 25 are proposed to mit-\nigate resource contention among processes and/or threads.\nHowever, they only work for independent threads or pro-\ncesses with no communication or sharing relationships.\nHolistic Mapping. [26 exploits thread mapping for op-\ntimizing multi-threaded datacenter applications on CMPs.\nHowever, the mapping policies in [26] either use exhaustive\nsearch or require a new algorithm for each type of cache\ntopology. Our new contributions include an in-depth study\nof streaming application’s cache behavior and a holistic\nmapping algorithm which is more general and scalable.\nB. Optimizing Streaming Applications on CMPs\nAlgorithmic Optimization of Streaming Algorithms. Exam-\nples include join [27, 11], aggregation [6], sorting [10 and\nfrequency counting [7]. Operators in a streaming program\nmay interact with each other in complicated ways and\nsuch complexity is manifested at thread level at runtime.\nManaging such complicated interaction is beyond the scope\nof tuning individual operators, so orchastration provided by\nStreamMap is necessary to coordinate threads’ execution.\nBesides, StreamMap does not require knowledge of opera-\ntors’ internal implementation, and uses pro?ling information\ncollected at middleware level to make mapping decisions.\nTherefore, StreamMap is orthogonal and complementary to\ncode tuning of individual streaming operators.\nCompile-Time Scheduling and Mapping of Streaming Pro-\ngrams on CMPs. Pioneered by StreamIt [13], work has\nbeen done in optimizing static scheduling of streaming\nprograms on multicores [16, 29, 30]. Those work apply\ncompiler analysis and code transformation to exploit various\nparallelism in program to balance computation load among\nthreads. Since most of those work target Cell B.E. architec-\n630\nture which has explicitly managed memory hierarchy, they\ncommonly try to hide data movement cost by overlapping\ncommunication with computation in the execution schedule.\nIn comparison, StreamMap targets cache topologies seen in\nx86 CMP architecture which impose distinct challenges such\nas contention on shared resources, and it works at thread\nlevel without heroic compiler analysis.\nCache-Aware Optimization of Streaming Programs. [23]\nproposed three techniques to optimize StreamIt programs\non a uniprocessor: execution scaling, buffer manager, and\nregister replacement. [20] extends execution scaling to multi-\ncore. Both work assumes synchronous data ?ow model to\ncalculate static steady state schedule, and [20] does not\nconsider thread mapping to reduce contention or thread\nsynchronization cost 4] theoretically shows that cache-\nef?cient scheduling of streaming programs on a uniprocessor\ncan be modeled as a partitioning problem and some special\ncases can be solved in polynomial time. Our work targets\nmulti-core processors, uses mapping algorithms different\nfrom the one proposed in [4], implements those algorithms\ninside System S middleware, and evaluates them with real-\nworld applications on representative architectures.\nVII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper demonstrates that CMP’s cache topology can\nhave a signi?cant impact on the performance of multi-\nthreaded streaming applications. Our StreamMap approach\nautomatically places threads 


to cores to control the data\nsharing and resource contention between threads, and can\nimprove real-world streaming applications’ performance by\nup to 1.8 times over the default Linux OS scheduler.\nFuture directions of this research are twofold. We plan to\nstudy how to use StreamMap to provide feedback informa-\ntion to System S’ compiler to optimize operator fusion. We\nalso plan to apply StreamMap to a wider range of streaming\napplications, e.g., dynamic graph analysis.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Dynamorio: Dynamic instrumentation tool platform.\nhttp://www.dynamorio.org, October 2012.\n[2] Likwid: Lightweight performance tools.\nhttp://code.google.com/p/likwid, October 2012.\n[3] Scotch: Static mapping, graph, mesh and hypergraph partitioning.\nhttp://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/, October 2012.\n[4] K.

In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

I will show recent examples of the use of nonlinear control theory for the assimilation and con-\ntrol of single neuron and network dynamics, a control framework for Parkinson’s disease, and the potential \nfor unification in control of spreading depression and seizures. Lastly, I will discuss why the subtle and \ndeep intersection of symmetry, in brains and models, is important to take into account in this transdisci-\nplinary fusion of computational models of the computational brain with real time control.  \n Biographical Sketch: Steven J.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
