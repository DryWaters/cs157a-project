Large-Scale Data Challenges in Future Power Grids \nJian Yin, Poorva Sharma, Ian Gorton, Bora Akyol \nPacific Northwest National Laboratory \nRichland WA, USA \n{jian.yin, ian.gorton, poorva.sharma, bora} @pnnl.gov  \n nAbstract \nThis paper describes technical challenges in \nsupporting large-scale real-time data analysis for nfuture power grid systems and discusses various design \noptions to address these challenges. Even though the nexisting U.S. power grid has served the nation \nremarkably well over the last 120 years, big changes \nare in the horizon. The widespread deployment of \nrenewable generation, smart grid controls, energy \nstorage, plug-in hybrids, and new conducting materials \nwill require fundamental changes in the operational \nconcepts and principal components. The whole system \nbecomes highly dynamic and needs constant \nadjustments based on real time data. Even though \nmillions of sensors such as phase measurement units \n\(PMUs widely deployed, a \ndata layer that can support this amount of data in real \ntime is needed. Unlike the data fabric in cloud services, \nthe data layer for smart grids must address some \nunique challenges. This layer must be scalable to \nsupport millions of sensors and a large number of \ndiverse applications and still provide real time \nguarantees. Moreover, the system needs to be highly \nreliable and highly secure because the power grid is a \ncritical piece of infrastructure. No existing systems can \nsatisfy all the requirements at the same time. We \nexamine various design options. In particular, we \nexplore the special characteristics of power grid data \nto meet both scalability and quality of service \nrequirements. Our initial prototype can improve nperformance by orders of magnitude over existing \ngeneral-purpose systems. The prototype was \ndemonstrated with several use cases from PNNL’s \nFPGI and was shown to be able to integrate huge \namount of data from a large number of sensors and a \ndiverse set of applications.    \n \n1. INTRODUCTION  \nWhile the power grid infrastructure has been \nrelatively stable for the last few decades, some \ndramatic changes are about to take place. Driven by \neconomical and environmental considerations, the grid \nis moving from a slow and static paradigm to a \ndynamic and real time system. For example, because \npower generation from renewable resources such as \nsolar and wind are affected by weather and can be vary \nconstantly, the whole power system must constantly \nadjust to match supply against demand. Incentives are \nused to shift power usage to match supply Millions of \nsensors include phasor measurement units \(PMUs generation, \ntransmission, and consumption sides.  These sensors \ncan generate a huge amount of data in real time. For \nexample, PMUs can produce a measurement every tens \nof milliseconds. These data must be collected ningested, delivered to analytics applications to generate \ncontrol decision to improve efficiency and reliability of \npower grid. In previous work by us and other \nresearchers [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], we have identified \nand developed several applications that can be used to \noptimize power grid operations.  \nHowever the huge amount of data and the diverse \nset of applications must be integrated to fulfill the U.S nDepartment of Energy’s \(DOE naccommodate changing loads, generation technologies, \nand operating business models?”1 The combination of nscalability, system complexity, reliability, and real time \nrequirements introduces unique challenges. Begun in \n2010, PNNL’s Future Power Grid Initiative \(FPGI nrequirements that our system needs to support as:  \n \nScalability: Our system must be able to handle a huge namount of data from millions of sensors including \nphase measurement units \(PMU sensors can generate a measurement every tens \nof milliseconds. \n \nReal Time: Our system must provide predictable real \ntime performance for large-scale data analysis \napplications using both current and historical data from \nmillions of sensors. \n \nHigh Reliability: Because the power grid is a critical \npiece of infrastructure, continuous operation without \ninterruption is essential. In fact, computer hardware and \n n1 DOE Quadrennial Technology Review 2011, Grid \nModernization, page 81.

Given that the system can consist of \na large number of hardware and software components, \npartial failures are unavoidable. Thus, the system must \nhandle partial failures gracefully without causing \nservice interruption. \nSecurity: Power grid data can contain business \nsensitive information of utility companies and privacy \ndata from customers. We not only must ensure that the \nsensitive data are not leaked, but also make sure that \nthere are no sensitive information can be inferred from \nthe data that are transferred to a third party. \nLow Cost: The cost can be a major factor that can \naffect deployment. The system must leverage both \nhigh-end hardware as well as commodity hardware. \nWhile the high end users can pay the cost of high-end \nhardware for performance, low end users can chose \ntheir desirable 


tradeoff between cost and performance. \nIn summary, the data analysis systems for future \npower grid systems face many unique challenges, \nwhich include real time guarantees, scalability in term \nof the amount of data and the diverse of application to \nsupport, high reliability, and security. No existing \nsystems can meet these requirements at same time. For \nexample, the most commonly used system in power \ngrid system, the OSIsoft PI system [22], can provide \nreal time guarantees but is not scalable to millions of \nsensors to be deployed in future power grids. The data \nsystems developed in other domain can handle big data \nbut can not meet the real time, reliability, and security \nrequirements of power grid systems. Leveraging the \nspecial characteristics of power grid data and \napplication workloads is essential. In the next section, \nwe discuss various design options that are promising in \naddress those challenges. Then we describe the related \nwork and summarize our discussion. \n2. DESIGN OPTIONS  \nThe combination of scalability and real time \nrequirements makes power grid data challenging. To \nstore and retrieve power grid data, traditional systems \nsuch as OSIsoft [22] can either keep the data in \nrelational databases, or in time series specific formats \nsuch as real time historian in OSIsoft. The relational \ndatabase approach allows exact data to be stored and narbitrary queries over the data. Time series data formats \nonly allow a limit set of queries, which may prevent it \nfrom being used in some future advanced applications. \nIt is also built on top of high level system interfaces, \nwhich may lead to inefficiency and unpredictability and \nprevent it from achieving latency in the order of \nmilliseconds. \nWe observed that there are several special \ncharacteristics of power grid data that we can leverage. \nFirst, the power grid data is highly structured. Second, \npower grid data are measurements from the physical \nsystems and they are not random. Predication based \nlossless compression can achieve significant data \nreduction without information loss. Compact data \nformat reduce both data transfer and retrieval overhead. \nThird, there is strong temporal locality in power grid \ndata in both data generation and data consumption. \nStore the data with temporal locality allow fast \ningestion and retrieve. We implemented a prototype \nbased on these observations. In our prototype, we build \nspecialized index for data retrieval based on the set of \npower grid application. We aggregated the main \nmemory and SSD to store indexes. As a result, every \ndata access reduces to one disk operation.  \nGiven that the system can consist of a large number \nof hardware and software components, partial failures \nare unavoidable. To ensure that the system can continue \nto provide service even with partial failures, replication \nmust be used. However replication introduces \nconsistency requirements. Maintain fault tolerant \nconsistency across a large-scale system can \nsignificantly increase latency and prevent real time \nconstraints to be met. We observe that we can make \npower grid data immutable if we include time stamps or \nversion numbers as an identifier to a piece of power \ngrid data. Make the data immutable remove the need to \nmaintain consistency and thus speed up our system. \nOur experimental results, as illustrated in Figure 1 \nand 2, show that we can achieve order of magnitude \nreduction in response times for both data ingestion and \nretrieval. \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Performance comparison between existing \ncommercial software and our prototype for data \ningestion. \n \n325\n \nFigure 2 Performance comparison between existing \ncommercial software and our prototype for data \ndelivery. \nWe also implemented a simple anomaly detection \nalgorithm develop in FPGI at PNNL. We measured the \nend-to-end performance of the anomaly detection \napplication as well as the amount of time that would \ntake just to transmit the data need for the application \nover the network. Our preliminary results show that our \nsystem gets very close to the hardware limits. This is \nbecause 1 possible so we do not suffer the high \noverhead from high level system interfaces; 2 integration achieved in our infrastructure \nallow us to overlap computation with I/O. \nWe use a layered approach and the data access layer \nis at the bottom layer. This layer provides uniformed \nAPIs to allow power grid data analytics and control \napplication to achieve real time data access. This \nlayered approach enables reuse and allow fast data \naccess mechanisms to be used by any applications that \nuse those APIs. \n4. RELATED WORK  \nMost existing data-driven middleware platforms are \neither designed for small-scale applications or built on \ntop of high level system software and APIs [11][12]. \nMuch indirection is introduced into these systems, \nwhich can cause both high overhead and \nunpredictability due to alternative execution path. For ninstance, to allow arbitrary inserts, deletions and \nmodifications, we need to traverse the metadata block nand possibly several levels of indirection blocks, before \nwe can access the data. We address all these issues by \nproviding low-level control to programmers to avoid \nindirection as described in Section 4.1.  \nIn the distributed computing area, GridStat is a \nmiddleware framework managing the quality of service \nof data dissemination in the power grid [10]. GridStat \nuses publish/subscribe notification framework to collect \nand match QoS requirements such as latency and rate. \nExisting research in software frameworks have \nrecently adopted service oriented architecture to cope \nwith comprehensive data exchange in layers between \ndifferent 


stakeholders [6]-[8]. According to [9], service \noriented architectures and Web services offer a flexible \nand extensible approach to integration of multiple, often \nautonomous, data sources and analysis procedures nService oriented technologies support interoperability \nwith other power grid frameworks \(e.g., SCADA nthrough the use of emerging standards including \nCommon Interface Model \(IEC 61970/61968 Architecture \(IEC 62541 utility domain. The OPC UA can be \nviewed as a platform for interoperability and service-\nbased communication However, a significant design \nfactor to consider is the performance overhead of \nSOAP-encoding of Web Services. Performance \nbenchmarks have demonstrated the performance \noverhead of Web Services can be several times larger \nthan conventional distributed protocols of remote \nmethod invocation [5].  \nAll these individual technologies focus on specific \nlayers of the technology stack. However a \ncomprehensive framework is essential to connect \napplications and data sources across technology layers. \nMicrosoft defined a Smart Energy Reference \nArchitecture \(SERA  well as data \nwarehousing and storage approach. SERA provides a \nview for mapping from standards to specific Microsoft \nproducts and technologies. The purpose of SERA is to \nhelp organizations find information on Microsoft \ntechnology components if the organization is interested \nin specific smart grid component. One use case of \nSERA is AREVA’s e-terra platform for delivering \ndistribution management capabilities2. e-terra allows \nutilities to plug in new automation capability and \nassociated information sources. The e-terra platform is \nbuilt on Microsoft Windows and delegates the data \nmanagement tasks to Microsoft SQL server nEven though there are many other system \nintegration frameworks, we face the unique challenge \nin the need to accommodate large amounts of real time \ndata and to allow development of diverse power \nsystem applications We tackle this challenge by \nbalancing the need for ease of integration with real \ntime performance requirements. While high level data \nand communication software layers make integration \neasier, indirection causes high overhead and \nunpredictable performance.  We designed our system \nto be close to hardware as possible and still provide a \nthin and light weighted layer to allow easy integration \nof a diverse set of applications. Our previous work \noutlines the use cases and general design requirements \n n \n326\n[15]. In the following sections, we present the \ntechnology implementation in detail.  \n5. CONCLUSION  \nIn this paper, we examine the big data challenges in \nthe future power grid. As the power grid moves from \nstatic and slow paradigm to smart grid, the system \nmust manage a large amount of data from millions of \nsensors in real time and integrate a diverse set of data \nanalytics and control applications. Given that the \npower grid is a critical piece of infrastructure, the \nsystem also needs to be highly scalable, highly reliable, \nand highly secure. The existing general-purpose \nsystems cannot meet the scalability challenge and \nquality of service guarantees at the same time.  \nWe explore various design options. In particular, \nwe explore the special characteristic of power grid data \nto address these challenges. We have built an initial \nprototype that is designed for integrating both existing \nand emerging power grid technologies. Our design \nconsolidates the capabilities required by both grid \noperations and grid planning applications. This is \nachieved through a layered architecture that bridges \nvarious power applications and their needs to data \naccess. This layered approach allows effective reuse of \nthe mechanisms that we have built to enable fast data \naccess to meet real time requirements. We demonstrate \nthe capability of our system with a diverse set of power \ngrid applications. Our initial results show that we can \nboth meet performance challenges and make it easy to \nintegrate a diverse set of data analytics and control napplications.    \n5.

According to the adaptation mechanisms\npresented in Section IV, the application designer plans to\nmodify the con?guration of the BS task by doubling both\nthe number of CPUs and the amount of memory to a BS?\nvariant, i.e.:\nBS? = ?VM4,4, 1.0?\nAs we assume that in France there are no available VMs\nwhich such features, this task will run in England. So, the\nactions that the application designer takes into account are\nMod\(BS,BS application designer proposes only this\nvariant, the solution of the local optimization \(see Eq. 3 such a variant and all the workload for the ?rst task of\nthe BP is sent to BS?. Indeed, what we would like to demon-\nstrate in this validation is how the enactment of an adaptation\naction can in?uence the values of the monitored metrics. As a\nconsequence, the two alternatives to be considered are XNop\nand XMod.\nAbout the alternative XNop the values for the ?CONop2 ,\n?ENop result 0, since no modi?cation has been done to the\nprocess and this does not affect the energy metrics. About the\nnumber of satis?ed soft constraints, these values are computed\nconsidering the data monitored during the previous execution\nand constraints over the indicators. About CPU usage, only the\n?rst task satis?es the given constraints, while constraints about\nresponse time and throughput at the task level are satis?ed for\nall tasks except for the ?rst one in which response time is\nhigher than the constraint and throughput is lower. At the BP\nlevel, throughput is not satis?ed and the same for application\nperformance.\nThe computation of the values for the alternative XMod\nfollows the application independent and dependent estimation.\nThese estimations are based on the monitoring data associated\nwith previous execution of the tasks composing our BP that,\nas previously said, can be done for other instances in different\nprocesses. The result of this estimation is reported in the third\ncolumn of Table I \(i.e., “Estimation energy\nconsumed by the application requires the knowledge of the\nCPU load. Looking at the data about previous executions, we\nsearch for instances of BS task running on a VM4,4 and\nwe discover that, having the same workload as in the initial\nexecution: \(i and \(ii the remaining tasks. For this reason, following the\nstructure of the BP , we analyze the previous executions to\nestimate the CPU load given the new workload. For instance,\nhaving a BS faster by 20% means that the workload rate\nfor the RO increases of the same amount \(the effect of the\nbranch is considered insigni?cant and looking at the data, we\nunderstand how, under this circumstances, the CPU load for\nthe RO double \(from 20.84% to 41.68 know it is invoked very rarely for which the\nCPU load remains unchanged. For the sake of simplicity these\nestimations are intentionally rough as a real estimation requires\na lot of assumptions and data available to the application\ndesigner. For this reason, in the real scenario, we can assume\nthat such data along with the experience of the designer, will\nresult in a more accurate estimation. Having the CPU load for\neach of the tasks, the computation of the energy consumed by\nthe application follows the assumptions in 8].\nExploiting the Bayesian Network computed starting from\nthe monitored data \(see Fig. 5 number of\nsatis?ed indicators for the CPU loads estimated in column 3\nof Tab.

FINAL REMARKS\nIn this paper we presented an approach for supporting the\nenergy-aware adaptation of business processes at design time\ndriven by an optimization problem that takes into account both\ninfrastructural, applicative, and environmental standpoints. In\nparticular, the adaptation actions available to the application\ndesigner rely on the de?nition of variants for the tasks com-\nposing the business process.\nThis approach is now heavily based on the assumption that\nmonitored data about previous executions are available, and\ninformation able to give the values for the interesting metrics\nare all included in this knowledge base. For future development\nof our approach, we aim to relax this assumption, trying to\nunderstand if we can infer the values of the metrics in case\nthe data needed to compute them analytically are not present.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work has been supported by the ECO2Clouds project\n\(http://eco2clouds.eu activity of the 7th Framework\nProgramme under contract number 318048.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Greenpeace, “How Clean Is Your Cloud?,” tech. rep., 04 2012.\n[2] A.

PARTITIONING SCHEME \nIn this section, we describe some additional details of the \npartitioning schemes. For a given n nodes and P processors, \nwe create P partitions Vo, V1 , . . .  Vp-1 . The processors are \nlabeled as 0, 1 ,  . . .  P - 1. Partition Vi is processed by pro­\ncessor i. For each scheme, we need to know i of nodes in each partition, and iii Below we show how to calculate them for the three \npartitioning schemes. \nA.1 Uniform Consecutive Partitioning UCP assigned to the par­\ntitions. \nPartition size: The sizes of the partitions are almost equal. \nLet B = I f5 l Then, the size of a partition is either B or \nB -1. \nPartition range: Partition i includes the nodes from iB nto \(i  + I III J . \nA.2 Linear Consecutive Partitioning \(LCP par­\ntitions, and the number of nodes in the partitions are mod­\neled by arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d a+\(P- l are partition pal'ame­\nters. At the end of this section, we discuss how a and d are \ndetermined. \nPartition range: Partition i has the nodes from L;:? \(a+ \njd 2a+\(?-1 a + jd i + 1 2a?id 1 .  \nFinding processor rank: Given a node u ,  we need to \nfind the partition i such that u E Vi, Node u satisfies the \nfollowing inequality: \ni-I \nl 2a + \(i - l i + 1 2a id 11 pa­\nrameters a and d are determined using the number of nodes \nn and the number of processors P. Parameter d 


is the slope \nof the straight line y = a + dx, where y represent the num­\nber of nodes in the processor with rank x = i. We calcu­\nlate d by finding two points on this straight line. Putting \ni = 0 and i = P -1 in Eqn 10, we can compute nl and \nnp- l .  Then, the number of nodes in the first processor is \nnl - no = nl and the number of nodes in last processor is \nnp - np- l = n - 1 - np- l .  Hence, we have \nNow, we have \nd = \nn - 1 np- l - nl \nP \n. \nP- l \n2 2a + \(P - l P - l Round Robin Partitioning \n\(12 partitions, the number of nodes is almost \nequal for all partitions. Similar to UCP scheme, the size of \na partition is either I f5 l  or I f5 l  - 1. \nPartition range: For round robin partitioning, partition i \nhas the nodes i, i + P, i + 2P, . . .  i + \(B - l parti­\ntion i is determined by i = u mod P. \nComputation load: The expected number of request mes­\nsages received for node k is \(Hn- 1  - Hk see Lemma 3.4 load \nfor node k is CL\(k Hn- 1  - Hk with partition Vi = {j Ij \nmod P = i} is PL\(i Hn- 1  - Hk + b CL\(k1 k2 i l i2 between the loads of two processors is \nPL\(O P -1 Hn- 1  - Hk + b Hn- 1  - Hk + b kEVp_ l  \nS \(Hn- 1  + b 1 V0 1 - l Vp- 1 1 l i = 0, \nkEVrl kEVp_ l  \nL Hk < L Hk + Hn , \nk EVp_ l  kEVrl \nand thus, PL\(O P -1 log n nOtherwise, \n1 V0 1 - l Vp- 1 1 = 1, \nL Hk S L Hk ,  \nk EVp_ l  k EVo \nand thus, PL\(O P -1 O\(log n

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

Table 2 defmes the telemetry measurement \nsamples per measurement needed to predict mental illness \nfrom each of the different phases that data is generated and \nmade available for processing for completing prognostic \nanalysis during space exploration. This infonnation will be \nused to create a baseline behavior for comparison with \nactual data to discriminate between nonnal and abnormal nbehavior. \nTable 3 is a list of biological diagnostic measurements to be \nincluded in CCSDS telemetry available for ground \npersonnel to complete a prognostic analysis used to predict \nmental illness would be occurring in the near future. In the \nevent that the presence of accelerated aging is identified, \nindicating that mental illness will occur, changes to the \nenvironment to the environment can be made to prevent \nmental illness from occurring. \nTable 3 includes 3 5  measurements are from the circadian \nand ultranian rhythms including the value for the least \nsignificant bit \(LSB into telemetry in the CCSDS format and the \nexpected extreme range that the measurement will need to \nmeasure across and not be exceeded. The LSB value is \nimportant because it defines the smallest increment n\(resolution e.g. knowledge the \nmeasurement. The measurement range is important to defme \nthe 5th or 6th degree polynomial used to convert the 8-bit \ndigital words in telemetry back to analog telemetry so the \ntelemetry processing and display system can accurately \ndisplay the biological and engineering diagnostic \ninformation to ground personnel for analysis. \n1 7  \nTable 3 .

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
