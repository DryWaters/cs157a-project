Map-Based Graph Analysis on MapReduce\nUpa Gupta, Leonidas Fegaras\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington CSE\nArlington, TX 76019\n{upa.gupta,fegaras}@uta.edu\nAbstract—The MapReduce framework has become the de-facto\nframework for large-scale data analysis and data mining. One\nimportant area of data analysis is graph analysis. Many graphs\nof interest, such as the Web graph and Social Networks, are very\nlarge in size with millions of vertices and billions of edges. To\ncope with this vast amount of data, researchers have been using\nthe MapReduce framework to analyse these graphs extensively.\nUnfortunately, most of these graph algorithms are iterative in\nnature, requiring repetitive MapReduce jobs. We introduce a\nnew design pattern for a family of iterative graph algorithms\nfor the MapReduce framework. Our method is to separate the\nimmutable graph topology from the graph analysis results. Each\nMapReduce node participating in the graph analysis task reads\nthe same graph partition at each iteration step, which is made\nlocal to the node, but it also reads all the current analysis\nresults from the distributed ?le system \(DFS local graph partition using a merge-join and\nthe new improved analysis results associated with only the nodes\nin the graph partition are generated and dumped to the DFS.\nOur algorithm requires one MapReduce job for pre-processing\nthe graph and the repetition of one map-based MapReduce job\nfor the actual analysis.\nIndex Terms—MapReduce, Distributed Computing, Graph\nAlgorithms\nI. INTRODUCTION\nRecently, the MapReduce programming model [1] has\nemerged as a popular framework for large-scale data analy-\nsis on the cloud. In particular Hadoop, the most prevalent\nimplementation of this framework, has been used extensively\nby many companies on a very large scale. Many of the data\nbeing generated at a fast rate take the form of massive graphs\ncontaining millions of nodes and billions of edges. One graph\napplication, which was one of the original motivations for the\nMapReduce framework, is page-rank [2], that calculates the\nrelative importance of web pages based on the web graph\ntopology. Analysis of such large graphs is a data intensive\nprocess, which motivates the use of the MapReduce paradigm\nto analyse these graphs.\nThe execution time of a MapReduce job depends on the\ncomputation times of the map and reduce tasks, the disk I/O\ntime, and the communication time for shuf?ing intermediate\ndata between the mappers and reducers. The communication\ntime dominates the computation time and hence, decreasing\nit will greatly improve the ef?ciency of a MapReduce job.\nPrevious work required the whole graph to be shuf?ed to and\nsorted by the reducers, leading to the inef?cient graph analysis.\nThis problem becomes even worse given that the most of these\nalgorithms are iterative in nature, where the computation in\neach iteration depends on the results of the previous iteration.\nTo improve the ef?ciency of graph analysis, some earlier\nwork has been done on reducing the size of the input so\nthat graph partitions are small enough to ?t in the memory\nof a single cluster node. In addition, the Schimmy design\npattern [14] has been introduced to avoid passing the graph\ntopology across the network. Unfortunately, this method still\nrequires the partial results computed for each node to be shuf-\n?ed among the nodes. There is also earlier work on optimizing\niterative MapReduce jobs, such as Twister [3] and HaLoop [4].\nFurthermore, work has been done on implementing graph\nanalysis in other parallel programming paradigms, such as the\nbulk synchronous parallel [5 paradigm, such as Pregel [6] by\nGoogle, and Hama [7] and Giraph [8] by Apache.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new design pattern for a family\nof iterative graph algorithms. Our method is to separate the\nimmutable graph topology from the graph analysis results.\nEach MapReduce node participating in the graph analysis task\nalways reads the same graph partition at each iteration step,\nwhich is made local to the node, but it also reads all the current\nanalysis results from the distributed ?le system \(DFS local graph partition using a\nmerge-join and the new improved analysis results associated\nwith only the nodes in the graph partition are generated and\ndumped to the DFS. Our method requires that the partial\nanalysis results associated with only those nodes that belong\nto the local graph partition be stored in memory, which is\nusually far smaller than the graph partition itself since the\nnumber of nodes is usually far less than the number of edges.\nOur algorithm requires one MapReduce job for preprocessing\nthe graph and the repetition of one map-based MapReduce job\n\(ie, a job without a reduce phase is described as follows: Section II\ngives description of related work. Section III introduces the\nMapReduce model and Section IV describes the previous\ndesign patterns for graph analysis. Sections V describes our\nproposed map-based design pattern for the graph analysis.\nFinally, Section VI evaluates the performance of our graph\nanalysis using various data sets and compares it with the\nSchimmy approach.\nII. RELATED WORK\nThe MapReduce model was ?rst introduced by Google in\n2004 [1]. Several large organizations have implemented this\nmodel including Apache Hadoop [9], Google Sawzall [10],\nand Microsoft Dryad [11]. Hadoop, an open source project\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 24\nFig. 1. An Example of a MapReduce Job Execution\ndeveloped by Apache, is the most popular MapReduce im-\nplementation. It is being used by many companies for data\nanalysis on large scale.\nSince most graph processing algorithms, such 


as breadth-\n?rst-search, are iterative in nature, they require repetitive map-\nreduce jobs. Earlier work [12 13] on graph processing based\non MapReduce used algorithms that read and shuf?e the whole\ngraph among the participating nodes at each iteration step,\nresulting in inef?cient graph analysis.\nWe brie?y describe some related work that addresses the\nproblem of inef?ciency of graph processing in the MapReduce\nframework. Twister 3] and HaLoop [4], as stated before, are\ndeveloped to support iterative computations in the MapReduce\nframework. The main feature of Twister is the long running\nmapper and reducer tasks with a cacheable distributed mem-\nory, which was used to avoid the repeated data loading from\ndisks. Twister is also a stream-based system where the output\nof mappers is directly streamed to reducers. HaLoop caches\nthe loop invariant data structures, thus reducing the cost of\nloading and shuf?ing them in subsequent iterations Neither\nTwister nor HaLoop are scalable, because they both require\nmemory cache for storing and indexing the data, which is\nproportional to the size of data.\nThe Schimmy design pattern [14], introduced by Lin and\nSchatz, uses the notion of the parallel merge join to avoid\nthe shuf?ing of the graph topology in MapReduce but it still\nrequires the shuf?ing of the partial results generated for each\nvertex or edge of the graph. MapReduce was also used to ?lter\ndata and reduce the data size in a distributed fashion [15], so\nthat the data analysis can be done in a single machine. This\nmethod is not applicable to some graph algorithms such as\nthe PageRank, which requires the whole graph topology and\nthe metadata of all vertices to compute the popularity of all\nthe vertices of the graph.\nThere has been a recent development in incremental pro-\ncessing systems, such as Incoop [16], a Hadoop-based in-\ncremental processing system, and Google’s Percolator [17],\nan incremental processing system based on BigTable. These\nsystems target applications that process their data in the form\nof small updates. They do not target general graph processing\nalgorithms.\nAnother programming paradigm for parallel graph process-\ning is the bulk synchronous parallel \(BSP  Google’s Pregel [6], Apache Hama [7], and Apache\nGiraph [8] are systems based on the BSP model. The disad-\nvantage of the BSP model is that it requires that the whole\ngraph be stored in the collective memory of the cluster, which\nlimits the size of graphs that can be analysed.\nIII. MAPREDUCE\nMapReduce is a distributed processing framework that en-\nables data intensive computations. The framework, inspired\nby the functional programming paradigm, has two main com-\nponents, a mapper and a reducer. A mapper works on each\nindividual input record to generate intermediate results, which\nare grouped together based on some key and passed on to\nthe reducers. A reducer works on the group of intermediate\nresults associated with the same key and generates the ?nal\nresult using a result aggregation function. The processing units\nof the MapReduce framework are key-value pairs. An instance\nof the MapReduce framework with 3 mappers and 2 reducers\nis shown in Fig 1.\nDevelopers can develop MapReduce applications by pro-\nviding the implementations for the mapper and the reducer\nmethods. The MapReduce framework handles all the other\naspects of the execution on a cluster. It is responsible for\nscheduling tasks, handling faults and sorting and shuf?ing the\ndata between the mappers and the reducers, where the inter-\nmediate key-value pairs are grouped by key. The MapReduce\nframework works on the top of a distributed ?le system, which\nis responsible for the distribution of the data among all the\nworker nodes of the cluster.\nAfter each mapper ?nishes its task, its intermediate gen-\nerated results are passed to the reducers. a process known as\nshuf?ing. Each reducer is assigned a subset of the intermediate\nkey space, called a partition. To control the assignment of the\nkey-value pairs to reducers, the MapReduce framework uses\na partitioning function. The intermediate values, after being\ngrouped by key, are sorted by the reducers. The sort order can\nbe controlled by a user-de?ned comparator function.\n25\nThe MapReduce framework also allows developers to spec-\nify a function, called the combiner, to improve performance.\nIt is similar to the reducer function but it runs directly on the\noutput of the mapper. The combiner output becomes the input\nto the reducer. As it is an optimization, there is no guarantee\non the number of times it will be called. When there is a large\namount of shuf?ing of data between the map and the reduce\nphases, combiners can be used to aggregate the partial result\nat the map side to reduce the network traf?c.\nIV. GRAPH ALGORITHMS\nA graph is de?ned as G\(V,E from\nvi to vj is represented as the pair of nodes \(vi, vj some information\nassociated with it \(such as, a node label, a page-rank value,\nthe number of out-links, etc and, similarly, each edge may\nhave some information associated with it \(such as, edge label\nand relationship type associated with nodes can\nbe improved at each iteration. Such graph algorithms can be\nformulated as follows:\nrepeat\nfor all vn ? V do\nRn ? Fn\nFn ? f\({Fm|\(vm, vn Ri, Fi nwhere Fn and Fm are the partial results at vertex n and m,\nrespectively, f is a function to compute the partial result for\neach vertex of the graph, ? is the function to compute the\nresult improvement between 


iterations, and ? is the threshold\ndetermining the stopping condition. The algorithm given above\nrepeats until the termination criterion is met.\nPage-Rank, a well-known algorithm for computing the\nimportance of vertices in a graph based on its structure, can be\ncaptured using the above algorithm. It computes the pagerank\nPi for every vertex vi ? V belonging to the graph. Pi is\nthe probability of reaching the vertex vi through a random\nwalk in the graph, which is computed based on the topology\nof the graph. The page-rank computation often includes a\nrandom periodic jump to any other vertex in the graph with a\nprobability 1 ? d, where d is the dumping factor. The page-\nrank of a vertex vi ? V of the graph is calculated iteratively\nas follows:\nPi n1? d\n|V | + d\n?\n\(vj ,vi vj , vm 1 is the\npage-rank of node vj from the previous iteration, and Pi is the\nnew page-rank of the vertex vi. The page-rank equation can be\ncompared to the general iterative algorithm where calculating\nthe page-rank of the vertex vi in a single iteration is the\nfunction f and the page-rank calculated for all the vertices\ncan be seen as a partial result which will be used to calculate\nthe page-rank of all the vertices in the next iteration.\nV. EARLIER WORK\nA. Basic Implementation\nAlthough it can apply to other graph algorithms too we\ndescribe the earlier work on graph analysis based on MapRe-\nduce in terms of the page-rank algorithm. A graph in a\nMapReduce framework is typically represented as a set of\ndirected edges, where each edge is represented as a key-value\npair with the source vertex as the key and the destination\nvertex as the value Each vertex p contains the identi?er of the\nvertex p.id and its meta-data, which includes its current page-\nrank value p.pageRank and the number of outgoing edges\np.numOfOutLinks from the vertex.\nAlgorithm 1 The Mapper for the Basic Implementation of\nPage-Rank\n1: function MAP\(Vertex from, Vertex to from.id from, to to.id, p basic approach of applying MapReduce\nto the graph algorithms described in Section IV. The mapper\nfunction given in Algorithm 1 applies to each key-value pair,\nwith the source vertix serving as a key. It computes the page-\nrank contributions from the source vertex to the destination\nvertex and emits the destination vertex id as the key and its\ncorresponding fraction of page-rank as the value. In addition to\nthe page-rank contributions, the mapper regenerates the graph\nstructure by emitting the source vertex id as the key and the\nwhole edge \(a pair function REDUCE\(ID m, List [p1, . . . , pn   do\n6: if IsPair\(p M.pageRank ? s\n14: for all n ? N do\n15: Emit \(M , n Algorithm 2, gets the page-\nrank contributions from each of the incoming edges to a\nvertex, along with the graph topology associated with the\nvertex. These page-rank contributions are aggregated to get\nthe updated page-rank value of the vertex. The reducer also\nupdates the page-rank value of the source vertex and the\nrevised edge is written back to the disk. This completes an\niteration of the page-rank computation and the output is then\nfed again to the mapper to begin the next iteration. Note that,\nin Algorithm 2, along with the intermediate partial result of the\nvertex M , the set N of all incoming edges to M is also passed.\nThis is necessary in order to preserve the graph topology to be\nused in the next iteration steps. As a result, two types of data\nare being passed from mappers to reducers, one is the partial\ncomputation of the vertex value and the other is the incoming\nedges to the vertex, which passes the topology of the graph\nto the reduce phase Note that this pseudo-code does not take\nthe damping factor and dangling nodes into account.\nB. The Schimmy Implementation\nThe basic implementation of a graph algorithm passes\ntwo types of data from mappers to reducers. One is the\npartial result computed for the vertex and the other is the\ngraph topology itself. After receiving the partial results for a\nvertex and the graph topology associated with it, the reducer\naggregates the partial results and updates the metadata of\nthe nodes. The shuf?ing of the graph structure between the\nmapper and reducer has high overhead, especially in the case\nof iterative algorithms.\nTo address the inef?ciency of the basic implementation, the\nSchimmy design pattern was introduced [14]. The Schimmy\ndesign pattern is based on the concept of the parallel merge\njoin. A merge join between two given relations S and T\nis done by ?rst sorting both relations on their join keys\nand then by simultaneously scanning them, joining the rows\nhaving the same join key. This merge join can be processed\nin parallel by partitioning S and T into small ?les S1, . . . , Sn\nand T1, . . . , Tn, respectively, based on their join key and by\nsorting each partition on the join key. Then, each pair Si/Ti is\nprocessed by a single node that performs a local merge join\nand the node results are combined.\nIn the Schimmy design pattern, the graph G is partitioned\ninto m partitions, so that each reducer Ri is assigned a\ndifferent partition Gi and the edges of each partition are sorted\nby the ID of the source vertex. The reducer Ri works on\nthe intermediate partial results corresponding to the vertices\nin partition Gi and uses a merge-join between these results\nand the partition Gi to calculate 


new improved results for the\nvertices \(Algorithm 3 Schimmy\ndesign does not need to shuf?e the graph structure and hence\nthe mapper remains the same as in Algorithm 1 but without\nline 2. In the reducer \(Algorithm 3 line 2 of the source vertex of the edge, and then advances to the\nAlgorithm 3 The Reducer for the Schimmy Implementation\n1: function INITIALIZE\n2: P.OpenGraphPartition ID m, List p1, . . . , pn  from, to P.Read from, to Emit\(from, to same source vertex.\nOnce an edge is updated, it is written back to the distributed\n?le system.\nIn addition to the design pattern, the Schimmy approach\nintroduced various improvements, such as using a regular\nMapReduce combiner or an in-mapper combiner, which was\nfound to perform better than a regular combiner. For more\ndetails, refer to [14]\nVI. MAP-BASED GRAPH ANALYSIS\nAlthough the Schimmy design pattern improves the ef?-\nciency of graph algorithms by avoiding the shuf?ing and\nsorting the graph topology, it still requires shuf?ing and sorting\nof the partially computed results. To avoid this, we introduce\na map-based design pattern for the analysis of the graph. In\ncontrast to the Schimmy approach, which requires both a map\nand a reduce stage at each iteration of the graph analysis, our\nmethod requires just a map stage. As in the case of Schimmy,\nour method too uses a parallel merge-join. In Schimmy, the\nmerge join happens in the reduce stage between a partition of\nthe graph and the intermediate partial results generated from\nthe mappers. In our case the merge-join is done at the map\nstage between a partition of the graph and a global ?le \(stored\nin DFS contains all the partial results. Figure 2 illustrates\nthis idea.\nMore speci?cally, we perform the graph analysis by doing a\nparallel merge-join between the partition of graph and a global\ntable that contains the partial results associated with all nodes.\nThe graph G is partitioned into G1, . . . , Gm such that edges\nwith the same destination go to the same partition. Also, each\nof the partitions is sorted by the source vertex of the edges.\nA global table in the form of a binary DFS ?le is created that\ncontains the partial results of each node after the end of each\niteration. This ?le is kept sorted by the vertex’s ID. Without\n27\nFig. 2. Page-Rank Computation using Parallel Merge Join\nloss of generality, we describe our graph analysis technique\napplied to the page-rank computation.\nEach mapper Mi reads the same unchanged partition Mi\nand combines it with the global page-rank table using a merge-\njoin between Mi and the entire global table. Each mapper Mi\ngenerates new page-rank values only for those nodes that are\ndestinations of the edges in Gi. Note that no other mapper\nhas edges that have the same destination as those in Gi due\nto the way the graph G is partitioned Thus, each mapper Mi\nis responsible for generating its own subset of the new page-\nrank values Pi, which does not overlap with anyone else’s.\nThis is done by aggregating the incoming contributions from\nthe current page-ranks stored in the global table. As we can\nsee in Algorithm 4, each mapper uses a dictionary D to store\nits own partition Pi of the new page-rank values. The average\nsize of the dictionary D is |V |/m, where V | is the number of\ngraph nodes and m is the number of mappers. Our assumption\nis that D can ?t in the mapper’s memory. To analyze the\ngraph, a merge-join is performed between Gi and the global\ntable during each iteration and the new page-rank values are\naggregated in D, which contains Pi. After Gi is processed,D\nis ushed to DFS and becomes one of the new partitions of\nthe global table.\nThis algorithm is implemented in MapReduce as follows.\nAn initial MapReduce job, which is a pre-processing step,\nis ?rst called to partition the graph based on the destination\nvertex of each edge by using a user-de?ned Partitioner method\n\(which uses uniform hashing on the destination vertex of\nthe edges by using user-de?ned Key Comparator and Grouping\nComparator methods. Once all the partitions are formed, they\nare saved on the distributed ?le system. In addition, each\nreducer node of this MapReduce job generates one partition Pi\nof the global table that contains the initial page-rank values and\nsaves them in a sequence DFS ?le. All these ?les generated\nby the reducer nodes are saved in the same DFS directory,\nthus forming the initial global table.\nThe mapper that evaluates each iteration step is shown in\nAlgorithm 4. It evaluates a merge-join between the graph\npartition Gi \(the mapper input Gi is read sorted by the source of the edges and the\npage-rank table is read sorted by the node. During this join,\nthe mapper aggregates the incoming page-rank contributions\nfor those vertices that are destinations of Gi edges. When\nthe source vertex from of the input vertex has the same\nID as the current vertex n read from the page-rank table, it\nadds a page-rank contribution from the source vertex from to\nthe destination vertex to of the edge. These contributions are\naggregated together and saved in the dictionary D. After the\nentire Gi is processed, this dictionary will contain the updated\npage-ranks of the vertices belonging to that partition 


These\nvalues are sorted and ?ushed out to the disk in a sequence\n?le format to form a single partition Pi of the new global\npage-rank table, which is used by next iteration. The mapper\ndoes not write anything to the disk other than the new page-\nrank values. It should be noted that, to decrease the disk write\noverhead, we set the data replication parameter of the DFS\nsequence ?le that contains the global page-rank table to one,\nso that there is always a single replica of global page-rank\ntable in DFS.\nAlgorithm 4 The Mapper for Map-Based Parallel Merge-Join\nfor Computing Page-Rank\n1: function INITIALIZE  empty\n4: \(n, rank  Vertex from, Vertex to then\n8: D[to] + = rank/from.numOfOutLinks\n9: end if\n10: if from.id ? n then\n11: repeat\n12: \(n, rank P.Read D end function\nVII. EXPERIMENTATION\nTo evaluate the different approaches to implement the page-\nrank algorithm we generate a synthetic graph. These graphs\nare generated by R-MAT algorithm [18] using the parameters\na=0.57 b=0.19 and d=0.5. We used the MRQL system [19] to\ngenerate the synthetic large graph of size 7GB, 14GB and 28\nGB. They contain 500 million, 1 billion and 2 billion edges\nrespectively and all of them have 15 million vertices. The ?le\ngenerated is represented as a ?at list of edges stored in the\ntext format.\n28\nFig. 3 Evaluation of Various Design Patterns on a Synthetic Graph\nThe experimentations are performed on a cluster consist-\ning of 1 frontend server and 17 worker nodes, connected\nthrough a Gigabit Ethernet switch. The cluster is managed\nby Rocks Cluster 6.3 running CentOS-5 Linux. For our\nexperiments, we used Hadoop 1.0.4 distributed by Apache.\nThe cluster frontend was used exclusively as a NameN-\node/JobTracker, while the rest 17 worker nodes were used as\nDataNodes/TaskTrackers. The frontend server and each of the\nworker nodes contain 3.2 Ghz Intel Xeon quad-core CPUs, 4\nGB memory. As each worker machine has 4 cores, there are\ntotal of 68 cores available for map/reduce tasks.\nWe evaluated the ef?ciency of the map-reduce optimizations\nby computing 5 iterations of the page-rank algorithm. We\ncompared the time taken to perform the page-rank iterations\nusing the basic, schimmy and our map-based implementations.\nWe used the range-partitioning method to partition the graph\nfor each of the methods. The computation time for 5 iterations\nof the page-rank algorithm for different graphs is given in\nFigure 3.\nBefore starting the page-rank iterations, the synthetic graph\nis preprocessed to compute metadata information of the ver-\ntices, such as number of outgoing edges from the vertices,\nand to initialize the initial page-rank for each of the vertices.\nFor the basic and schimmy implementations, there is only\none preprocessing step, but for our map-based implementation\nthere are two preprocessing steps: one to compute the metadata\ninformation and the other to initialize the ?rst global table with\ninitial page-rank values for every vertex of the graph.\nOur Map-Based approach improves the performance of\ngraph-analysis over the basic approach as well as the Schimmy\napproach. As our appraoch separates the immutable graph\ntopology from the graph analysis results, there is no shuf?ing\nand sorting phase and hence our approach improves the perfor-\nmance of the graph analysis. There has been an improvement\nof around 10% over the schimmy based approach. It should\nbe noted that our approach is applicable to a general class\nof graph algorithms, as discussed in section IV. It should\nalso be noted that the page-rank is computed for each vertex\nof the graph and hence, it is an exhaustive graph analysis.\nGraph analysis other than page-rank may be less exhaustive\nand hence can bene?t more from our approach.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nGraph analysis in a distributed frameworks, such as Map-\nReduce, is a challenge. There has been approaches for the\nanalysis of graph algorithms, but most of these approaches\nhas a high communication cost because of the shuf?ing and\nsorting phases of the map-reduce. Our approach detaches the\nimmutable graph topology from the analysis and as a result we\nget an improved performance as there is less communication\ncost.\nIX.

Our insights can be\nused to guide future work to focus on application scenarios\nwith the most room for improvement.\nVII. RELATED WORK\nThere have been several studies of MapReduce perfor-\nmance in opportunistic environment, especially in volunteer\ncomputing systems [4], [5], [11], [12]. In order to deliver\nreliable MapReduce service in a highly dynamic environ-\nment, MOON [4], [5] proposes to augment the opportunistic\nMapReduce cluster with a small number of dedicated nodes,\nwhere an adaptive algorithm is proposed for data placement\nand speculative task scheduling under such augmentation.\nAnother thread of research tries to improve performance on\nopportunistic resources by predicting the availability of these\nresources. ADAPT [12] uses the availability history to assign\nan expected availability rate to each new participant of the\nvolunteer computing system. Similar techniques are adopted\nin [11] to select a subset of most available nodes in volunteer\ncomputing systems. All of these works focus on improving\nthe performance of a single job; in contrast, our work focuses\non the fairness among multiple jobs in a shared environment.\nAnother related topic is the scheduling of MapReduce jobs\nin a dedicated environment. In addition to the FIFO, the\nCapacity, and the Fair schedulers in Hadoop release, more\nsophisticated schedulers have been proposed to satisfy various\nperformance requirements, such as LATE [8], Delay [13], DP\n[14], and Corona [15 LATE [8] proposes a more accurate pre-\ndiction of job progress in a \(physically is used together with the analysis of overhead to im-\nprove the scheduling of speculative tasks. A refined version of\nLATE in [13] incorporates delay scheduling and copy-compute\nsplitting to improve data locality and avoid performance issues\nintroduced by LATE. Dynamic Proportional Share Scheduler\n[14] takes into consideration the economic aspect of resource\nallocation by letting users bid for their resources. To 


handle\nthe drastic growth of data in Facebook, Corona [15] introduces\na cluster manager on top of JobTrackers to improve the\nscalability of MapReduce clusters by separating the duties of\nresource management and execution management.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we investigate MapReduce scheduling in\nan opportunistic environment with focus on the fairness\nbetween multiple jobs. We identify several deficiencies of\nthe current fair scheduler, based on which we propose a new\nscheduler that uses the notions of fractional share and map-\nreduce correlation to incorporate dynamic node availability\ninto scheduling decisions. Our implementation in Hadoop\nverifies that the proposed scheduler can improve fairness by\nsignificantly reducing the variability in job completion times,\nachieving up to 50% better fairness in our experiments.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “Amazon EC2 Spot Instances,” aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/.\n[2] J.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
