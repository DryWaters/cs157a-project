INTRODUCTION \nRelying on its features such as elastic service resource \npooling, service on demand, charging for utilities and \nubiquitous accessing[1], cloud computing is rapidly becoming \nthe most popular mode of internet application. More and more \nenterprises and individuals resort their need of data storage and \ncomputing to the clouds. By using plentiful resources in the \nclouds such as storage, computing and web, users can quickly \nget high quality data services and only need to pay a small \nprice. Cloud computing industry has an exciting prospect, but it \nnot only brought the opportunities but also posed challenges to \nthe security of users’ data. For cloud service users, their private \ndata is not stored in local places but stored in the clouds. \nWhere the data is stored, how the data is configured and\nmanaged, how many information they own are known by \nothers etc. these are all transparent to users. The users have lost \nthe direct control over their private data. Data security is one of \nthe most important thing concerns about the popularization of \ncloud computing [2], and it seriously hindered the development \nof cloud computing industry. \nAccess control is a procedure that prohibits other users \naccessing to the data, by granting a part of the users the \npermissions to access to the data stored in the clouds. It is an \nimportant measure to actualize the user data‘s confidentiality \nand protect the user’s privacy. It has very important nsignificance to construct a common, efficient, precise and \nflexible access control model in cloud computing environment. \nThis makes the cloud storage access control has become a \nchallenging research subject. Many scholars have been \nattracted and a lot of fruitful researches have been done. \nII. THREATS TO DATA SECURITY IN THE CLOUDS\nIn cloud computing environment, data is stored in the \nclouds, so the user is no longer in full control of their own \nprivate data. This makes the data stored in the clouds is likely \nto lose its confidentiality under the external and internal threats. \nA. The External Threats \nThe cloud computing users have put a large number of \nsensitive information into the clouds. The quantity of data \nprocessing in the cloud increases every day. These make the \ncloud computing platform become the object that the political \nand commercial frauds attempt to attack. Attackers from the \nnetwork may interact with the cloud system through the \ninterface that the CSP provides to the users. Attackers can \nmake an incursion by using the hardware and software leaks of \nthe cloud computing system. Attackers also may eavesdrop and \nanalyze the user’s data transmitted through the network. \nB. The Internal Threats \nUnder the public cloud mode, the controls of plan making, \nsecurity technology adopting, implementation of security \npolicy and security system operation are entirely in the hands \nof CSP. From the data privacy point of view, the CSP of public \ncloud is not trusted for users. Not entirely trustworthy CSP \nmay embezzle. They may bypass the user application, view \nsensitive user’s data which stored in the clouds directly, reveal \nand sell user’s privacy. \nSome of the attackers know some security vulnerabilities \nexist within the cloud computing system. By using the \nvulnerabilities they can get the privilege and control of the \nsystem and then access to the user’s data. \nIn addition, human error also may lead to leakage of user’s \ndata. \nIII. ACCESS CONTROL AND CLOUD STORAGE \nAccess control originated in the 1960s. At that time, in \norder to manage the accessing to the shared information \nreasonably,  the resource manager presented the level of \nsecurity and security policy to regulate the user to read the \nshared information. Access control is to limit the subject \(user \nor process file or data in order to \nensure that the use of data resource is legal. \n2013 International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data\n978-1-4799-2829-3/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.103\n34030 9 4 31 4\nCloud storage is one of the cloud computing technologies. \nAs a new mode of information storage, cloud storage nassembles a variety of different types of storage devices and \nmakes them work together by using colonies application, grid \ntechnology and distributed file system technology. Cloud \nstorage provides data storage business accessing and other \nfunctions to the users. Users get the storage space and services \nfrom CSP without considering the storage capacity, equipment \ntype, location and data management. The emergence of cloud \ncomputing reduces the hardware and software operation costs \nand maintenance costs for the users. But there are also many \nsecurity problems need to be solved in the current cloud \nstorage services [3,4]. The fundamental goal of cloud storage \nsecurity is to ensure the safety of data stored in the clouds, \nincluding the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data \n[5]. The data user stored in the clouds usually 


contains a large \nnumber of sensitive privacy data, such as patient records, \ncustomer information of enterprise etc. Once these private data \nare leaked, it will cause irreparable loss of economic and other ninfluences to the society, groups and individuals. How to \nprotect the confidentiality of sensitive data and guarantee the \nlegality of users’ accessing to data have become the most \nconcerned problem for the users. As one of the five security \nservices [6], access control has naturally become the key \ntechnique of data privacy protection in cloud storage \nenvironment. CSA \(Cloud Security Alliance facing cloud computing and proposed \ncorresponding solutions including access control [7]. \nIV. CLASSIFICATION AND INTRODUCTION OF\nACCESS CONTROL MODEL IN CLOUD STORAGE \nThe traditional access control model mainly includes DAC \n\(Discretionary Access Control  Mandatory Access \nControl  Role-based Access Control  single domain environment based on \ncentralized control. They are not available in the dynamic, \ndistributed multiple secure domain cloud computing \nenvironment. With the development of cloud computing \ntechnology scholars in related field from domestic and abroad \nhave done a lot of research on access control in cloud ncomputing. They had drawn on the advantages of traditional \naccess control model, and designed some reasonable cloud \nstorage access control models. This section will classify the \nmodels by their core strategies and give introductions to them. \nA. Role Based Access Control Model of Cloud Storage  \nRole based access control ?RBAC?  model was put \nforward for the first time by American National \nStandardization Technical Committee in the 90’s. RBAC \nmodel introduces the concept of role and overcome the \nmanagement defect caused by assigning the access permissions \ndirect to the user in the standard matrix model [11]. RBAC nmodel assigns the access permissions to a role, and assigns \nappropriate roles to users according to the users’ business \nfunction in the organization. Role is the bridge between the \nuser and the access permissions 12]. It separates the user and \naccess permissions logically. The access control procedure is \ndivided into two steps: association of access permissions and \nrole, and association of role and user. R Sandhu et al of George \nMason University in the United States proposed RBAC96 \nmodel [13] in 1996. Because of its systemic introduction for \nRBAC model, it was widely recognized. Soon after R Sandhu \net al proposed the famous ARBAC97 Administrative RBAC  and it changed the \ncentralized management of role definition and role assignment. \nIt realized the hierarchical division of authority management \nand provided a solution for layered function allocation. For its \nadvantages of clear authority management, needless of \nmodifying the users’ permissions one by one in personnel \nadjustment et al, role based access model had been used and \napplied to the dynamic cloud computing environment which \nhas a large number of enterprise customers.  \nLiterature [15] had designed a customizable multi-tenant \naccess control model based on ARBAC by study on the special \nrequirements of access control under multi-tenant mode. Each \nenterprise has their self-governed permission set and role set, \nand also has the authority to assign the roles to the users within \nthe enterprise. And for the enterprise which has a certain scale, \nthe mode of authority management had been changed from \ncentralization to delegation Literature [16] had proposed an \naccess control model based on the extended role of RBAC in \nSaaS \(Software as a Service nhas been added to the model. By analyzing the framework of \ncloud computing, literature [17] divided the user into normal \nuser and resource owner. The user could access to the resource \nby getting the permission from the resource owner. Literature \n[18] had designed the model CCRBAC \(Cloud Computing \nRBAC considered three constraint, they are \ntense, environment and limitation. The attribute and security \nlevel of subject and object were imported into the model, and \nthe modifiability mechanism of subject’s and object’s attribute \nand the subject’s role was provided by the model. The model \nenhanced the flexibility of access control. Literature [19] had \nproposed a flexible access control strategy for cloud storage. \nThe strategy was based on RBAC model and combined with \nthe label of organization and the logical groupings of multiple nsecurity attributes. It had ensured the strong isolation for the \ndata belonged to different enterprise and the appropriate \nisolation for the enterprise internal data. At the same time, the \nconcept of virtual organization was imported to realize the data \nsharing between enterprises, and the concept of interest conflict \nwas imported to restrict the data sharing between competitive \nenterprises. Literature [20] had proposed a dynamic multi-\ndomain access control model based on the risk. In this model \nthe concept of risk was imported into access control, the visit \nlength and the risk level were linked together. Thereby the fine ngrit cross-domain access control has been realized. Literature[6] \nhad proposed a strategy for realizing the identity authentication \nand access control management system which has combined \nSAML, XACML and SPML standard protocols basing on \nRBAC. SAML provided the mechanism of intersystem \nauthentication and license 


information exchange. And realized \nsingle sign on \(SSO realized flexible multi-granularity access control. \nSPML managed the user’s identity and allocated the system nresources automatically. The strategy preferably met the \nrequirements of carrying out identity authentication and access \ncontrol in cloud computing environment. And covered the \nshortage of the cloud storage platforms provided by CSP in \naccess control. Literature [21] had realized a gateway-based \naccess control model basing on RBAC. The model separated \nthe access control strategy for the CSP from the access control \nstrategy for the tenement. The CSP only needed to initialize \nand insulate the tenements. The tenements managed their own \nresources and generated internal access control strategies by \nthemselves. The tenements’ and CSP’s strategies were \ntransparent to each other. It has improved the security of the nstrategies.   \nTask-role-based access control model \(T-RBAC  combined the advantages \nof RBAC and TBAC \(Task based access control  assignment in contextual \nenvironment via task, and graded access control via role. \nLiterature [25] had proposed an access control model based on \nT-RBAC by analyzing the requirements of access control of \ndata in cloud computing. As one of the access subjects in cloud \ncomputing, cloud server got the authority via being authorized \nby the object owner. And it served as a credible intermediary to \ntransmit the access requests in authorization process \nmanagement. This not only made access control do not need to \nrely on the reliability of the CSP absolutely, but also made the \nuser’s burden is not overload reasonable. \nDRBAC \(Distributed Role-based Access Control for \nDynamic Coalition Environments  alliance environment proposed by \nFreudenthal et al. It differed from RBAC model because of its \nthree features: third-party appointment, numerical attribute and \ncertificate reservation. DRBAC combined the advantages of \nRBAC and trust management system. It could not only be \nmanaged flexibly but also implemented dispersedly and \nextendable. In cloud computing environment the data and \nservices were stored in the same cloud, the user of DRBAC \nmodel needed to manage superabundant identity information.\nThat made the requests of cross-domain identity authentication \nquite slow and complex. Literature [27] had proposed the \ncloud-RBAC model that served on cloud computing platform. \nThis model inherited the features of RBAC and DRBAC, and \nhad only one role of administrator. In cloud-RBAC, each user \nhad an cloud-RBAC identity that differed from others’. The \nidentity was a certificate that contained the supplied resources \nbut without domain information. While each role must have \ndomain information, and each domain had a special \nadministrator role to manage internal RBAC. Cloud-RBAC \nhad reduced the data redundancy caused by the superabundant \nidentity information management of cloud platform, lowered \nthe difficulty of access control system, enhanced the nperformance of access control system. \nB. Trust Based Access Control Model of Cloud Storage \nAs a technique that supported distributed authorization and \nmulti-domain authorization, trust management [28-30] \nprovided a new thought of solving the security problems in \ncloud computing environment. Trust management used the ninterpersonal relationship trust model of sociology for \nreference, quantified the complex trust relationship in \ncomputer network by using scientific method, and considered \nall kinds of factors that could impact the trust adequately in the \nprocedure of quantification. Literature [31] had drawn the \nconcept of trust rank into access control model, and proposed a \ntrust based multi-domain access control model in cloud \ncomputing on the basis of trust management and RBAC model, \nby analyzing the features of cloud computing security. This nstrategy built the trust relationship between cloud computing \nplatform and the user by analyzing the user’s actions, and \nworked out the trust rank according to the trust model. When \nauthorized, verifying the facticity of the user’s identity and \nconsidering the credibility of the user’s action were both \nneeded Different access control strategy was adopted when the \nuser access the data of local domain or cross-domain Local \ndomain access control was relate to role assigning, trust \nmanagement and certification authorization While cross-\ndomain access control was relate to role shift, trust \nmanagement and certification authorization. Literature [32] had \nproposed the TBDAC \(Trust-Based Dynamic Access Control trust management and RBAC too. By getting \nlight weight certificate, the user could not only certify its nidentity validity, but also could get the access right via trust \nrank and role information in the certificate. By adopting the \ntrust model based on vector mechanism [33], the literature \nmeasured the trust rank of the entity in two ways: direct trust \nand recommended trust. And the literature had provided the nstrategies of resisting the attacks to direct trust and to \nrecommended trust. \nC. Access Control Model of Cloud Storage Based on\nAttribute-Based Encryption \nThe access control based on ABE \(attribute-based nencryption  not trust the CSP \nabsolutely, the data plaintext could not be exposed on the \nserver. So data encryption and limiting the user’s decryption \nability were needed to implement the access control for \nciphertext. The 


access control based on ABE had used the \nconcept of identity in traditional IBE \(identity-based \nencryption 35] for reference, defined the user’s identity as a \ngroup of attitudes. While the encrypted data was associated \nwith the access control structure. The user could decrypt the \nciphertext unless the attitude group of identity met the access \ncontrol structure. Drawing the access control based on ABE \ninto cloud computing made the requirements of fine grit access \ncontrol and dynamic expansion of massive users in cloud ncomputing were both met.   \nData owner needed to provide the data secret-keys to \nnumerous users. The huge workload made the data owner had \nbecome a bottleneck in access control. To solve this problem, \nwith the premise that the CSP was unbelievable, literature [36] \nhad proposed a CP-ABE \(ciphertext-policy attribute-based \nencryption  Attributes Based Access Control for Cloud Storage of attribute conditions. The user could \ndecrypt the data if satisfied the attribute conditions. The data nowner could manage the access authority by controlling the \nciphertext attributes of the data. This method reduced the cost \nof access authority management to a certain extent. Aiming at \nthe characteristics of cloud storage and the safety issues of data \nsharing, literature [38] had proposed a CP-ABE algorithm \nbased ciphertext access control mechanism. The mechanism \nwas similar to the way that the server dispensed the secret-keys \ncentrally. The secret management of this mechanism was easier \nthan the method that the data owner dispensed the secret-keys \ndirectly. And it was more transparent to the users. Although \nthis mechanism had reduced the complexity of authority \nmanagement and the storage space of access control \ninformation, the performance of the system would be impacted \nby the settings on the attribute conditions in CP-ABE algorithm nOn the basis of ABE, literature [39] had proposed a secret \nsharing scheme algorithm based ciphertext access control \nmethod HCRE. The method moved the re-encryption of secret-\nkey [40] caused by access control strategy change to the cloud, \nthereby the data owner’s cost of re-encryption was reduced and \nthe complexity of authority management was reduced too. \nLiterature [41] had proposed a CP-ABE based ciphertext \naccess control scheme. By introducing the key segmentation \ntechnique and PRE \(Proxy Re-encryption  ntransferred part of re-encryption work to the CSP when the \nuser’s authority was revoked. This reduced the data owner’s\ncomputational cost. Precise access control strategy of multiple \nthreshold was supported by this scheme. And the user’s\nauthority could be revoked not only in terms of attribute group \nbut also in terms of the user belonged to the attribute group. \nLiterature [43] had proposed a attributes based distributed \ncloud access control model. It constructed the access control \nstrategy tree by using the characteristics of KP-ABE key-\npolicy attribute-based encryption  unified \nauthorization party and certified the user’s identity by using the \npublic key infrastructure \(PKI to provide the role’s public key \ncertificate and private key certificate. The author had \ntheoretically analyzed and proved that the model could satisfy \nthe user’s requirement of constituting various access control \nstrategies. And it was proved that the model could resist \ncollusion attack and had the data confidentiality and backward \nand forward secrecy. But no experiment was taken. The \nliterature also had expounded the methods of user revoking and \nstrategy updating. Literature [45] defined and strengthened the naccess control strategies on the theoretical basis of KP-ABE, \nPRE \(Proxy Re-encryption Lazy Re-encryption  interchange between the data \nowner and the data user. It combined with PRE, entrusted the \nheavy key computation task to the cloud server without \nrevealing the content of the underlying files to the cloud server. \nIn order to reduce the computational pressure of the cloud \nserver, the method utilized LRE, allowed the cloud server to \naccumulate the computing tasks of multiple systemic \noperations for batch calculation. On the basis of realization of \nfine-grained access control, the method simultaneously \nguaranteed the scalability, data security and user privacy. \nD. Other Access Control Models of Cloud Storage \nBLP \(Bell-La Padula  mandatory access control model and was used to \nprotect the confidential data by the military. Its idea was to nmark the access subjects and objects with different safety \ngrades. The subject could read the object whose safety grade \nwas lower than the subject and the subject could edit the object \nwhose safety grade was higher than the subject. In this way, the \nsecurity of the data was ensured. Because the data could only \nmove from the entity with lower safety grade to the entity with \nhigher safety grade. Literature [50] had introduced a scheme \nthat was to apply the BLP model to the cloud computing \nenvironment. The CSP stored the clients’ data in the cloud, and \nput the security information and stored information of data on \nthe server. When the user logged in, the login server would \ncheck the user’s validity and define the user’s safety grade. The \nserver would get the security information and operation matrix \ninformation of the data, and compare with the user’s 


security \ninformation. If the user’s operation was permitted, the data’s\nstored information would be given Otherwise the denial of \nservice information would be returned. The literature only \nexpounded the scheme theoretically, and there was no related \nexperiments to verify its feasibility. \nDue to the traditional access control model based on the \nidentities of subject and object was too coarse in data \nprotection, D.E.Denning had proposed the IFC \(Information \nFlow Control  information transmit according to the access rule by \nanalyzing the information flow between the entities This made \nsure the flow of the data in the system was safe. Because the \nauthorization and access control in IFC model were centralized, \nthe model was lack of flexibility and autonomy, and not \nsuitable for such distributed cloud computing platform. So \nMyers et al had proposed a distributed computing environment \nsuited method DIFC \(Decentralized Information Flow Control  strategy \nand authorize independently. Based on DIFC model, literature \n[53] had proposed an access control method DIFC-AC \n\(Decentralized Information Control based Access Control based on the information \nflow. Its core idea was to use tags to mark the security level of \ndata, use the monitor to track data flow, then control the access \nand authorize according to the tags and access control strategy. \nV. PROSPECTS OF FUTURE RESEARCH \n1 in describing the rules of access control. Some of \nthe describing methods have deficiencies, and are unable nto meet the requirements of application. It is necessary to \nstudy and formulate a unified, easy to use articulate and \nhigh executive efficiency method to describe the access \ncontrol rules. \n2 researchers often analyze and evaluate the \nsecurity, computation cost, communication cost et al of the n343\naccess control models based on the experimental data \nobtained from the simulated environment. There is no \nunified and effective mechanism to analyze and evaluate \nthe different access control models. The establishment of a \nunified evaluation model and the development of the \ncorresponding evaluation mechanism are needed urgently. \n3 consumption of the access control \nmodel always exists. Realizing the access control of high \nsecurity in the cloud computing environment with little \ncosts of computation, storage and communication will be \nan aim of the researchers’ ongoing exploration. \n4 different, the global flow of data has been \nimpeded to some extent. How to adopt a unified access \ncontrol method on the international level, ascertain a series \nof international common norms, bring the superiority of ncloud computing mode into full play are worth research. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nThe security issue is the biggest barrier when promote and \napply the cloud computing technologies on a large-scale. Yet \ncloud computing security related researches are still at the \ninitial stage. In cloud computing the users’ data are stored in nthe clouds, the confidentiality of the data is facing great \nchallenge. As the key technology of information security, the \ntechnology of access control is an important mechanism for \nprivacy protection in cloud computing, and it is also an \nimportant approach to avoid the data in the clouds being \nillegally accessed distorted and used. With the popularization \nof cloud computing, people’s attention to the confidentiality of ndata will be continually enhanced, and the researches in this \nfield will get more and more intensive nREFERENCES\n[1] P.

stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
