We extract significant stock movements and collect\nappropriate pre, post and contemporaneous text from social\nmedia sources \(for example, tweets from twitter respective label \(positive or negative predictions for\nlabels of future tweets. We aggregate the net sentiment per each\nday \(amongst other metrics and show that it holds significant\npredictive power for subsequent stock market movement. We\ncreate successful trading strategies based on this system and find\nsignificant returns over other baseline methods.\nI INTRODUCTION\nA well-known behavioral economics hypothesis states that\npublic mood and market performance are correlated. The\nidea being that when people are happy, optimistic, and in\na good mood, they are more likely to increase investment,\nwhich in turn improves stock market performance. However,\nquantification of public mood is not a trivial task. In order\nto build a brute force predictive model that quantifies public\nmood and predicts future market performance, we need to have\naccess to every single individual’s mood and aggregate all\nmoods to estimate the public or collective mood score. Since\nobserving every person’s mood is not possible, a very small\nsample of the population may be used.\nSocial media \(especially Twitter sizable\npopulation sample and also access to user generated and shared\npublicly available content. This content may be mined to learn\nsentiment associated with public mood.\nIn this paper, we use two approaches for mood and senti-\nment detection. The first approach called lexicon-based mood\ndetection, is usually considered as an unsupervised learning\napproach. The lexicon-based approach involves calculating\npresence and counts of chosen words or phrases in the\ndocument. The second approach, which is also our proposed\nmethod, is based on supervised learning. Generally super-\nvised learning gives better results on most problems but is\nimpractical for certain use cases because of lack of labeled\ndata. This is especially true for tweet data. We propose a\nsolution to avoid this problem by extracting automated labels\nfrom the stock market based on good \(for example, significant\nincrease out which days are good or\nbad days for the market. One of the main contributions of\nthis research is to build a training data set for supervised\nlearning of sentiment based on these significant events, that\nis, the times that witness a sharp decline or rise in market\nperformance. Using the collected training data containing\ntweets with positive and negative sentiments, we are able to\nbuild a classifier and predict sentiments of tweets on the fly.\nAggregating the predicted sentiments gives us a sentiment\nscore. Our study shows that the aggregated sentiment score\nhas a decent correlation with the market performance.\nIn general our technique of assigning labels may be used for\nany quantifiable metric like stock price movement, oil prices,\nearnings announcements, or other macro-economic factors like\njob numbers etc. The labels need not be restricted to binary,\nand may be discrete. The time frame for computation of\nreturns can range from intra-day to daily to yearly. The text\nthat needs to be labeled can be either pre-event, post event, or\ncontemporaneous according to the use case.\nThe paper consists of six sections. Following the intro-\nduction, sentiment analysis and public mood detection are\nbriefly reviewed in Section II. The event-based training data\ngeneration for sentiment analysis is discussed in Section\nIII. Section IV provides details for the proposed approach\nand the implementation the supervised model. Experimental\nresults and conclusions are presented in Sections V and VI\nrespectively.\nII. RELATED WORK\nThe main motivation in sentiment analysis is to find out\nwhat other people think[1]. Although sentiment analysis of\nnarrative text is a mature field, learning sentiment from web\ndocuments was initiated about a decade ago. Especially in\nrecent years there is a marked increase in sentiment analysis\non social media such as Twitter and Facebook.\nO’Connor et al. [2] study relations between tweet sentiment\nand public opinion. Public opinions are observed by surveys\nand polling systems. Wilson et al. [3] measure tweet sentiment\nas the ratio of positive and negative words in a tweet obtained\nusing OpinionFinder [4].\n2013 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence \(WI Intelligent Agent Technology \(IAT et al. [5] focus on predicting box office revenue of\nmovies using sentiment from twitter messages. Their main\nhypothesis was that the more a movie is talked about, the more\nlikely it is to be successful at the box office. They performed\nprediction using the following two approaches. \(i mention in a tweet is assumed pos-\nitive. The underlying assumption is that people post positive\ncomments 


about movies way more than they post negative\ncomments. They use this to construct a feature called tweet-\nrate” and use a regression model to perform prediction.\(ii language model.\nGold data was generated using Amazon Mechanical Turk and\nthe prediction was compared with HSX Hollywood Stock\nExchange office success.\nBandari et al. [6] propose a method to predict the popularity\nof news items on the social web For each news article, features\nare generated based on the source of the news story, news\ncategory subjectivity of the news, and named entities men-\ntioned in the news. They apply regression and classification\nalgorithms to predict news popularity based on these features.\nTheir experiments showed that it is possible to estimate ranges\nof popularity with an overall accuracy of 84% considering only\ncontent features.\nIn contrast to [6], Hong et al. [7] predict popularity of recent\nmessages on twitter. They model the problem as a classifica-\ntion problem, and construct features based on message content,\ntemporal information metadata of messages and users, as well\nas the users’ social graph.\nGilbert et al. [8] estimate anxiety, worry and fear from over\n20 million posts on LiveJournal, and find that an increase in\nthese negative expressions predict downward pressure on the\nS&P 500 index. Zhang et al. [9] describe a simple approach to\npredict stock market indicators such as Dow Jones, NASDAQ,\nand S&P 500 by analyzing twitter posts. The authors estimate\ntweet mood based on tweet count of words expressing certain\npre-decided mood \(hope, fear, worry number of followers of\nthe mood, number of re-tweets of the moods, etc.\nBollen et al. [10] also uses twitter mood to predict the stock\nmarket. The sentiment analysis is based on OpinionFinder\n[4] and POMS [11 OpinionFinder assigns a positive or\nnegative polarity to a tweet, while POMS assigns one of the\nfollowing six labels: calm, alert, sure, vital, kind, and happy.\nA time series of mood is constructed using collective tweet\nsentiment per day. Their analysis shows strong correlation\nbetween ‘calm’ mood and DJIA data while others including\nOpinionFinder sentiment shows weak correlation.\nOh et al. [12] forecast future stock price movement with\nmicro blog postings from StockTwits and Yahoo Finance.\nThey constructed multiple sentiment classifiers based on posts\nthat were manually labeled with bullish, bearish, or neutral\nsentiment. The sentiment scores were used to predict the future\ndirection of the stock market. Ruiz et al. [13] use tweets\nabout specific stocks and represent tweets through graphs\nthat capture different aspects of the conversation about those\nstocks. Two groups of features are then defined based on these\ngraphs: activity-based and graph-based features. By studying\nthe relationships between these features and the traded volume\nand price of stocks, they develop a trading strategy that\noutperforms other baseline strategies.\nIn all these approaches for sentiment analysis, either an\nunsupervised method, such as a list of predefined mood words\nis used, or training data are manually generated. We generate\ntraining data automatically to build a sentiment classifier One\nbig advantage of this method is that we can label as much as\ndata we need, and no human labeling efforts are needed at all.\nWith regards to our event-based supervised learning method,\nwe are not aware of any similar effort in assigning labels to\nsocial media text. Perhaps, the closest system to our work is\nthat of Lavrenko et al. [14] in which stock trends were used\nto label selected news stories. The authors chose news stories\nthat were known to be related to each stock. We concentrate\nour efforts on social media text rather than news documents.\nFrom a linguistics perspective, social media text \(also called\nmicro-text inherently different from other types\nof documents. Social media text has much more noise and\nlesser content in each document \(or tweet RE,\nre-tweet, etc. render additional differences. Social media text\nis much more representative of the general public in terms\nof both opinions as well as linguistic quality than those\nwitnessed in news articles written by journalists. While the\namount of content per social media documents might be\nvery less, the scale of social media text is enormous and\ncontinually increasing. This makes it impossible to manually\ncurate training data hence our system is even more important\nin this regard.\nThere are two aspects to the proposed method, \(i learning\nsentiment from relevant labeled text using significant events,\nand \(ii predict future significant\nevents. We discuss learning of sentiment in the next section,\nfollowed by prediction in section IV.\nIII. SUPERVISED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS\nAs discussed in the previous sections, our method takes\nadvantage of supervised learning algorithms while avoiding\nmanually labeling training data. There are two key components\nin learning sentiment: \(i tweets; \(ii Training Data\nGiven a tweet, in order to predict its sentiment, either\nunsupervised or supervised learning may be used. The ben-\nefits of using unsupervised learning is that no human-tagged\ntraining data is needed however, it usually doesn’t perform as\nwell as supervised learning. For supervised learning various\nclassification techniques can be used to model tweet sentiment.\nHowever, it is usually very costly if 


not impossible, to get\nhuman-tagged training data, especially for data the scale of\ntweet data.\n338\nSince in this paper our goal is to predict stock markets, we\nconsider only stock related sentiments. In general, big stock\nprice fluctuations affect people’s mood, and people’s mood\nin turn affects stock market. We therefore assume that when\na stock price goes significantly up relative to overall stock\nmarket \(for example, S&P 500 in general, the tweets related\nwith this stock reflect positive mood; similarly when a stock\nprice goes way down with respect to S&P, the related tweets\nreflect negative mood. Therefore, we can use the stock price\nchanges to label a tweet’s mood.\nApart from using stock returns, other explicit positive\nand negative events may be used to label tweets. Corporate\nEarnings reports are one such type of events that may cause\nsignificant stock price movement. When a company beats\nconsensus estimation of its earning and revenue by a big\nmargin, the sentiment towards the company usually turns\npositive; vise versa. Since historical data of how much a\ncompany beats expectations is available, we can use those\nevents to label tweets. Other events such as merger-and-\nacquisition announcements, macro-economic events such as\nmonthly job reports of US unemployment rate, monetary\npolicy announcements from central banks around the world,\ncan all influence stock markets dramatically, and thus can be\nused to label our data.\nApart from these, some unexpected events can change\npeople’s mood dramatically. For example, when Jamie Dimon,\nCEO of JP Morgan, first announced the two billion loss caused\nby the “London Whale” trades, the sentiment towards the\ncompany turned extremely negative in the next 48 hours.\nThe technical problems that caused the delay of Facebook\nIPO played a big role in affecting people’s sentiment towards\nFacebook stock and IPO in general.\nWhen we label a tweet based on the clues mentioned before,\na positive label means at the moment when the user posts\nthe tweet, the sentiment is positive. We could label tweets\nwith temporal sentiment, such as whether a user expects,\nexperiences, or recalls positive/negative sentiment. We could\nalso use different time frames for computation of returns for\nexample, intra-day, daily, monthly, or yearly. Depending on\nthe use case, the assigned text can be either text that was\ngenerated pre-event, contemporaneously, or post-event.\nIn the experiments reported in this paper, we label each\ntweet based on daily events. Let to and tc be the opening\nand closing time of a particular stock, or index, Si. Here,\ntc ? to = 8hrs are the official market operation hours. Let\nrsp be the return for S&P 500 and F \(to tc of\ntime as a gain event if\n\(F \(tc to to 1 loss event if\n\(F \(tc to to 2 criteria are\nignored. When observing a gain event, all tweets mentioning\nthe stock Si on that day are collected and labeled as positive\ntweets. Similarly, all tweets collected during a loss event are\nlabeled as negative tweets. If a stock has more than one gain\nor loss event, all of them are considered. Using this process,\na set of positive and negative examples are generated and we\nare able to implement a supervised model to learn about the\nsentiment of unknown tweets.\nB. Sentiment Classifiers\nHaving both positive and negative examples, we implement\ntwo types of classifiers. The first classifier uses heuristic\nfeatures from our mood word list such as “happy”, “hope”,\n“sad”, and “disappointed”. We use an extended list of mood\nwords that includes over one hundred mood words and their\nderivations. Every tweet is represented by a feature vector with\nthe same size of mood word list. If mood word i in the list\noccurs in the tweet, the corresponding feature in the vector\nturns on \(one zero engineering task is\nperformed to select positive features associated with positive\ntweets and negative features associated with negative tweets.\nIn many cases, training data is unbalanced \(many positive\nexamples vs. few negative examples and vice versa technique\nat feature level instead of data is employed. In other words, if\nthe number of positive examples is 50% of negative data, in\nthe final feature vector, the number of positive features will be\ntwo times bigger than the number of negative examples. With\nthis strategy, we let minorities have more representative data\nin the training process.\nIn addition to the positive/negative features, we also use\nfeatures based on the metadata associated with each tweet,\nincluding the existence of hashtags, stock ticker symbols,\nURLs, and re-tweets \(RT classifier using the mood word list as the\nbaseline classifier and the second one is called the sentiment\nclassifier. Although the positive and negative features are not\nnecessarily sentiment words \(such as the word “treasury market.\nFor both feature vectors, a Rocchio classifier[15], which is\nsimple yet effective in text classification tasks, is employed.\nBoth classifiers offer precision and recall over 90%. Sentiment\nclassifier offers slightly better results as given in Table I.\nThe precision and recall are estimated using 10-fold cross\nvalidation over training data.\nHowever, the true test is to realistically evaluate how indica-\ntive the 


approach is in predicting future stock price direction,\nthe eventual aim of the process. In section IV, we provide\nexperiment results for these two approaches and test how they\nfair individually and against each other.\nIV. PREDICTION ALGORITHM\nIn the previous sections, we discussed the learning of\nsentiment using significant events. In this section, we discuss\n339\nAlgorithm 1 Stock market prediction using event-based su-\npervised sentiment learning\nChoose the significant event criteria.\nChoose appropriate pre/post/contemporaneous tweets based\non the chosen significant event criteria.\nAssign an appropriate label for each tweet based on its\nassociated event \(for example, positive for rise or negative\nfor fall classifier on the labeled tweets.\nPredict sentiment of new future tweets.\nAggregate tweet sentiments.\nTake a long/short position based on the net aggregated\nsentiment.\nprediction of sentiment for future tweets. Below we summa-\nrize the necessary steps in the proposed algorithm:\nAs mentioned previously, significant events can be defined\nbased on the specific use case. We chose significant stock\nmovement compared to the S&P 500 as the event criterion.\nFor the training data, text/tweets that were generated pre-\nevent/post-event/comtemporaneously may be collected and as-\nsigned labels. In the results reported in this paper, we collected\nand used all of them. We assigned binary labels, positive or\nnegative, to tweets Labeling need not be restricted to a binary\nset, any granularity or number of classes may be used. Also,\nthe problem need not be modeled as a classification problem,\nregression may be used. The underlying model should be\nused to predict the label \(or sentiment used to make a\nprediction for stock market. The idea being that the system\nwould learn the sentiment of tweets before significant positive\nand negative events. Once this sentiment \(or pattern in general in the tweets, it would be indicative of future\nstock market performance.\nA. Descriptive Statistics about the Datasets\nWe collected tweets for all stock constituents of DJI30 index\nfrom 27th March to 13th July 2012 using Twitter’s Search\nAPI. The Search API returns all recent tweets that include\nthe search query. We manually curated a query list in which\nwe included all the terms that are used to refer to a company\non Twitter. For example, for Apple Inc. our search query was\n“Apple Inc OR AAPL OR #AAPL OR $AAPL OR AAPL”.\nThis may not be foolproof, but the idea is to look at aggregated\nsentiment from tweets and hence some noise should not have\na significant impact on the results. Since the Search API only\nreturns a recent history, we ran a cron job every 15 minutes that\niteratively searched and stored all unique tweets in a database.\nTweets returned by the Search API have unique identifiers and\nhence are easily distinguishable. This led to a total collection\nof about 30 million tweets. The distribution of tweets across\ncompanies is not uniform with some companies being far more\npopular than others in the index. For example, ‘Apple Inc.’ is\nfar more popular than ‘The Travelers Company’.\nAfter training on the tweets that satisfies the significant\nTABLE I\nAVERAGE PRECISION, RECALL, AND F-MEASURE OF THE SENTIMENT\nCLASSIFIER.\nMood words \(Baseline 1.00\nF-measure 0.91 0.96\nevent criteria according to equations \(1 2 2 million tweets. The classifier also\ngenerated a confidence score for each predicted label. The\nconfidence probability across all tweets ranged from 0 to 1\nwith a median of 1 and mean of 0.9472. We eliminated tweets\nwith a confidence score of less than 0.80 which removed about\n7% of tweets. We found that the removal of this set does not\nhave any significant impact on the results.\nThe proposed approach for generating training data for sen-\ntiment analysis is evaluated using two methods: internal and\nexternal. The internal method employs a traditional classifier\nevaluation approach. A good classification accuracy shows that\nlabels have consistent distinguishing textual patterns learnt by\nthe classifier. This is indeed necessary but not sufficient. The\nexternal evaluation tests whether these have predictive power\nor not. The predicted labels should be able to predict the events\nthat were used for initial labeling. If reasonable predictive\npower is seen, then this can be exploited to learn characteristics\nof any event of interest, in our case stock market performance.\nB. Internal Evaluation of Sentiment Classifier\nSimilar to traditional classifier evaluation procedure, the\nlabeled tweets are divided into training and test data. The\nclassifier is trained on training data and evaluated on test data.\nUsing 20 times 10-fold cross validation, average precision,\nrecall, and F-measure are estimated. Table I illustrates the\nresult of internal evaluation, which is quite promising.\nAs seen both classifiers have reasonable accuracies, with\nthe sentiment classifier outperforming the baseline classifier.\nNext, we perform an external evaluation to test for predictive\npower.\nV. EXPERIMENT RESULTS FOR STOCK MARKET\nPREDICTION\nIn this section, we give our results for testing the aggregated\nsentiment as a predictor of the S&P 500 index. We obtained\nthe daily prices for S&P 500 and computed daily returns\nas close/open? 1. Since we want to predict next day’s\nperformance, we aligned tweets with the next trading day’s\nreturns. We adjusted the trading day for weekends and other\nholidays.\nA. Quality of feature\nWe begin by testing the stock performance predictive quality\nof sentiment as a feature. Such a test can be performed 


using\nthe standard bucketing procedure. We computed mean positive\nand mean negative sentiment for each day. We computed\nnet sentiment as PositiveSentiment?NegativeSentiment\n340\n?0.010\n?0.005\n0.000\n0.005\n0.010\n?0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15\nSentiment\nS&\nP \n50\n0 \nda\nily\n re\ntu\nrn\nNet Sentiment and returns\nFig. 1. This graph shows the mean returns obtained per net sentiment decile.\nAs seen, when net sentiment is extremely negative, the returns are lesser and\nfor extreme positive, the net returns are significantly positive.\nand divided it into deciles Figure 1 shows the mean return\nobtained for its respective sentiment decile. As seen, when net\nsentiment is extremely negative, the returns are lesser and for\nextreme positive, the net returns are significantly positive. This\nbuilds the intuition that the feature certainly holds predictive\npower around extreme sentiment regions. Around the net\nzero sentiment \(or neutral other factors that might be at play. This is\ninline with our expectations.\nOne key issue that arises is that of aggregation of tweet\nsentiment. Tweet sentiment can be aggregated using different\nfunctions as well as different filters. We tested aggregated\nsentiment as a predictor for the S&P 500 index. We also\ntested aggregated sentiment as a predictor of individual stock\nperformance.\nB. Aggregation over entire day\nFigure 2 shows the results for a simple directional trad-\ning strategy that takes a long position on the index if the\nprevious day’s sentiment is net positive and a short position\nif the previous day’s net sentiment is negative. The results\nshow that both the approaches are good predictors of next\nday’s direction. Both the approaches are more profitable than\nholding the index. However, the supervised learning approach\ngenerates significantly higher returns over the lexicon based\napproach. Hence it is clear that there is some predictive power\nin the learnt sentiment.\nBased on our different data analysis steps, we observed\nthat the twitter sentiment time series has autocorrelation,\nwhich seems reasonable considering human emotions may be\ndependent on recent past human emotions. We created the\nfollowing autoregressive model to account for this historical\ndependence.\nSPXreturn\(1 1 2 3 3 0 0 0 SPXreturn\(?1 2 predicted direction\nDate\nR\net\nur\nn\n0.\n90\n1.\n00\n1.\n10\nR\net\nur\nn\nEvent\nLexicon\nS&P 500\nFig. 2. Pnl \(Profit and Loss day’s net sentiment\nwas positive, we went long the SPY 500 the next trading day \(adjusted for\nholidays vise versa. As seen in the graphs, while both strategies are good\npredictors of the S&P direction, the supervised learning approach outperforms\nthe lexicon approach.\nIn equation \(3 t daily arithmetic\nreturn, defined as \(open/close -1 where the day is denoted as\nday 0. t = ?1 implies 1 trading day before day 0. pos\(t positivity of the twitter series on day\nt. neg\(t class\(t pos\(t t intercept.\nOn each day, a training set of last ten days of such data\nis calculated and regressed upon. A prediction is then using\nthe fit obtained for the next days return. Figure 3 shows the\nresults. As seen in the graphs, both the strategies give better\nperformance than a simple one day strategy, and the proposed\nmethod performs significantly better than the lexicon-based\napproach. Of course both strategies are better than holding\nthe SPX even after reasonable trading costs may be removed.\nHence, training on recent historical data gave us better returns.\nNote that the trading strategy based on the proposed method\ngives about 15% returns in about a four month period.\n1 per day and went long the\nnext day on the stocks with sentiment more positive than\nthe moving mean sentiment Similarly, on the next trading\nday, we shorted the stocks with sentiment lesser than the\nmoving mean sentiment. Figure 4 shows the returns of both\nthe event-based and lexicon-based approach. Both approaches\noutperform the index, but as seen the event-based approach\nhas more consistent returns and a higher Sharpe ratio. When\ntwo strategies give similar performance, the strategy with the\nhigher Sharpe ratio is much more favorable because of the\nlower risk \(or variability in returns event based method has a significantly higher\nSharpe ratio because of the consistent uptrend.\n341\nApr 12 2012 May 21 2012 Jun 25 2012\n0.\n95\n1.\n05\n1.\n15\nPortfolio return\nDate\nR\net\nur\nn\n0.\n95\n1.\n05\n1.\n15 Event\nLexicon\nS&P 500\nFig. 3.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nWe proposed a novel method for estimating sentiment based\non 


twitter posts and use the sentiment to predict future stock\nmarket movement. Specifically, we automatically generate\ntraining data based on events related with stock markets. With\nsuch training data, we are able to build a high-precision and\nefficient classifier to assess tweet sentiment and use such\ninformation to build an effective trading strategy. Our trading\nstrategy is able to beat S&P 500 by about 20% returns in four\nmonths.\nThe fundamental point is that we use obvious clues \(for\nexample, significant market events can be easily and\nautomatically detected to get enough training data. Then we\nbuild a model to learn patterns from such data, in order to\nidentify obscure clues \(for example, hidden factors that affect\nstock prices Thus, our method is flexible enough to be used\nin other applications.\nHowever, there is still room to improve the precision, for\nexample, by employing more sophisticated classifiers, which\nis one of our objectives in future work. For an external\nevaluation, the ideal approach would be a domain transfer test\nusing test data from a different domain, for example, movie\nrating or product reviews. However, this needs labeled test\ndata which was not available in this research. However, we\nwill investigate this approach as well in our future work.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors wish to thank Hemali Majithia, Thomson\nReuters R&D for her support in collecting the tweets.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Evolutionary game modeling can derive sustainable or survivable strategies \(mapped from the ESS in EGT such as node failures such as security compromise level modeling in the so-called three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008a this article  v offer an integrated architecture that unite reliability survivability, and fault tolerance, and the modeling approaches with survival analysis and evolutionary game theory implement this architecture. Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
