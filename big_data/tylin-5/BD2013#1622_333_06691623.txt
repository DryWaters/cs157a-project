A Hypergraph-Partitioned Vertex Programming Approach\nfor Large-scale Consensus Optimization\nHui Miao Xiangyang Liu†, Bert Huang?, Lise Getoor?\n?Dept. of Computer Science, †Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park, USA\n{hui, bert, getoor}@cs.umd.edu xyliu@umd.edu†\nAbstract—In modern data science problems, techniques for\nextracting value from big data require performing large-scale\noptimization over heterogenous, irregularly structured data.\nMuch of this data is best represented as multi-relational graphs,\nmaking vertex-programming abstractions such as those of\nPregel and GraphLab ideal ?ts for modern large-scale data\nanalysis. In this paper, we describe a vertex-programming\nimplementation of a popular consensus optimization tech-\nnique known as the alternating direction method of multipliers\n\(ADMM  complex objectives such as inference in rich\nprobabilistic models. We also introduce a novel hypergraph\npartitioning technique that improves over the state-of-the-art\nvertex programming framework and signi?cantly reduces the\ncommunication cost by reducing the number of replicated\nnodes by an order of magnitude. We implement our algorithm\nin GraphLab and measure scaling performance on a variety\nof realistic bipartite graphs and a large synthetic voter-opinion\nanalysis application. We show a 50% improvement in running\ntime over the current GraphLab partitioning scheme.\nKeywords-consensus optimization; large-scale optimization;\npartitioning methods; vertex programming;\nI. INTRODUCTION\nLarge-scale data often contains noise statistical depen-\ndencies, and complex structure. To extract value from such\ndata, we need both ?exible expressive models and scalable\nalgorithms to perform reasoning over the data. In this paper,\nwe show how a general class of distributed optimization\ntechniques can be implemented ef?ciently on graph-parallel\nabstraction frameworks.\nConsensus optimization using alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers \(ADMM  dual optimization problem is decomposed into simple\nsubproblems to be solved in parallel. The combination of\nthe decomposition and the fast convergence of the method\nof multipliers makes it suitable for many problems such as\ninference in graphical models [2], [3] and popular machine\nlearning algorithms [4], [5].\nVertex programming is an ef?cient graph-parallel ab-\nstraction for distributed graph computation. Pregel [6 and\nGraphLab [7] are recently proposed frameworks for par-\nallelizing graph-intensive computation. These frameworks\nadopt a vertex-centric model to de?ne independent programs\non each vertex. Experiments show they outperform the\nMapReduce abstraction by one to two orders of magnitude\nin machine learning and data mining algorithms [8].\nIn this paper, we ?rst investigate the bipartite topology\nof general ADMM-based consensus optimization, present\nits vertex-programming formulation, and develop a scalable,\nparallel algorithm Previously, Boyd et al. [1] discussed\nthe MapReduce implementation of ADMM with a single\nglobal consensus variable node, which is a special case\nof our setup. Secondly, we propose a novel partitioning\nscheme that uses the characteristics of the computation\ngraph and a hypergraph interpretation of the bipartite data\ngraph Our partitioning can reduce the number of replicated\nvertices by an order of magnitude over the current GraphLab\npartitioning scheme [7], reducing communication cost ac-\ncordingly, and halving the running time. Our partitioning\nstrategy is of independent interest in vertex-programming\nalgorithm design, since it can be used for any problem\nthat decomposes into a bipartite computation graph, such\nas belief propagation in factor-graphs.\nII. MOTIVATION\nBefore describing our proposed algorithm \(Section IV illustrative example of the kind of\nproblems that can be solved using ADMM. We consider\nthe task of analyzing voting preferences of individuals\nconnected by various relationships in a social network. The\nproblem can be cast as a probabilistic inference problem, and\nthe approach that we take here is to de?ne the model using\nprobabilistic soft logic \(PSL  probabilistic models over\ncontinuous random variables using weighted logical rules.\nA PSL program consists of a set of logical rules with con-\njunctive bodies and disjunctive heads \(negations allowed with non-negative weights. The program\nin Fig. 1 encodes a simple model to predict voter behavior\nusing information about a voter \(registration indicating\nvarious social relationships, such as FRIEND and SPOUSE.\n2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 563\n0.5: REGISTEREDAS\(A, P A,P A, P FRIEND\(B, A B,P A, P B, A B,P A, P B, A VOTES\(B,P A, P B, A B,P A, P B, A VOTES\(B,P Additionally, the VOTES predicate is constrained to have total\ntruth value of 1.0, to preserve mutual exclusivity of voting preference.\nConsider any constants for persons, a and b and party p\ninstantiating logical terms A, B, and P respectively. The\n?rst rule encodes the correlation between voter registration\nand 


party preferences, which tend to be aligned but are not\nalways. The next rule states that if a is a friend of b and\nvotes for party p, there is a chance that b votes for party p\nas well, and the second rule makes the same statement for\nspouses. The rule weights indicate that spouses are more\nlikely to vote for the same party than friends. The resulting\nprobabilistic model will combine all of these in?uences\nand include the implied structured dependencies. PSL can\nalso include constraints on logical atoms, such as mutual\nexclusivity of voting preferences VOTES.\nThe engine behind PSL compiles the logical program into\na continuous-variable representation known as a hinge-loss\nMarkov random ?eld \(HL-MRF   models, inference in HL-MRFs can be\ndistributed and solved using consensus optimization. In HL-\nMRFs inference of the most-probable explanation \(MPE particularly\nwell-suited for consensus optimization. We defer to previous\npapers for the mathematical formalisms of HL-MRFs, and\nhere mainly discuss the general ADMM-based consensus\noptimization, which has many applications beyond PSL.\nIII. PRELIMINARIES\nA. ADMM-Based Consensus Optimization\nConsensus optimization simpli?es the solution of a global\nobjective by decomposing a complex objective into simpler\nsubproblems over local copies of the variables and con-\nstraining each local copy to be equal to a global consensus\nvariable The general form of the consensus optimization is\nmin\nx1,...,xN\nN?\ni=1\n?i\(xi 2, ..., N,\nwhere xi with dimension ni is the local variable vector on\nwhich the ith subproblem depends and ?i is the objective\nfunction for the ith subproblem. Let Xi denote the global\nconsensus variable vector that local variable xi should equal.\nRelaxing the global equality constraints by the augmented\nLagrangian [1], the ADMM-based solution becomes:\nxk+1i ? argmin\nxi\n\(\n?i\(xi ki + ?\n\(\nxk+1i ? Xi\nk\n i,j xi iteration,Nl is the number\nof local copies of the lth entry of global consensus variable,\n?i is the vector of Lagrange multipliers for ith subproblem,\nM\(i, j of local variable xi, Xl denotes the lth entry of\nglobal consensus variable, and ? is a step size parameter The\nupdate of Xk+1 can be viewed as averaging local copies in\nsubproblems. Throughout the remainder of the paper, we\nrefer to ADMM-based consensus optimization as ACO.\nThe above equation shows that each of the subproblems\ncan be solved independently. This general form of consensus\noptimization de?nes a bipartite structure G\(S,C,E C represents the set of consensus\nvariable entries, and E expresses the dependencies. Each\nsubproblem ?i\(xi is connected to its dependent consensus\nvariables, while each consensus variable Xj is connected\nto subproblems containing its local copies. This bipartite\ndependency graph makes ADMM computation well-suited\nfor vertex-processing parallelization.\nB. Vertex Programming Frameworks\nRecent development of vertex programming frameworks,\nsuch as Pregel [6] and GraphLab [8], are aimed at improving\nthe scalability of graph processing. Vertex-centric models\nexecute user-de?ned functions on each vertex independently\nand de?ne the order of execution of vertices. Pregel and\nGraphLab have superior computational performance over\nMapReduce for many data mining and machine learning\nalgorithms, such as belief propagation, Gibbs sampling,\nand PageRank 6], [8]. In this paper, we implement our\nsynchronous vertex programs in GraphLab.\nGonzalez et al. [7] propose the gather-apply-scatter \(GAS frameworks. In the vertex programming\nsetting, the user de?nes a data graph with data structures\nrepresenting vertices, edges, and messages. The user pro-\nvides a vertex program associated with each vertex. The\nGAS model abstracts the program into three conceptual\nphases of execution on each vertex. In the gather phase,\neach vertex is able to aggregate neighborhood information,\nwhich can be pushed or pulled from adjacent nodes The\naggregation during this phase is user-de?ned, but must be\ncommutative and associative. In the apply phase each vertex\ncan use its aggregated value to update its own associated\ndata. Finally in the scatter phase, each vertex either sends\nmessages to its neighbors or updates other vertices or edges\nin its neighborhood via global state variables.\n564\nIV. DISTRIBUTED ADMM-BASED CONSENSUS\nOPTIMIZATION IMPLEMENTATION \(ACO implement a graph algorithm using vertex\nprogramming, one needs to de?ne the data graph structure\nand a vertex program that de?nes the computation.\nA. Data Graph and Data Types\nIn ADMM-based consensus optimization, the computa-\ntion graph is based on the dependencies between subprob-\nlems and consensus variables in the bipartite dependency\ngraph G\(S,C,E local variables that only\nappear in one subproblem do not need consensus nodes.\nWe use different data types for subproblem vertices and\nconsensus-variable vertices, denoted sub and con, respec-\ntively. For each subproblem vertex vi ? S, we maintain\nthe involved local variables in xi and associated Lagrange\nmultiplier i, both of which are ni dimension vectors. Each\nvi ? S also stores a vector Xi of dimensionality |Evi for\nholding the dependent consensus variable values. For each\nconsensus variable vj ? C, we only store its 


current value.\nB. ACO Vertex Program\nWe use the GAS abstraction introduced in Section III-B\nto describe our ADMM-based consensus optimization im-\nplementation, ACO, shown in Alg. 1. In each iteration,\nwe de?ne a temporary consensus-variable key-value table\nconsensus_var, where the key is a consensus variable’s\nglobal unique ID, i.e., consensus_var[id\( X the sum of each local copy of a consensus variable.\nAs shown in Alg. 1, in the gather, apply and scatter stages,\nwe alternate computation on the subproblem nodes S and\nthe consensus nodes C. We describe the computation for\neach type and the termination condition below.\n1 ACO Algorithm\n2 // gather neighbor information\n3 gather\(vi, \(vi, vj vj . Xj local_copy_sum + = vj .xkj [id\(vi. Xi vi, sum_result consensus_var new value, solve\nobjective, update multiplier\n11 if vi.type == sub\n12 vi. Xi ? consensus_var\n13 vi.xi ? argminxi\(?i\(xi vi.xi ? vi. Xi average the sum of each local copy\n16 else\n17 vi. Xi ? local_copy_sum/degree\(vi neighborhood\n19 scatter\(vi, \(vi, vj sub\n22 notify\(vj convergence_check vj program for ADMM-based Consensus\nOptimization on vertex vi at iteration k + 1\n1 gather phase of the \(k+1 the kth iteration in its neighborhood.\nWe store each consensus variable in the key-value table\nconsensus_var The commutative and associative aggre-\ngation function combines the key-value tables. We use it to\nsolve the optimization in subproblem in line 13, and the xi\nvector is updated to the solution. Note that the subproblem\nsolver is application-speci?c. In the scatter, the subproblem\nalways noti?es dependent consensus nodes.\n2 sum of all\nlocal copies from the subproblem nodes in the gather phase,\nthen updates itself with the average in the apply phase. In the\nscatter phase, convergence conditions are used to determine\nwhether related subproblems need to be run again.\n3 global primal and dual residual of all\nconsensus variables and their local copies. At the superstep,\nan aggregator can be used to calculate residuals across\nall consensus variables. If both primal and dual residuals\nare small enough, then we reach global convergence and\nthe program stops. If not, all subproblems are scheduled\nagain in the next iteration. However, this global convergence\ncriterion has two disadvantages rst, the use of aggrega-\ntor brings overhead as it needs to aggregate information\nfrom all machines; second some consensus variables and\ncorresponding local copies do not change much and the\nsubproblem counterparts are still scheduled to run, getting\nthe same solution, thus wasting computation resources.\nInstead, our proposed convergence criterion measures\nlocal convergence. In this local criterion, each consensus\nvertex calculates both primal and dual residuals using its\ndependent local copies only; if both of them are small, it\ndoes not notify connected subproblem nodes to run in the\nnext iteration. For a particular subproblem node, if none of\nthe connected consensus variables noti?es it, it skips the next\niteration, thus saving computation. A skipped subproblem\nnode will run again if some dependent consensus variable\nis updated and the local convergence criterion is not met.\nV. HYPERGRAPH PARTITIONING\nNext we introduce a novel hypergraph-based partitioning\nscheme \(HYPER GraphLab’s PowerGraph\n[7]. The primary factors for ef?cient implementation of\n565\ndistributed graph algorithms are load balancing and com-\nmunication cost. Vertex programming frameworks optimize\nthese by distributing data according to balanced p-way cuts\nof their graphs. In our work, we use a vertex-cut formulation\nin the same manner as GraphLab, which has been shown to\nproduce lower communication overhead than Pregel’s hash-\nbased random edge-cut strategy [7], [10].\nA. Problem De?nition and Notation\nLet G\(V,E imbalance parameter.\nFor any v ? V , let A\(v Then the balanced p-way vertex\ncut problem for M machines is de?ned as\nmin\nA\n1\n|V |\n?\nv?V\n|A\(v e ? E|A\(e 1 factor, and the constraint corresponds to a limit\non the edges that can be assigned to any one machine.\nB Intuition and Partitioning in State-of-the-Art Framework\nThe current best strategy used in GraphLab is a sequen-\ntial greedy heuristic algorithm [7], which we refer to as\nGREEDY. Multiple machines process sets of edges one by\none and place each of them into a machine, where the\nplacement A\(v machines.\nWhen a machine places an edge \(u, v u A\(v u, v u v is not ?, say A\(u u, v u u v u, v one of the machines in the\nintersection; the last case is both A\(u v u v 


then \(u, v this GREEDY strategy does not work well\nwith bipartite ACO graphs. In ACO and other similar problem\nstructures, subproblem nodes tend to have much lower\ndegree than consensus nodes. Because the last heuristic in\nthe greedy scheme is biased to large degree nodes, GREEDY\ntends to place subproblem nodes onto different machines. On\nthe other hand, in practice, large-scale ACO involves millions\nof consensus variables so computing a high-quality parti-\ntioning is more important than fast sequential partitioning.\nOnce partitioned, the same topology may be reused multiple\ntimes, for example when performing parameter optimization.\nC. Hypergraph-based Partition for ACO\nA large-scale ACO bipartite graph G\(S,C,E properties which do not ?t well with the greedy heuris-\ntics. a much\nmore expensive than the simple averaging in consensus\nvaraible vc ? C. Thus cutting a subproblem vertex into\nmultiple machines results in solving the subproblem opti-\nmization multiple times; b variable degree\nfollows a power-law degree distribution, while subproblem\ndegree distribution is centered around some small number;\nand c distributions are common when\nvariables involved in subproblems correspond to objects in\nthe real world especially for applications on social and\nnatural networks. On the other hand, due to the utility of the\nADMM decomposition, the original optimization problem\ndecomposes into small subproblems that are each easy to\nsolve, thus the degree of each subproblem node is small.\nThese properties of the bipartite ACO graph motivate us to\nsplit only the consensus variables C instead of partitioning\nover the whole set S ? C, to avoid solving subproblems\nrepeatedly and also to reduce the problem size.\nCutting C with the balanced edge placement constraint\nin G\(S,C,E constraint in\nthe hypergraph H\(VS , EC represents\nthe set of all related subproblems of a consensus variable.\nHypergraph partitioning is a well-studied area and there are\nef?cient packages avialable, e.g. hMETIS [11]. Our proposed\nhypergraph partitioning formulation is novel in the bipartite\ngraph structure in vertex programming setting Hypergraph-\nbased general graph partitioning is studied in [10], [12].\nVI. EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we rst compare our hypergraph parti-\ntioning vertex-cut technique HYPER with the greedy vertex-\ncut GREEDY and hash-based random partitioning RANDOM.\nWe then present the evaluation of our ACO implementation\nusing GraphLab on the large-scale social network analysis\nproblem introduced in Section II. In all experiments, we use\nhMetis 13] with unbalanced factor ? = 2 and use the sum\nof external degree objective to perform the hyperedge cut.\nA. Evaluation of Partitioning Strategies\n1 different partitioning strategies on the replication factor\nof the vertex program. For more details, please refer to our\ntechnical report [14]. We generate graphs with a power-\nlaw degree distribution for consensus variable vertices with\nshape parameter ? \(? ? {2, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 degree of subproblems with parameter\n? \(? ? {1.5, 2, 0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 variables to 100, 000.\n2 the number of machines\n\(partitions A\(v factor than GREEDY and RANDOM.\n566\n\(a 2, ? = 2 b 2, m = 32 c  2, m = 32 d ts on one machine e f g iterations \(SN4M h SN2M analysis under both full and partial convergence\nIn the worst case, GREEDY replicates around 17× more\nvertices than HYPER \(? = 2, ? = 2.5,m = 2 2.8, ? = 3.5,m = 32 a vary m to show how replication factor grows\nwhen the number of machines increases. The results show\nthat HYPER is less sensitive to the number of machines than\nthe other schemes and scales better in practice.\nNext we ?x m 32, vary ? and ? to study the\npartitioning performance based on different bipartite graph\ntopologies. Recall that parameter ? determines the power-\nlaw shape, as shown in Fig. 2\(b maximum degree of the consensus nodes become, and\nthe difference between |S| and |C| is smaller, e.g., when\n 2.8, ? = 2 in the plot, |S|/|C| is only 1.78. In this\ncase, cutting the consensus nodes in HYPER provides less\nimprovement over GREEDY. On the other hand, in Fig. 2\(c variables, |S|\ndecreases, and replication factor increases. HYPER tends to\nbe less sensitive to ? than GREEDY.\nIn summary, our proposed hypergraph-based vertex-cut\nscheme outperforms the GREEDY scheme provided in the\nstate-of-the-art GraphLab implementation [7], [15] for re-\nalistic bipartite graph settings. Especially when the two\ntypes of nodes in the bipartite graph are imbalanced, which\nis typically the case in large-scale consensus optimization,\nHYPER can generate much higher quality partitions.\nB. Performance of ACO for PSL Voter 


Model\nNext We evaluate the performance of our proposed ACO\nalgorithm on an MPI 2 \(Open-MPI 1.4.3 consisting\nof eight Intel Core2 Quad CPU 2.66GHz machines with\n4GB RAM running Ubuntu 12.04 Linux. We implemented\nour algorithm using GraphLab 2 \(v2.1.4245  process with 4\nthreads \(ncpus  proposed approach can be\napplied to other vertex programming frameworks easily as it\ndoes not use any GraphLab features beyond the synchronous\nGAS API.\n1 networks using the synthetic generator in [5] and\ncreate a probabilistic model using the PSL program in Sec-\ntion II. The details of the datasets are listed in Table I. The\nsmallest, SN1M , ?ts in 4GB memory on a single machine\nwhen loaded in GraphLab; the rest of the datasets do not.\nIn the voter PSL model, the variables corresponding to the\ntruth of the VOTES\(person,party rule maps to a subproblem.\nEach VOTES\(person, party can be far more complex and many\nmore subproblems can be grounded, thus the proportion may\nbe even larger. In such cases, ACO-HYPER partitioning will\neven further reduce communication cost.\n2 PSL Inference: We use a\nGraphLab vertex program that implements ACO algorithm\ndescribed in Section IV and vary the partitioning schemes.\nWe consider performance of ACO under two settings: full\nconvergence and early stopping when one considers com-\nputation time budgets. It is important to consider the early-\nstopped setting since ACO is known to have very fast initial\nconvergence and then slow convergence toward the ?nal\noptimum 1]. In practice, one can stop early when the\nmajority of variables have converged and quickly obtain\na high-quality approximate solution. As shown in Fig. 3,\nName |S| |C| |E| |S|/|C|\nSN1M 3,307,971 1,102,498 6,011,257 3.00\nSN2M 6,656,775 2,101,072 12,107,131 3.17\nSN3M 9,962,627 3,149,103 18,113,119 3.16\nSN4M 13,349,751 4,203,703 24,288,223 3.18\nTable I\nSUMMARY OF SOCIAL NETWORK DATA SET FOR VOTER MODEL\n567\ninference in the PSL voter model converges on 99% of the\nconsensus variables with 1,000 iterations on all datasets.\nFigure 3. Convergence Rate in PSL Voter Model\nFull convergence: As shown in Fig. 2\(d e we\n?rst vary m to show the running time and speedup under\nthe full convergence setting. Because SN1M is able to ?t\non a single machine, communication cost overwhelms extra\ncomputation resources, and prevents distributed computation\nfrom performing better than single machine. In Fig. 2\(d 2-4 the single ma-\nchine setting, while ACO-HYPER has similar running with a\nsingle machine and is 2× better than ACO-GREEDY.\nOn larger data sets, our approach is approximately twice\nas fast as ACO-GREEDY \(Fig. 2\(e 2\(f 1,000 iterations, increasing the\nnumber of machines will not produce speedup in terms of\ncomputation time. In Fig. 2\(f computing models often\ninclude a pay-as-you-go cost, one may not bene?t from\nwaiting for the last few variables to converge. For instance,\nthe last 1% of vertices in SN2M take 2/3 of the total time for\nfull convergence. Motivated by this, we measure the running\ntime to complete 1,000 iterations of ACO-HYPER and ACO-\nGREEDY, regardless of the convergence status.\nIn Fig. 2\(g iteration. Note because we use synchronous setting,\nboth algorithms have the same state at the end of each\niteration. ACO-HYPER performs 2-4× better than the ACO-\nGREEDY because of the reduced communication cost In\nFig. 2\(h conver-\ngence, and ACO-HYPER always outperforms ACO-GREEDY.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we introduce a vertex programming al-\ngorithm for distributed ADMM-based consensus optimiza-\ntion. To mitigate the communication overhead of distributed\ncomputation, we provide a novel partitioning strategy that\nconverts the ADMM bipartite computation graph into a\nhypergraph and uses a well-studied hypergraph cut algorithm\nto assign vertices to machines. Our experiments on proba-\nbilistic inference over large-scale, synthetic social networks\ndemonstrate that our contributions lead to a signi?cant\nimprovement in performance. The partitioning scheme is of\nindependent interest to practitioners in vertex programming.\nVIII.

With Singapore as source \nthe speed-up varied between 1.42 and 3.85, while with Alamo \nas source, the speed-up varied from 1.35 to 3.70. Speed-up \nwas achieved not only because of the availability of faster \npeers for download, but also due to lesser bandwidth \ncontention at the source. With a 3GB source at UVACSE, no \nsite except Romulus suffered a significant slowdown. With a n15GB source at UVACSE, all sites except Romulus and Alamo \nobtained a speed-up. A speed-up of upto 1.56 was achieved. \nTypically, the 15GB downloads obtain greater speed-up than \nthe 3GB ones. This is because a lesser percentage of the \noutcalls are spent on exploring, and the penalties of \noptimistically assuming a peer to have a file are less severe.  \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nTi\nm\ne \nta\nke\nn \nin\n m\ns 0\n1G\n10G\n25G\n50G\n100G\n129\n \n \n \n n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3 Comparison of the throughput of the three approaches \nMoreover, for the 3GB download under opt-CS, it is possible \nfor a site to not download a chunk from a closer peer even \nthough the peer may have already downloaded the chunk.

The metascheduler performs the task of the \nTracker in BitTorrent by helping downloaders find each other. \nIn both systems, peers can become prospective seeders. \nBitTorrent uses a choking technique to prevent free-riding. \nThe metascheduler prevents free-riding to an extent by npreventing those BES' which do not incorporate the FSS EPR \nfrom obtaining peer knowledge. We assume that all peers are \ncooperating to achieve a common goal and assume no \nmalicious peers. \nThe state-of-the-art production grids [16, 27, 28] typically \nadvertise a manual approach for file transfer via scp or \nGridFTP 29]. Owing to storage quota constraints in the home \ndirectory at each site, users use a larger shared scratch space. \nThe heterogeneity in the scratch space purge policy of sites is n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nSi\ner\nra\nA\nla\nm\no\nIn\ndi\na\nR\nom\n'u\ns\nU\nD\nC\nU\nva\ncs\ne\nU\nK\n1\nU\nK\n2\nU\nK\n3\nJa\npa\nn\nConvent ional unopt-CS opt-CS\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nSi\ner\nra\nIn\ndi\na\nR\nom\n'u\ns\nU\nD\nC\nU\nva\ncs\ne\nU\nK\n1\nU\nK\n2\nU\nK\n3\nJa\npa\nn\nS'\npo\nre\nC onventional unopt-CS opt-CS\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nConventional unopt-CS opt-CS\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nSi\ner\nra\nA\nla\nm\no\nIn\ndi\na\nR\nom\n'u\ns\nU\nD\nC\nU\nva\ncs\ne\nU\nK\n1\nU\nK\n2\nU\nK\n3\nJa\npa\nn\nC onventional unopt-CS opt-CS\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nSi\ner\nra\nIn\ndi\na\nR\nom\n'u\ns\nU\nD\nC\nU\nva\ncs\ne\nU\nK\n1\nU\nK\n2\nU\nK\n3\nJa\npa\nn\nS'\npo\nre\nC onventional unopt-CS opt-CS\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\nConventional unopt-CS opt-CS\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nN\nor\nm\nal\niz\ned\n T\nhr\nou\ngh\npu\nt\nConventional\nunopt-CS\nopt-CS\n\(a source \(b c normalized to the conventional approach for 3GB \nfile \(top bottom problems in this manual approach. The user \nmust not only remember if the correct version of his input files nis in the scratch space of a particular site, but also remember \nthe policies of each site. Table 4 shows the heterogeneity in \nscratch space purge policy among a few XSEDE sites. Such \nan approach defeats an important use-case of computational \ngrids - "the user must not think" and should just "submit and \nforget" [14]. \nOn the other hand, grid middlewares like GenesisII [23] \nand Globus [30] have components like BES [12] and WS-\nGRAM [13]. Some of these services support sharing of input \nfiles by jobs at a site. The shared files are 


deleted once the last \njob finishes. Consequently, reuse which is inevitable in \nscientific research is not addressed. \nARC [20] is a grid middleware with a cache for handling \nfile sharing and reuse. However the cached files are readable \nonly by jobs within the site. Cabinet has a globally visible \ncache resulting in both performance and availability benefits. \nGridFTP [29] is a file transfer mechanism which also uses nparallel-TCP for mitigating the inherent slowness of TCP. rftp \n[31] is a file-transfer tool implemented on GridFTP which \ndownloads from multiple replicas simultaneously. \nTypical staging techniques do not address the possibility of \ntreating other execution sites as possible replicas. To the best \nof our knowledge, this is the first system to employ such a \nstaging technique. In this paper, each site downloads from \nonly one peer at a time. But our work can be extended to \ndownload from multiple peers simultaneously, and we leave \nthat as a future work. \nVIII. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we described two techniques for efficiently \nmanaging data in the GFFS- a caching system and a new file \nstaging technique called coordinated staging. The caching \nsystem aims to achieve a “once is enough” file transfer goal \nby preventing re-staging during sharing and reuse of input \nfiles. The main contribution of this work is coordinated \nstaging which treats execution sites as possible replica-stores. \nTwo techniques to perform coordinated staging were \ndiscussed: an unoptimistic and an optimistic approach. \nCoordinated staging decreased the download time by upto \n3.85x, and increased the throughput by upto 2.86x over the \nconventional approach of file-transfer from a single source. \nAlso, the optimistic approach was on average 1.17x better \nthan the unoptimistic approach. \nACKNOWLDEGMENT \nThis material is based upon work supported in part by the \nNational Science Foundation under Grant No. 0910812 This \nwork used the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery \nEnvironment \(XSEDE National \nScience Foundation grant number OCI-1053575. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] A.

order to assess the benefit of\nthe whole architecture. The relative importance or weights\nfor the value aggregation rules must be known beforehand\nand are an input to the model.\nCost model\nThe goal of the cost model is to provide an estimate of the\nlifecycle cost of an architecture \(i.e., a set of constellations\nand ground stations particular differ-\nentiating between different contract modalities, \(procurement\nvs hosted payloads vs 100 commercial cost, operations cost, and\nprogram overhead. Some of these are further divided into\nnon-recurring and recurring costs, as illustrated in Fig. 3.\nPayload Cost—Payload cost is only incurred when the con-\ntract modality is procurement or hosted payloads. If a 100%\ncommercial approach is taken, payload cost is set to zero,\nas it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by the\nprovider. Payload cost is the sum of a non-recurring cost\nand a recurring cost. When these values are not provided by\nFigure 3. Lifecycle cost breakdown\nthe user, they are estimated using CERs that utilize payload\nmass m and number of channels n as independent variables.\nThe CERs are taken from the USCM8 model [23] and are\nprovided below. All values are in FY2010$k.\nCpayl,NR = 339m+ 5127n \(6 7 cost\nof fabricating a qualification unit and Cpayl,R is the cost of\nfabricating the first flight unit. The standard error of the\nestimate \(SEE SEE of Equation 7 inside\nthe domain 38-928kg is 28%. All SEEs are corrected for the\nnumber of degrees of freedom. Total cost for development\nand fabrication of N identical payloads is thus given by:\nCpayl = Cpayl,NR N\nbCpayl,R \(8 is only incurred when the contract\nmodality is procurement. If a 100% commercial approach\nor hosted payloads approach are taken, bus cost is set to zero,\nas it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by the\nprovider. Bus cost is the sum of a non-recurring cost and a\nrecurring cost. When these values are not provided by the\n10\nuser, they are estimated using CERs that utilize subsystem\nmass as the independent variable. The CERs are taken from\nthe USCM8 model [23] and are provided below. All values\nare in FY2010$k.\nCbus,NR = 110.2mdry \(9 10 is the devel-\nopment cost including the cost of fabricating a qualification\nunit and Cpayl,R is the cost of fabricating the first flight\nunit. The standard error of the estimate \(SEE 114-5127kg is 47%. The SEE of Equation\n10 inside the domain 288-7398kg is 21%. Total cost for\ndevelopment and fabrication of N identical buses is computed\nas illustrated in Equation 8, with a learning factor of 95%.\nNote that the computation of bus cost depends on the dry\nmass of the spacecraft. This can be provided by the user,\nor it can be estimated by the spacecraft design module, which\nis described later in this section.\nLaunch Cost—Launch cost is only incurred when the contract\nmodality is procurement. If a 100% commercial approach\nor hosted payloads approach are taken, launch cost is set to\nzero, as it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by\nthe provider. Launch cost is given by the sum of the costs of\nlaunching all constellations in the architecture. Computation\nof launch cost for a constellation is based on the assumption\nthat, given a constellation of P planes and S satellites per\nplane, P < NL < PS launches are necessary to launch\nthe constellation, i.e., at least one launch per plane \(in\nother words, satellite engines are not sized to do inclination\nchanges after injection by taking into account both\nperformance and geometrical considerations.\nIn particular, a database of launchers is available to each\nconstellation. This database is shown in Table 5. Note that\nthe data concerning performance is provided in terms of the\n3 coefficients of a quadratic function of the orbit altitude.\nIn other words, if the entry of the table for a certain orbit\ntype \(e.g., LEO polar  then the\nperformance at altitude h can be computed as :\nperf\(h 11 computed as follows:\nNL = max{NL,mass, NL,vol, NL,dim} \(12 required\ngiven the total spacecraft mass and the performance of the\nlaunch vehicle to the desired orbit NL,vol is the minimum\nnumber of launches required given the total spacecraft vol-\nume and the volume of the launch vehicle; NL,dim is the\nminimum number of launches required given the sum of the\nmaximum dimension of all spacecraft and the height of the\nlaunch vehicle:\nNL,mass = d\n?NS/C\ni=1 mwet,i\nperf\(lv, orbit 13 14 15 spacecraft in the constella-\ntion, mwet,i, voli, and dmaxi are the wet mass, volume,\nand maximum dimension respectively of spacecraft i, and\nperf\(lv, orbit the volume, and the height respectively of\nthe launch vehicle. Once the number of launches has been\ncomputed launch cost is simply given by the product of\nnumber of launches and launch cost.\nGround segment cost—Ground segment cost is the sum of a\nnon-recurring cost and a recurring cost. When these values\nare not provided by 


the user, they are estimated using CERs\nthat utilize location of the facility, the number of spacecraft,\nand spacecraft lifetime as independent variables. The CERs\nare taken from [23] and are provided below. All values are in\nFY2010$k.\nCground,R = Cground,NR + Cground,Rt\(yr loc n$\nm2\n m2 0.5\n$M\nS/C/yr\nNS/Ct\(yr 16 loc construction cost in different locations, A is\nthe floor area of the facility in m2, and t\(yr lifetime\nin years. The values of the adjustment factor are taken from\n[23].\nService fees— Service fees are only applicable for hosted\npayloads and 100% commercial approaches. In these cases,\nthey can replace payload bus, launch, or ground segment\ncost. Service fees for the hosted payloads approach are\ncomputed as a fix quantity \(10$M resources such as volume, mass, power, data rate, or a\ncombination thereof. Service fees for the 100 commercial\napproach are computed as a fixed quantity \($2k spacecraft design module can be by-\npassed by choosing to assign a commercially available bus\ninstead of designing a bus. While the standard bus approach is\ncloser to reality, the spacecraft design module provides more\ndistinction in lifecycle cost between different architectures,\nand therefore it is chosen as the primary operating mode of\nthe tool. The spacecraft design module is an iterative module\nthat provides a subsystem-level design of the spacecraft bus\nincluding a very rough configuration of the spacecraft from\nthe payload requirements.Assumptions concerning the differ-\nent sub-modules in the spacecraft design module namely the\nbus selection module and the four steps of the process shown\n11\nTable 5.

The values shown in Table 6 were taken\nfrom 25]:\nThe ?VADCS required for ADCS depends on the ADCS\nconfiguration, as shown in Table 7. These values were\nadapted from [25].\nThe ?Vdeorbit is computed assuming that LEO spacecraft are\ndeorbited using atmospheric drag, and all other spacecraft\nare deorbited using solar radiation presure. For drag-based\ndeorbiting 


the?Vdeorbit is computed based on a change of\nsemimajor axis from the current circular orbit to an elliptical\norbit that has the perigee at 0km and the apogee at the orbit\naltitude:\n?Vdeorbit,drag = ?V \(r, r RE , r, r 23 semimajor axis from the\ncurrent circular orbit to an elliptical orbit that has the same\nperigee and a slightly higher apogee:\n?Vdeorbit,SRP = ?V \(r, r, r, r + ?h, r 24 are due to the GEO restricted zone, the\n35km are to allow for gravitational perturbations, and the\nremaining margin depends on the magnitude of the effect of\nsolar radiation pressure on the spacecraft \(the larger the ef-\nfect, the larger the margin the spacecraft.\nOnce the ?V has been calculated, it is possible to compute\nthe propellant mass required to satisfy this ?V budget. The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators. The mass\nof the sensors is driven by the attitude knowledge accuracy\nrequirement acc \(Equation 26 satisfy by the momentum storage h required \(Equation 27 26 27 that acc can vary depending on the architecture, as the\npointing requirements of a high gain antenna, or an optical\npayload, are very different from those of a low gain antenna.\nConcerning the momentum storage h, it is assumed to be\nsized to counter the different disturbance torques produced by\natmospheric drag, gravity gradient, solar radiation pressure,\nor the Earth’s magnetic field. Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload. The\nconstans k that are used for each subsystem are summarized\nin Table 8.\nThe mass of the launch adapter mLA = 0.01mdry is added\nto the mass of the spacecraft.\nUpdate spacecraft mass and dimensions—After the first iter-\nation, the dry and wet mass of the spacecraft are updated.\nDimensions are estimated assuming a perfect cube of 100\nkg/m3. The mass and dimensions of the solar panels are\ntaken into account to update the inertial properties of the\nspacecraft, as illustrated in Equation 30:\nLA = 1.5s+ 0.5\n?\nAa\n2\nIz = 0.01mdry\nIx = Iy = Iz + L\n2\naMa \(30 design algorithm is\niterative because several feedback loops appear in the N2\nmatrix showing the dependences between different modules\nin the algorithm. For instance, the mass of the ADCS depends\non the mass of the spacecraft, which obviously depends on the\nmass of the ADCS. Thus, a set of convergence criteria need\nto be defined. The convergence criteria used by the tool are\ndescribed in Equation 31:\n|mdry,i+1 ?mdry,i| < 10kg 31 the current status of the MIT archi-\ntecture study for the SCaN system.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
