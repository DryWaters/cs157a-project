On the\nother hand, VANETs are error prone networks due to the high\nmobility of the nodes and the wireless channel. The sum of these\ntwo factors makes video transmission a hard to manage task. In\nthis paper we evaluate the new emerging video coding standard\nHEVC and how it behaves under packet losses conditions in a\nVANET.\nKeywords—HEVC, VANET, packet loss, error concealment.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nVideo transmission over all kinds of networks is a field that\nhas kept growing in the last years. Nowadays the improvements\nin network properties \(increasing bandwidth in ADSL, 4G\ncellular networks, etc of\nvideo codecs and an increase in processing ability and storing\ncapacity of all kinds of devices \(desktop computers, smart-\nphones, tablet computers use video streaming, being video-\nsharing, advertising and video-conferencing three of the most\nwidely spread.\nDigital uncompressed videos contain large amounts of data.\nThis is the reason why video codecs play an important role,\nas they are able to compress video sequences with large frame\nsizes and frame rates into relatively small bitstreams while\nkeeping the quality of perception acceptable. The continuous\nimprovements in the efficiency of video codecs are bound to an\nincrease in their computational complexity. This complexity is\npartly alleviated by the growing computation ability of devices\nand by other techniques like parallel computing.\nCommunication networks is an area where data packet\nlosses are encountered to a greater or a lesser extent. These\nlosses are more pronounced in wireless networks and specifi-\ncally even more considerable in VANETs \(Vehicular Ad-Hoc\nNetworks data used for the management of\nthe network itself. Wireless transmission and a high relative\nspeed of nodes produce consequences like attenuation of signal\ncaused by obstacles, Doppler Effect caused by relative speed,\nrapidly varying network topology caused by vehicles taking\ndifferent routes, etc. So, video transmission over VANETs\nis a hard to manage task due to the combination of the\nhigh requirements of digital video and the hard conditions of\nthe network. Nevertheless, video streaming can have multiple\napplications in VANETs, like context advertising, emergency\nvideo calls, tourist information, road conditions, control of\ntraffic jams, ...\nThe mechanisms that reduce the number of lost packets\nat network level are useful and necessary. They are usually\nbased on the introduction of certain levels of redundancy in the\ninformation which allows to retrieve some of the lost packets\n\(or even all of them are always some inevitable losses. In video streaming,\ndata losses are not only produced by lost packets Also,\npackets that arrive too late to be useful are discarded. So,\ntechniques like traffic classification and priorization can also\nplay an important role in data protection. In addition to the\nprotection of packets at network level, data can be protected at\napplication level. A simple example of this type of protection is\nbuffering. Buffering allows enjoying watching a video without\n\(excessive appreciable jitter.\nIn video streaming, as well as general techniques like\nbuffering, we can use ad-hoc protection. When decoding a\nvideo stream which has some missing parts, not all the pieces\nof information have the same importance for the reconstruction\nof the video. The loss of certain packets will affect more than\nthe loss of others in the final quality of the reconstructed video.\nFor example, the loss of a frame used as a reference for other\nframes will bring a greater degradation of the reconstructed\nvideo than the loss of a frame which is not used as a\nreference by any other frame. This means that we can assign\nan “intelligent protection to the packets in such a way that\nthe more important a packet is, the larger the effort is made\nto protect it. Also, at encoding time, decisions can be made\nin order to make the coded sequence more or less resilient to\nerrors and their propagation along the video sequence.\nThe aim of this work is to study how the new and\nemerging standard on video coding HEVC \(High Efficiency\nVideo Coding  packet losses in\nVANET scenarios. It pretends to be useful for designing and\nimplementing mechanisms of error resilience and concealment\nfor this standard which will allow to palliate the damage that\npacket losses cause on the final quality of reconstructed video.\nDifferent studies can be found about HEVC efficiency,\nusually comparing it with the previous standard H.264/AVC\n978-1-4799-0543-0/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE\n\(Advanced Video Coding    where the authors developed a framework for evaluating\nHEVC encoded content under a range of packet loss band-\nwidth restriction and network delay scenarios. On the other\nhand, several solutions have been proposed for improving\nvideo streaming over VANETs. Most of these works evaluate\nvideo quality taking only into 


consideration the percentage of\nlost packets [5]. In [6] and [7] the authors propose network\nsolutions for the delivery of video over VANETs \(by measuring\nvideo quality in an analytical way transmission over VANETs in a more realistic way.\nFirst, VANET simulators are used to implement scenarios\nwith real world maps. Then, real HEVC encoded video is\nstreamed through these scenarios. At last, reconstructed videos\nare obtained and video quality with respect to the zero-loss\nvideo sequence is measured.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section II\na brief description of HEVC is presented, highlighting the new\nfeatures which are different from its predecesors. In Section III\nit is described the environment where the tests have been\ndone. Section IV explains the results obtained for the different\nconfigurations that we have tested. At last, in Section V, several\nconclusions are drawn.\nII. HEVC\nIn 2004 and 2007 ITU-T VCEG \(Video Coding Experts\nGroup Moving Pictures Experts Group new techniques to improve\nthe previous video coding standard, H.264/AVC. By 2010 the\ntwo organisms joined their forces, formed the JCT-VC \(Joint\nCollaborative Team on Video Coding the development of a new standard. The aim of\nthe project was doubling the coding efficiency of H.264/AVC,\nthis is, achieving a 50% reduction in bit rate at the same level\nof quality. On January 25, 2013 the new standard, HEVC, was\nagreed. Some works discuss if the real improvement of the\nnew standard over the previous one has reached the proposed\ngoal or not. What seems clear is that HEVC outperforms\nH.264/AVC and more noticeably at very high resolutions.\nHEVC is very similar to H.264/AVC. They follow the\nsame hybrid compression scheme. First, a frame is divided\ninto small blocks and some estimation and compensation is\ndone Estimation searchs for similar pixels around the block\nin the same frame \(intrapicture in\nother \(previously coded and decoded interpicture substracts\nthat “prediction” from the present block. Then the residuum is\ntransformed into the frequency space. The coefficients obtained\nby this operation are then quantized in order to reduce the\nnumber of bits needed to represent them. The quantized\ncoefficients are, finally, entropically coded to further compress\nthe bitstream. The coded frame is then decoded and kept in\na buffer so it can be taken as a reference for other frames. A\ngood overview of the new emerging standard is provided by\nsome of the members of JCT-VC in 8].\nAlthough HEVC and H.264/AVC share the same compres-\nsion scheme, there are some differences between them which\nallow HEVC outperforming H.264/AVC. In H.264/AVC the\nsmall units in which a frame is divided have a fixed size\nof 16x16 luma data samples \(and its correspondant chroma\nsamples MB In HEVC these\nunits are called Coding Tree Units \(CTU samples. When coding\nlarge homogeneous regions in a frame, large blocks behave\nmuch better than small blocks The number of intrapicture\nprediction modes has been increased from 10 \(H.264/AVC HEVC modes allow to get a better prediction\nof the current coding unit and therefore residual samples are\nsmaller and provide higher compression rates. A deblocking\nfilter is used both in H.264/AVC and HEVC. After deblocking,\nand before using the reconstructed frame as a reference for\nmotion estimation, a new process is introduced in HEVC:\nSample Adaptive Offset \(SAO groups of them and applying a differ-\nent offset for each group. This method increases the quality of\nthe reconstructed frames. The entropy encoder for H.264/AVC,\nCABAC \(Context Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coder has\nbeen upgraded and made more efficient in HEVC. Two new\nstructures have been defined in HEVC that did not exist in\nH.264/AVC: tiles and WPP \(Wavefront Parallel Processing parallel processing in\ncoding and decoding frames. Tiles are rectangular regions of\na picture that can be indepently decoded. WPP is a technique\nthat divides a frame into rows of CTUs. Every row of CTUs\ncan be indepently encoded \(or decoded and\nadaptation of the entropy encoder \(or decoder further information about\nHEVC the reader can consult [8].\nFor our experiments we have used version HM-9.0 of the\nHEVC reference software [9]. When HEVC reference software\nencodes a video sequence, it produces a bitstream with a\nformat that is appropriate to be stored in a file. We have\nmodified reference software encoder and decoder Real-time Transport\nProtocol packets in order to transmit them through VANETs\nand then reconstruct the decoded video sequence HEVC\nreference software decoder crashes when it tries to decode\na bitstream with missing parts. So we have also modified the\ndecoder to make it robust against packet losses. This robustness\nimplies that missing packets will not make the decoder fail\nand it will continue decoding the rest of the received RTP\npackets With these modified versions of the encoder and the\ndecoder we can build the reconstructed version of the video\nand measure its quality.\nIII. FRAMEWORK\nA. Simulators\nFor the tests we have used two main blocks. On the\none hand, an open-source vehicular traffic simulator: SUMO\n\(Simulation of Urban MObility  


simulator models\nthe behaviour of vehicles in urban scenarios, taking into\nconsideration the interaction of vehicles with other vehicles,\njunctions, traffic lights, multilane roads, etc. On the other hand,\nwe have used OMNeT++ [11] for simulating communications.\nOMNeT++ can be considered a framework for building spe-\ncific network simulators. So we have used two of the projects\ndeveloped for OMNeT++ named MiXiM \(Mixed Simulator  Vehicles in Network Simulations  mobile wireless networks.\nVeins adds specific IEEE protocols approved for their use in\nVANETs \(IEEE 802.11p and IEEE 1609 WAVE CCH and the Service Channels \(SCH  feature is modeling obstacles which will\nattenuate wireless signals in a realistic way. The two blocks:\nSUMO and OMNeT++/MiXiM/Veins are connected by TraCI\n\(TRAffic Control Interface between SUMO \(TraCI-Server TraCI-\nClient behaviour of vehicles \(for example, turning the speed of\na vehicle into 0 in order to simulate an accident OMNeT++\nreads periodically from SUMO the position of every vehicle in\nthe simulation. The visualization of the experiments is carried\nout by OMNeT++ GUI \(Graphical User Interface developed a module that\nallows us to define servers \(video transmitters video receivers server announces a video service through\nthe Control Channel periodically at 1 second intervals These\nmessages include information with the number of the Service\nChannel in which the transmission is taking place. The nodes\nof the network listen periodically to the CCH \(this is one of the\nfeatures of IEEE 1609.4 order to get beacons from other\nvehicles, emergency messages and announcements of services.\nAfter the reception of an announcement of a video service,\na node marked as a client, switches to the specified SCH,\nan begins capturing video packets. Client nodes save packet\ninformation and also create files with basic statistics, like the\npercentage of lost packets. From the file of received packets\nwe will obtain the reconstruction of the decoded video in order\nto evaluate its quality. We have also introduced another kind\nof node: the background traffic source. This node inserts CBR\n\(constant bit rate injecting packets\nof a specified size at an indicated rate \(packets per second configurations\nSome parameters are common for all the experiments and\nsome others are changed in order to check the impact of them\nin the experiments.\n1 area of 2000m x 2000m located in the city of Kiev, the\ncapital of Ukraine, obtained from the free geographic data base\nOpenStreetMap [15] and converted to SUMO format with the\ntools included in SUMO \(netconvert polyconvert RSUs \(Road Side Unit RSUs are placed in the following way: one node\nis in the middle of the main avenue and the other two are\nat the beginning and the end of the avenue. These two nodes\nhave a small zone in which their coverage overlaps with the\nmiddle node coverage. Figure 1 shows three big circles of the\nsame color \(red 2 in the edges and\n1 in the middle of the scenario its color. There is also a big\nFig. 1. VANET scenario in OMNeT++. \(red rectangles = buildings // big\nred circles = RSUs // big blue circles = video clients // small black&yellow\nsquares = background traffic sources small circles = other vehicles blue video. Every time a video packet is received its circle\nchanges its color. These changes of color in RSUs and video\nclients helps us to see what is really happening. Background\ntraffic nodes are represented by a small black&yellow other vehicles.\nA car driven along this avenue is always reached by the\nsignal of, at least, one of the RSUs The maximum vehicle\nspeed has been stablished to 14 m/s \(50.4 km/h the physical parameters of the network\ninterface cards as they are configured in the Veins example\n[13]. Every data packet is sent to the network using broadcast.\nThe 3 RSUs broadcast the same video sequence in a\nsynchronized way. They synchronize themselves by means of\nthe infrastructure network. In this manner, when a car moves\ninto the coverage area of an RSU and leaves the previous\none, it can keep receiving the same video sequence. Typical\napplications of this could be contextual advertising or some\nkind of information about the city, like tourist information,\nlocal news, traffic jams, etc.\nWe have also launched the symmetric experiment in which\na vehicle transmits a coded video to the RSUs, which are\nconnected to infrastructure networks, in order to send the\nvideo where it may be of any use. Such a transmission could\nbe useful in the following scenario: a crashed car records a\nvideo including sequences of the condition of the passengers,\nan emergency video-call, or the state of the surroudings of\nthe car \(chemical spills, fire, other crashed vehicles injured\npedestrians 


video to the RSUs, and the\nRSUs forward that video through the infrastructure network.\nThis is sometimes refered in the literature as “data muling”.\nThis video could be used by emergency services in order to\nhelp the people in the crashed vehicle, to protect the area near\nthe accident and also for example to reroute the traffic in the\nsurroundings.\nWe have used the video sequence named “Race Horses”\nwhich is one of the sequences used in JCT-VC Common\nConditions [16]. It has a frame size of 832x480 pixels, a frame\nrate of 30 frames per second and a total length of 300 frames.\nWe have coded it with a Quantization Parameter \(QP coded video sequence is sent through the network\nin a cyclic way.\n2 enumerate the dif-\nferent parameters that we have varied to make comparisons\nbetween the experiments. Some experiments have been done\nwith no background traffic and no beacons sent by the vehicles.\nThese experiments try to find out the “practical” minimum of\nlosses that would appear without any traffic in the network.\nThese losses are due to collisions in the overlapping zones. The\nrest of the experiments have been done with some background\ntraffic using different packet sizes at different packet rates.\nAs it has already been mentioned the coded video se-\nquence is sent in a cyclic way. It has been coded using\nLowdelay-P \(LP from Common Conditions\n[16]. LP mode generates a bitstream where the first frame of\nthe sequence is coded as an I frame and the rest of the frames\nare coded as P frames with the restriction that reference frames\nare always selected from previous frames \(in display order AI where all\nthe frames are coded as I ones smaller bitstream and so a\nsmaller bitrate. This mode is faster than Random Access \(RA not have to wait for future frames \(in\ndisplay order but slower. AI is faster but less efficient. We have\nchosen a compromise between bitrate and coding/decoding\nspeed.\nThe first packets of a video sequence are essential for the\ndecoder to do any decoding If they are missing the decoding\nprocess simply cannot begin and no reconstructed video can be\nbuilt. This is the reason why we assume that the first packets\nof a sequence are protected by some network mechanism and\nthey cannot be missed.\nWe have coded the original sequence at 1, 2, 4, 8, 13 and\n26 slices per frame. Every slice will travel in a different RTP\npacket. If we divide a frame in several slices the loss of one\nRTP packet will not imply the loss of the complete frame but\nonly part of it \(because slices can be independently decoded slices are independent, compression is not as efficient at 26\nslices per frame as at 1 slice per frame. The frame rate of the\nsequence is 30 frames per second so we will send 30, 60, 120,\n240, 390 an 780 packets per second for each number of slices\nper frame, to keep the video frame rate. The more slices per\nframe used the smaller the packets will be. This variability in\nthe size and number of packets per second will lead to diverse\nresults when competing with other applications for the SCH\n\(here represented by the injection of background traffic LP LPI32 without any losses and with simple losses \(without background\ntraffic using pure LP mode.\nThis mode only introduces an I frame at the beginning of the\nsequence, so when packet losses appear, the error in one slice\n“infects” the frames that use this one as reference and there is\na great drift. For alleviating this effect we have modified LP\nconfiguration file and created “Lowdelay-P-I32-CDR LPI32 error does not\npropagate further than 32 frames away \(approximately one\nsecond of video Rate-Distortion in absence of losses\nIn Figure 2 we can see the rate-distortion curves for the\nvideo sequence coded in LP and LPI32 modes without any\nlosses \(solid curves when we code it with 1 slice per frame when we code it with 26 slices per frame 0.05\ndB of difference in PSNR \(Peak Signal-to-Noise Rate an increase is\ndue mainly to the overhead introduced by dividing a frame into\nso many slices, and is also due to the fact that coding small\nparts independently is less efficient than coding the frame as a\nwhole. We have also found that adding an I CDR frame every\n32 frames \(in LPI32 pure version of LP and the PSNR value increases\naround 0.1 dB.\nB. Rate-Distortion with simple losses\nThe first experiment consists in measuring packet losses in\nthe absence of background traffic. The client vehicle travels\nfrom the beginning of the avenue until the end, and receives\nvideo packets from each of the 3 RSUs when it is in their\nzone of coverage. Packet losses occur only in the areas where\nthe signals of two RSUs are overlapped. Percentage of losses\nis around 0.57% for every combination of slices per frame.\nIn Figure 2 the dashed curves show the PSNR values of the\nvideo sequence for this “simple” losses. It can be clearly seen\nthat LP reduces its quality more than LPI32. LPI32 reduces its\nquality around 0.20 dB and LP around 0.47 dB. This is due to\nthe fact that when isolated losses occur, LPI32 recovers very\nquickly from errors and LP does not.\nC. Percentage of packet losses with background traffic\nIn Table I we can see the percentage of lost 


packets at\ndifferent background traffic rates \(packets per second, packet\nsizes slices per frame. First we can\nsee that data losses are more influenced by the packet rate than\nby the packet size. At 30 pps of 512 bytes \(122.88 kbps 245.76 kbps lost\npackets are very similar. A similar behaviour can be seen for\n90 pps: doubling the size of the packet and therefore the data\nrate every 5 packets gets lost. This rate of losses is\nhard to deal with, and especially if we are dealing with video\nstreaming. This is what would happen if two different video\nstreams at 26 slices per frame would compete in the same SCH.\nSecondly, we can see that for 30 pps and 90 pps traffic, when\nthe number of slices per frame increases, the percentage of lost\npackets decreases. This is because, at high video packet rates,\nfor example at 26 slices per frame, a high number of video\npackets are not competing with background traffic. This may\nseem a kind of solution \(to increase the number of slices per\nframe due to channel\nsaturation, like stated before. So, it seems that keeping the\nnumber of slices per frame at an intermediate level may be a\ngood compromise.\nTABLE I. PERCENTAGE OF PACKET LOSSES AT DIFFERENT\nBACKGROUND TRAFFIC. \(PPS=PACKETS PER SECOND / B=BYTES /\nSPF=SLICES PER FRAME 26spf\n30pps/512B 6,9 4,9 2,7 1,6 1,3 0,9\n30pps/1024B 7,4 4,6 2,8 1,6 1,3 1,0\n90pps/512B 12,2 13,2 9,5 5,4 3,6 2,2\n90pps/1024B 12,9 13,4 9,9 5,5 3,8 2,4\n780pps/512B 20,1 17,9 18,1 18,6 19,3 20,5\n780pps/1024B 19,5 20,7 21,3 21,6 21,9 34,5\nD. PSNR with background traffic\nIn Figure 3 the rate-distortion curves for the tests of the\nprevious section have been drawn. As it was clear for the\npercentage of lost packets, video quality values also indicate\nthat packet rate is more important than packet size when trying\nto guarantee a certain video quality. Video sequences which\nlie under 25 or 26 dB are not suitable for watching. So,\nby combining data from Table I and Figure 3 we can state\nthat percentages of packet losses over 1.3% lead to decoded\nsequences in bad conditions for their use. HEVC is very\nsensitive to packet losses, even when introducing an I frame\nevery second.\nE. LP vs LPI32\nAt the first experiments we could state that pure LP mode\nwould not resist even the minimum packet loss. This becomes\nnoticeable in the first tests with “simple” losses. That was the\nreason for using LPI32 mode for our experiments. Now, we\ncan see by means of Figure 4 that, when background traffic is\ndelivered, this situation gets even worse. With a background\ntraffic of 30 pps and 1024 bytes/packet, LPI32 suffers a drop of\n2.76 dB at 26 slices per frame, and a drop of 8.82 dB at 1 slice\nper frame. In the same conditions LP suffers a drop of 5.97\ndB at 26 slices per frame and 14.95 dB at 1 slice per frame.\nFig. 3 Rate-Distortion curves for Lowdelay-P-I32-CDR \(LPI32 curves for Lowdelay-P \(LP LPI32 intra refresh improves error resilience of\ncoded videos in error prone networks \(although it may not be\nenough the reference software, implementing a simple error\nconcealment method. If one slice is missing for decoding then\nthe decoder copies the corresponding slice of the previously\ndecoded frame. So, instead of a gray area for the missing\nslice, we will get an approximation to the lost data. Although\nPSNR values do not increase much with this method, it can be\nseen from figures 5, 6 and 7 that subjective evaluation shows\nan improvement This is clearly noticed when playing the\nsequence. This method is not of much help when severe losses\noccur However, for small percentages of losses, it smooths the\nerrors and conceals some annoying artifacts.\nG. The symmetric experiment\nAs we have mentioned before, we have also performed\nthe symmetric experiment. Here, the vehicle moving along the\navenue sends a video sequence and the RSUs act as video\nclients. The first and simple experiment, with no background\ntraffic, produces a 0% of packets lost. In this case, when the\nvehicle is in one of the overlapped areas, the RSUs are merely\nlistening, so there are no packet losses. Also, since the RSUs\nare located so that they cover the whole avenue, they get all\nFig. 5. Subjective evaluation Encoded/decoded frame number 276 without\nany losses\nFig. 6. Subjective evaluation. Reconstruction of frame 276 under packet\nlosses without activating the simple error concealment method\nFig. 7. Subjective evaluation Reconstruction of frame 276 under packet\nlosses with the simple error concealment method active\nthe sent packets. When the vehicle is in an overlapped area,\nthen 2 RSUs receive the same packets. This does not cause any\nproblem because the application checks this, simply discarding\nduplicated packets. When adding background traffic the results\nare very similar of those shown in Figure 3. This experiment\nhas revealed that a single vehicle sending video to the RSUs\ndoes not create any new problem; instead, it is a softer one.\nV CONCLUSIONS\nFrom the experiments and measurements we have observed\nthat HEVC is very sensitive to packet losses. Varying the\nnumber of slices per frame can lead to an improvement or\na worsening of the situation, so an adaptive mechanism that\nmeasures the SCH saturation and changes the number of slices\nper frame can help with the percentage of packet losses. Also,\nwe have observed that Intra refreshing improves the quality\nof the 


reconstructed video, but it is not enough to guarantee\na good video experience. A simple mechanism of error con-\ncealment has been implemented in the reference software, and\nsubjectively proved to give some relief to a damaged video.\nA combination of both protection of packets at network level,\nand error resilience techniques at application level is needed\nto guarantee the minimum video quality required.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported by Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia\ne Innovacio´n under project TIN2011-27543-C03-03 and Con-\nseller?´a de Educacio´n, Formacio´n y Empleo de la Generalitat\nValenciana under project ACOMP/2013/003.\nREFERENCES\n[1 B.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A. White is the Executive Director of the Brain Institute and a USTAR Professor nof Bioengineering and Neuroscience at the University of Utah.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
