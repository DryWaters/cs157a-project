An auto-regressive model is \ndesigned for the time series analysis. However, the auto-\nregressive model may cause decreasing accuracy and \nprediction in estimating parameters because it uses the \nassumption that the distribution of error term follows a \nnormal distribution. In reality, there are plenty of data nindicating that the distribution of error term does not follow \nthe normal distribution. Thus, we propose a method for solving \nthis problem by using a Pearson distribution system and \nmaximum likelihood estimation Compared with existing \nmethods, the proposed method can be applied to various time \nseries data requiring high accuracy and prediction. \nKeywords- Interval Estimation, Point Estimation, Auto-\nRegressive Model Pearson Distribution System, Maximum \nLikelihood Estimation, Nonnormal data \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nThere is an emphasis nowadays on the importance of big \ndata as the amount of data increases. Big data are very large \nand complex data sets. For the most part, big data are \ncontinually measured with the flow of time, and this is nknown as time series data. Time series data are a sequence of \ndata measured in various areas such as business-related fields, \nenvironment, and society [1]. The objective in analyzing \ntime series data is to predict future data by using past data. \nFor example, we can earn a profit by predicting stock prices \nor exchange rates in economics or prevent natural disasters \nby predicting precipitation or river outflows in environment \nscience. Time series analysis also aids in making reasonable \ndecisions with regard to social phenomena, security, and \nindustrial production. Therefore, a study on decreasing the \nprediction error and the increasing accuracy in analyzing \ntime series data is an important topic in a variety of fields.  \nThere are several methods for analyzing time series data \nsuch as the exponential smoothing method, decomposition nmethod, and Box-Jenkins model [2]. The exponential \nsmoothing method is a method of giving more recent data ngreater weight than earlier data, and the decomposition \nmethod is a means for predicting time series data by dividing \npatterns into sub-patterns, in addition to analyzing the effects \nof the properties of a time series such as seasonality, cyclic, \nand trends [3]. However, the exponential smoothing method \ncan be applied after eliminating irregular fluctuations, and \nthe decomposition method can be applied in observing \nspecific patterns in time series data. On the other hand, the \nBox-Jenkins model can be applied to various time series data \nand is the most popular method because of its high rate of \nprediction and accuracy [2].  \nThe Box-Jenkins model, that is multi-linear regression, is \na method for estimating both a model and the parameters of \nthat model by using autocorrelation of time series data [4]. \nThe Box-Jenkins model consists of a three-step iterative \nprocedure based on an identification of model, estimation of \nparameters, and diagnostic checking [4]. First, the Box-\nJenkins model is tentatively identified by examining the \nbehavior of the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation for \nthe values of a time series. Second, the unknown parameters \nof the tentatively identified model are estimated by using the \nestimation method. Lastly, we use the autocorrelation and \npartial autocorrelation of error term to confirm the adequacy \nof the identified model. If the identified model is not \nadequate, the procedure is repeated until no model is more \nacceptable than the previous one. \nThe Box-Jenkins model is classified into two large \ngroups: \(1 model and \(2 parameters; but the moving-average \nmodel results in a nonlinear equation [5]. For this reason, we \nneed to apply different methods to the auto-regressive model \nand moving-average model. Thus, we have chosen to solve nthe problem of the auto-regressive model in this paper, \nbecause the auto-regressive model is by far the most widely \nused Box-Jenkins model owing to its simplicity and ease of \nuse [5].  \nAn auto-regressive model is a multiple linear regression \nmodel using a Yule-walker equation [6]. The auto-regressive \nmodel uses the assumption that the distribution of error term \nfollows a normal distribution, the mean of which is zero and nthe variance of which is constant [7]. However, the \ndistribution of error term does not follow a normal ndistribution in real time series data [6]. Fig. 1 shows the \ndistribution of error term that is calculated after applying real \ntime series data—which is adequate for the first order of \nauto-regressive—to the auto-regressive model. The \ndistributions of error term in Fig. 1 are not fitted to the curve \nline, which is assumed to be a normal distribution. \nFurthermore, frequently the skewness of a nonnormal \ndistribution is larger than that of a normal distribution, and \n2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data\n978-0-7695-5006-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.57\n379\nG G-0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n0.\n0\n1.\n0\n2.\n0\n3.\n0\n-0.2 -0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\ny\n-2 -1 0 1 2\n0.\n0\n0.\n2\n0.\n4\n0.\n6\ng [ g \(\n-200 -100 0 100\n0.\n00\n0\n0.\n00\n2\n0.\n00\n4\n0.\n00\n6\nthe kurtosis of a nonnormal distribution has a minus or plus \nvalue in 


business-related fields [8]. \n \nFigure 1.  Distribution of Error Term. \nAn auto-regressive model cannot precisely estimate the \nparameters of a model because of the assumption before their \nestimation that the unknown distribution of error term \nfollows the normal distribution. Therefore, in the paper we \npropose point and interval estimation method for an auto-\nregressive model with nonnormal distribution of error term. \nPoint estimation is a process for estimating the best single \nvalue of a parameter as in Fig. 2-\(a estimation \nis a process of estimating a range of possible parameter \nvalues as in Fig. 2-\(b the parameter value is \nneither lower than the lowest value nor higher than the \nhighest value in the range Interval estimation has more \nadvantages than point estimation because interval estimation \ncontains prediction error and provides a range of choices, as \nin Fig. 2-\(a Estimation. \nIn the paper, we use a Pearson distribution system to \nrepresent non-normal distribution. A Pearson distribution \nsystem can represent a variety of distributions by using four \nmoments that are shape moments [9]. The first moment is the \nmean, the second moment is variance, the third moment is \nskewness, and the fourth moment is kurtosis [10]. We \nchecked that a Pearson distribution system can estimate a \nmore adequate distribution of error term than normal \ndistribution because it can reflect the properties of the four \nmoments. \nWe also use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate \nthe parameters of the auto-regressive model and the four \nmoments of Pearson distribution in the paper. Maximum \nlikelihood estimation is the most accurate method in \ncomparison with the other estimation methods if the number \nof data is large [11 Furthermore, least squared estimation is \na method for estimating variance under the assumption of a \nnormal distribution. However, maximum likelihood \nestimation is a method for estimating variance under no \nassumption 12]. \nMLPAR \(Maximum Likelihood of Pearson system for \nAuto-Regressive model addresses \nthe concerns that an auto-regressive model may cause \ndecreasing accuracy and prediction with the assumption that \nthe distribution of error term follows the normal distribution \nin estimating parameters. The proposed method calculates \nthe negative log likelihood of a type of Pearson distribution \nand estimates the distribution of the parameters as changing \nvalues of the parameters. We calculate point and interval nestimation using distribution of the parameters estimated by \nMLPAR. To evaluate the performance of the proposed \nmethod, we experiment with auto-regressive data whose \ndistribution of error term doesn’t follow the normal \ndistribution. As a result, MLPAR has better accuracy and \nprediction than existing models. \nII MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD OF PEARSON SYSTEM FOR \nAUTO-REGRESSIVE MODEL \(MLPAR auto-regressive model, Xt is the sum of the relation \nconstant of Xt-1 in the previous period, c is the constant, and \n?t is the error term [13].  \n\n\n\n\n\np\n1i\nt1tit ?cXX   \b\t\n\nTo check that time series data fit, the auto-regressive \nmodel needs to undergo the following three-step iterative \nprocedure identification of model, estimation of parameters, \nand diagnostic checking.

The autocorrelation plot of the auto-\nregressive model appears to be either damped exponential \ndying down or damped sine wave dying down and the partial \nautocorrelation plot of the auto-regressive model appears to \ncut off lag p [3]. \nSecond, the unknown parameters of the tentatively nidentified model are estimated from data by using the \nmaximum likelihood estimation. The error term is assumed \nto have been randomly selected from a normal distribution \nthat has zero mean and constant variance However, we \nchecked that the error term of the auto-regressive model does \nnot follow a normal distribution in Fig. 1. \nFinally, we use the autocorrelation and partial \nautocorrelation of error term to confirm the adequacy of the \nidentified model. If the autocorrelation and partial \nautocorrelation of error term are shown to exceed plus or \nminus standard error, the procedure is repeated until no \nmodel is more acceptable than the previous ones. \nB. Pearson Distribution System  \nA Pearson distribution system for simulating nonnormal ndistributions can represent a wide class of distributions with \nvarious skewness and kurtosis, such as gamma beta, t \ndistribution, and so on [14]. Pearson defined a Pearson \ndistribution system by the following differential equation \nwith respect to the probability density function ? [9 n\n2\n210\n10\nXcXcc\nXbb\n?\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n \b\n\nA Pearson distribution system is characterized by its four 


nmoments \(mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis  in \ndetermining the type of Pearson distribution system in \nregular sequence. The skewness, which is the third-order \nmoment, is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability \ndistribution, and the kurtosis, which is the fourth-order \nmoment, is a measure of the peakedness of the probability \ndistribution [14]. The types of Pearson distribution system \nare classified by the following parameter k. The k is defined \nby the function of ?1 and ?2. ?1 is squared skewness, which is \nthe third standardized moment, and ?2 is kurtosis, which is nthe fourth standardized moment, plus three [16]. \n\n 4?3?4\(2?\n3 k\n1212\n2\n21\n\n\n\n \b\n\nThus, a Pearson distribution system is partitioned by a \nsubset of the ?1–?2 plane into regions corresponding to nspecific types of distribution as shown in Fig. 3 [16]. For k < \n0, 0 < k < 1, and 1 < k, the distribution is types I, IV,Gand VI, \nrespectively. These three cases, which are included in B, E, \nand G area, respectively are called “the main types” [17]. \nWhen k = ±?, type III \(d B IV \(G F E G 0, types VII\(H C A Diagram of Pearson Distribution System. \nThe probability density function of type equates to Table \nI in the Pearson distribution system [16]. We use Table I in \npresenting the distribution of error term. We simulate the \nnonnormal distribution by 10,000,000 points of random \nnumbers [14]. By these random numbers, the distribution of \nerror term can approximate the density function numerically. \nTABLE I.

nComponents are business processes, software applications or \nframeworks, and hardware. Interfaces are the functional relationships, \ntechnical connections. data flows, compositions, and aggregations \nbetween these components. \nArchitectural patterns are proven solutions to recurring enterprise \narchitecture problems. They otfer architects abstracted methods and \ntechniques to work with, which have been applied in similar problems nby other experts in the field [38]. In this regards they are similar to \napplication architecture patterns in software engineering, which have \nbeen more widely used in practice. Garlan and Shaw introduced some n978-1-908320-20/9/$25.00©2013 IEEE \nexamples of architectural patterns and called them "Common \nArchitectural Styles" [39]. \nArchitecture principles are "fundamental approaches, beliefs, or means \nfor achieving a goal that give guidance to architects [40]. Architecture \nprinciples are very important parts of any solution or enterprise \narchitecture. Principles can be normative or scientific. A normative \nprinciple is "a declarative statement that normatively prescribes a \nproperty of something", whereas a scientific principle is "a law or fact \nof nature underlying the working of an artifact" [41]. The Big Data \nSolution Reference Architecture will contain normative principles that \ngive guidance to architects who are designing big data solutions. Tn a nsense, the normative architecture principles work as constraints to the \norganization; they give a certain amount of freedom to work with, but \nspecify absolute boundaries for the solution. \nFinally, architectural best practices describe other aspects that are \nimportant when creating a big data architecture. These best practices \ngive guidance in the processes in which architects surely are involved: \nmanagement, planning estimating, budgeting, cooperation with \ninternal and external suppliers, and so forth. \n2 is it described? \nType 3 reference architectures prescribe semi-detailed components \nand policies/guidelines and aggregated or semi-detailed interfaces. \nThat suits well with the Big Data Solution Reference Architecture nsince it is supposed to be an industry-independent, generic reference \narchitecture. Angelov et al. suggest to measure the level of detail by \ncounting the number of elements \(e.g. components, guidelines nnumber of aggregation levels \(e.g. layers in an enterprise architecture Architecture, with semi-detailed \ncomponents, interfaces and policies/guidelines, should not contain \nnumerous elements at more than two aggregation levels. \n3 of type 3 should have abstract or semi­\nconcrete elements. This implies that the Big Data Solution Reference nArchitecture describes its components, interfaces, and \npolicies/guidelines in a non-specific, abstract way The abstraction will \nbe done in the iterative coding cycles of the transcribed interview data. \n4 it represented? \nAccording to Angelov's model, type 3 reference architectures have \nsemi-formal element specifications. The semi-formal representation \nrequires well-detined notations of the elements of the reference \narchitecture. The different parts of the Big Data Solution Reference \nArchitecture are presented in different ways. The hardware and \nsoftware components are presented visually, in a diagram on one page nAdditional text will explain the components in detail, and their \ninterfaces. The choice for the visual representation, aided by text, was \nmade because that is the standard in existing literature and because this nrepresentation will give an overview of the reference architecture in \none notion. The other elements of the reference architecture, e.g. the \narchitecture principles and best practices, will be represented as text ntables, or lists, since no good visual representation is possible. The Big \nData Solution Reference Architecture uses the following notations: \n• ArchiMate 2.0 [42] for the components and interfaces; \n• The Pattern Language of Avgeriou and Zdun [43] for the \narchitectural patterns; \n• TOGAF 9.1 [44] for the architecture principles; \n• No specific format for best practices. \nV. THE BIG DATA SOLUTION REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE \nThis paragraph contains a summary of the Big Data Solution Reference \nArchitecture that was created after investigating the literature, \ninterviewing the experts, using grounded theory to perform nquantitative data analysis, and determining the representations of the \nvarious elements. The reference architecture is a guideline, not a \n73 \nThe 8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions \(ICITST-2013 Decide \nPATTERN I: PIPES AND FILTERS \nFollowing the data analysis, the \nfirst architectural pattern included nin the reference architecture is the \n"Pipes and Filters" pattern.

The reference architecture \nconsists of categories, according to the elements that were defined in \nthe "what" question \(dimension Dl the reference architecture; the full text, \nwhich contains an extensive explanation of the usage of the model is \navailable by request. \nA. Components & Interfaces \nThis category contains all components \(business software, and \nhardware nUsing the knowledge gained in the literature and interviews, a visual \nrepresentation in ArchiMate was made of the components that make \nup the big data reference architecture. Figure I displays the diagram. \nThe components of the reference architecture are divided into the three \ncommon ArchiMate layers Business Application, and Technology. \nThe model focusses on "what" rather than "how". The conceptual \nelements of the reference architecture are all structures. The structural \ncharacter of the model was chosen on purpose, to give architects a clear \nguidance while still presenting abstract components. The focus on \n"what" allows for an easy translation of the abstract reference \narchitecture to real physical components in the big data solutions that \nare implementations of the model. The visual representation of the \ncomponents and interfaces is semi-detailed and contains semi-concrete \nelements, following the guidelines of Angelov et al. for a "type 3" \nreference. \nB. Architectural Patterns \nArchitectural patterns "offer well-established solutions to architectural \nproblems help to document the architectural design decisions, facilitate \ncommunication between stakeholders through a common vocabulary, \nand describe the quality attributes of a software system as forces 43]. \nThese architectural patterns are important to the working of the \nreference architecture; they define the way the reference architecture \nis constructed and the way the architects should work with the \nreference architecture. The Big Data Solution Reference Architecture \ncontains two patterns: "Pipes and Filters" and Layers". \n978-1-908320-20/9/$25.00©2013 IEEE \nPATTERN 2: LAYERS \nAnother architectural pattern that can be identified from the interviews \nis "Layers", as part of the "Layered View". Codes "Cloud" and \n"Application layer is leading" both indicate a layering in the \narchitecture. The Layers pattern is closely connected to the \narchitecture principle "Loose coupling" [43]. \nThe Layers pattern is implemented in the Big Data Solution Reference \nArchitecture by representing the components of the architecture in the \nlayers Business Layer Application Layer, and Technology Layer. This \ndivision follows TOGAF and ArchiMate and is a standard partition of \nsolution architectures. \nC. Architecture Principles \nThe Big Data Solution Reference Architecture contains two principles: \n"Loose coupling" and "Interoperability". The principles were derived nfrom analysis of the literature and grounded theory using the expert \ninterviews. The two principles are presented in the following sub­\nparagraphs, with the notation prescribed by TOGAF 9.1. \nPRINCIPLE I: LOOSE COUPLING \nName Loose coupling \nStatement Create a solution with loosely coupled building blocks, e.g nmessage-exchanging software components instead of \nintegrated frameworks \nRationale By loosely coupling the components. the modularity. \nreusability and modifiability of the solution increases. Big \ndata is a fast-moving field, where components are \ndeveloped. improved, and retired frequently. To be able to \ncope with the changing requirements and components, the \nbig data solution has to be flexible. If a building block has nto be replaced. upgraded. removed. or added, other \nbuilding blocks should be impacted as little as possible By \nloosely coupling the components, these kind of actions are \nrelatively easy. \nImplications Components of the solution such as software packages, \nframeworks, databases should be selected based on their \nability to be decoupled from the solution. That means \ncomponents should have clear service contracts, data \ninterfaces and/or APls that preferably rely on messaging. \n74 \nThe 8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions \(ICITST-2013 Software and hardware should conform to defined \nstandards that promote interoperability for data napplications, and technology. \nRationale Standards help ensure consistency, thus improving the \nability to manage systems and improve user satisfaction, \nand protect existing IT investments, thus maximizing \nreturn on investment and reducing costs. Standards for \ninteroperability additionally help ensure support from \nmultiple vendors for their products, and facilitate supply \nchain integration. \nImplications Interoperability standards and industry standards will be \nfollowed unless there is a compelling business reason to \nimplement a non-standard solution. \nA process for setting standards, reviewing and revising \nthem periodically, and 


granting exceptions must be \nestablished. \nThe existing IT platforms must be identified and \ndocumented. \nD Architectural Best Practices \nThe reference architecture contains two best practices "Use free and nopen-source software" and "Agile development". \nBEST PRACTICE 1: USE FREE AND OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE \nMost architectures that are addressed in the interviews and literature \nare based on free and open-source software FOSS open-source software forms the core of big data. There \nare commercial \(proprietary available that are \nbased on the FOSS stack; for example, several large IT companies are \ntrying to solutionifY Hadoop. However, as pointed out by the \ninterviewed stakeholders, the free and open-source community is \nleading in innovation when it comes to big data software components. \nThis notion is even supported by commercial organizations such as \nIBM [32]. The FOSS products are simply better than the commercial \nones in terms of usability, modifiability, performance, reliability, and \ncosts. Vendor lock-in is avoided, and the architecture principles \n"Loose coupling" and "Interoperability" can be applied more easily nwith FOSS. \nFree and open-source \(FOSS open-source, classified according to the definition of \nthe Free Software Foundation. This definition states that software can \nused, copied, changed, and distributed by anyone [45]. The FOSS \ndefinition is tighter than the Open Source definition, which only states \nthat the software should be free of charge and the source code should \nbe publicly available and modifiable [46]. The Open Source definition \nis only applicable to practical applications, not to the social and \npolitical aspects [47]. In contrast, FOSS is about the liberty of nsoftware, not about the price. The unfortunate event is that the word \n"free" in English speech has two meanings, unlike for example French \nwhere there is fibre and gratuit. This point is made clear in Richard nStallman's famous article in which he states: "think of "free speech," \nnot "free beer."" [48]. Examples of FOSS licenses are the GNU \n\(Lesser Mozilla Public Licenses, and the Intel Open Source \nLicense [49]. \nPreferring FOSS components over proprietary software can have some \nimpact on organization, especially if this best practice is not \nimplemented yet. With FOSS, organizations cannot rely on support \ncontracts and have to build up knowledge of the components in-house. \nBEST PRACTICE 2: AGILE DEVELOPMENT \nThe expert interviews indicate a strong preference for agile nmethodologies when it comes to creating big data solutions. Therefore, \narchitects and project managers should be advised to create software \n978-1-908320-20/9/$25.00©2013 IEEE \nand hardware iteratively, and release small changes to an existing \nworking solution. Examples of methodologies that have proven to be nsuccessful in an "agile" way are Scrum [50], Kanban [51], Lean [52], \nand XP [53]. All these methods have in common that they strive for \nhigh-quality working solutions by having small teams working \ncollaboratively in short iterations, focusing on the delivery of useful \nartifacts. Each organization should take their pick for a method, as long \nas the principles in the Agile Manifesto [54] are applied strictly. For \nsome organizations that are engaging a big data project, an agile way \nof working will already be in place since agile is becoming the de-facto \nstandard in software development [55]. If that is not the case, the \nintroduction of agile development will introduce some difficulties as a \nswitch from traditional methodologies can be a cultural challenge [56]. \nVI. EVALUATION \nTen big data experts out of a sample of 50 completed a questionnaire nthat investigated the quality aspects of the Big Data Solution Reference \nArchitecture. The results of the questionnaire indicate that the reference \narchitecture meets all of the quality criteria that were defined in the \nresearch design: maintainability, modularity, reusability, performance, \nand scalability. The following table displays the average scores on the \nquality criteria, on a scale of 1 to 5. \nCriterion Score nMaintainability 2.95 \nModularity 3.10 \nReusability 3.00 \nPerformance 2.70 \nScalability 2.70 \nAltogether, this indicates that the model can be qualified as a \n'reasonably good' reference architecture. It will have its use in the \narchitecture community, and will probably be adopted once published. \nVIT. CONCLUSION \nThis paper described a research project for a reference architecture of \nbig data solutions. The reference architecture was designed using \nqualitative data analysis and grounded theory, and evaluated using a \nquestionnaire that investigated several quality criteria. \nA. Observations and Contribution \nBy presenting a questionnaire to a group of big data experts, the \nresulting reference architecture was justified and evaluated. The \nquality of the model was ramified into five criteria: maintainability, \nmodularity, reusability, performance, and scalability. A group of ten \npeople completed the questionnaire was, out of a sample of 50. That is \ntoo little to make hard classifications about the quality of the model. \nHowever, the questionnaire was only distributed to people working \nwith big data, and all respondents were more or less knowledgeable \nand experienced in that area. This makes the results of the \nquestionnaire fairly accurate, and gives certain weight to the outcome. \nNonetheless, the results should not be treated as scientific proof but as \nindicative 


evidence. \nThe overall average quality score is 2.99 on a scale of 1 to 5. This \nanswers the main research question; the created model is a 'reasonably \ngood' reference architecture for a solution with big data technology to \nperform predictive analytics of open data sources combined with \nstructured, semi -structured and unstructured data sources. \nTo summarize, the Big Data Solution Reference Architecture is a new \nand unique model that delivers a strong contribution to the community \nof architects and other people who are working with big data \ntechnology, open data, and predictive analytics. \nVITI.

order to assess the benefit of\nthe whole architecture. The relative importance or weights\nfor the value aggregation rules must be known beforehand\nand are an input to the model.\nCost model\nThe goal of the cost model is to provide an estimate of the\nlifecycle cost of an architecture \(i.e., a set of constellations\nand ground stations particular differ-\nentiating between different contract modalities, \(procurement\nvs hosted payloads vs 100 commercial cost, operations cost, and\nprogram overhead. Some of these are further divided into\nnon-recurring and recurring costs, as illustrated in Fig. 3.\nPayload Cost—Payload cost is only incurred when the con-\ntract modality is procurement or hosted payloads. If a 100%\ncommercial approach is taken, payload cost is set to zero,\nas it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by the\nprovider. Payload cost is the sum of a non-recurring cost\nand a recurring cost. When these values are not provided by\nFigure 3. Lifecycle cost breakdown\nthe user, they are estimated using CERs that utilize payload\nmass m and number of channels n as independent variables.\nThe CERs are taken from the USCM8 model [23] and are\nprovided below. All values are in FY2010$k.\nCpayl,NR = 339m+ 5127n \(6 7 cost\nof fabricating a qualification unit and Cpayl,R is the cost of\nfabricating the first flight unit. The standard error of the\nestimate \(SEE SEE of Equation 7 inside\nthe domain 38-928kg is 28%. All SEEs are corrected for the\nnumber of degrees of freedom. Total cost for development\nand fabrication of N identical payloads is thus given by:\nCpayl = Cpayl,NR N\nbCpayl,R \(8 is only incurred when the contract\nmodality is procurement. If a 100% commercial approach\nor hosted payloads approach are taken, bus cost is set to zero,\nas it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by the\nprovider. Bus cost is the sum of a non-recurring cost and a\nrecurring cost. When these values are not provided by the\n10\nuser, they are estimated using CERs that utilize subsystem\nmass as the independent variable. The CERs are taken from\nthe USCM8 model [23] and are provided below. All values\nare in FY2010$k.\nCbus,NR = 110.2mdry \(9 10 is the devel-\nopment cost including the cost of fabricating a qualification\nunit and Cpayl,R is the cost of fabricating the first flight\nunit. The standard error of the estimate \(SEE 114-5127kg is 47%. The SEE of Equation\n10 inside the domain 288-7398kg is 21%. Total cost for\ndevelopment and fabrication of N identical buses is computed\nas illustrated in Equation 8, with a learning factor of 95%.\nNote that the computation of bus cost depends on the dry\nmass of the spacecraft. This can be provided by the user,\nor it can be estimated by the spacecraft design module, which\nis described later in this section.\nLaunch Cost—Launch cost is only incurred when the contract\nmodality is procurement. If a 100% commercial approach\nor hosted payloads approach are taken, launch cost is set to\nzero, as it is included in the service fee charged to NASA by\nthe provider. Launch cost is given by the sum of the costs of\nlaunching all constellations in the architecture. Computation\nof launch cost for a constellation is based on the assumption\nthat, given a constellation of P planes and S satellites per\nplane, P < NL < PS launches are necessary to launch\nthe constellation, i.e., at least one launch per plane \(in\nother words, satellite engines are not sized to do inclination\nchanges after injection by taking into account both\nperformance and geometrical considerations.\nIn particular, a database of launchers is available to each\nconstellation. This database is shown in Table 5. Note that\nthe data concerning performance is provided in terms of the\n3 coefficients of a quadratic function of the orbit altitude.\nIn other words, if the entry of the table for a certain orbit\ntype \(e.g., LEO polar  then the\nperformance at altitude h can be computed as :\nperf\(h 11 computed as follows:\nNL = max{NL,mass, NL,vol, NL,dim} \(12 required\ngiven the total spacecraft mass and the performance of the\nlaunch vehicle to the desired orbit NL,vol is the minimum\nnumber of launches required given the total spacecraft vol-\nume and the volume of the launch vehicle; NL,dim is the\nminimum number of launches required given the sum of the\nmaximum dimension of all spacecraft and the height of the\nlaunch vehicle:\nNL,mass = d\n?NS/C\ni=1 mwet,i\nperf\(lv, orbit 13 14 15 spacecraft in the constella-\ntion, mwet,i, voli, and dmaxi are the wet mass, volume,\nand maximum dimension respectively of spacecraft i, and\nperf\(lv, orbit the volume, and the height respectively of\nthe launch vehicle. Once the number of launches has been\ncomputed launch cost is simply given by the product of\nnumber of launches and launch cost.\nGround segment cost—Ground segment cost is the sum of a\nnon-recurring cost and a recurring cost. When these values\nare not provided by 


the user, they are estimated using CERs\nthat utilize location of the facility, the number of spacecraft,\nand spacecraft lifetime as independent variables. The CERs\nare taken from [23] and are provided below. All values are in\nFY2010$k.\nCground,R = Cground,NR + Cground,Rt\(yr loc n$\nm2\n m2 0.5\n$M\nS/C/yr\nNS/Ct\(yr 16 loc construction cost in different locations, A is\nthe floor area of the facility in m2, and t\(yr lifetime\nin years. The values of the adjustment factor are taken from\n[23].\nService fees— Service fees are only applicable for hosted\npayloads and 100% commercial approaches. In these cases,\nthey can replace payload bus, launch, or ground segment\ncost. Service fees for the hosted payloads approach are\ncomputed as a fix quantity \(10$M resources such as volume, mass, power, data rate, or a\ncombination thereof. Service fees for the 100 commercial\napproach are computed as a fixed quantity \($2k spacecraft design module can be by-\npassed by choosing to assign a commercially available bus\ninstead of designing a bus. While the standard bus approach is\ncloser to reality, the spacecraft design module provides more\ndistinction in lifecycle cost between different architectures,\nand therefore it is chosen as the primary operating mode of\nthe tool. The spacecraft design module is an iterative module\nthat provides a subsystem-level design of the spacecraft bus\nincluding a very rough configuration of the spacecraft from\nthe payload requirements.Assumptions concerning the differ-\nent sub-modules in the spacecraft design module namely the\nbus selection module and the four steps of the process shown\n11\nTable 5.

The values shown in Table 6 were taken\nfrom 25]:\nThe ?VADCS required for ADCS depends on the ADCS\nconfiguration, as shown in Table 7. These values were\nadapted from [25].\nThe ?Vdeorbit is computed assuming that LEO spacecraft are\ndeorbited using atmospheric drag, and all other spacecraft\nare deorbited using solar radiation presure. For drag-based\ndeorbiting 


the?Vdeorbit is computed based on a change of\nsemimajor axis from the current circular orbit to an elliptical\norbit that has the perigee at 0km and the apogee at the orbit\naltitude:\n?Vdeorbit,drag = ?V \(r, r RE , r, r 23 semimajor axis from the\ncurrent circular orbit to an elliptical orbit that has the same\nperigee and a slightly higher apogee:\n?Vdeorbit,SRP = ?V \(r, r, r, r + ?h, r 24 are due to the GEO restricted zone, the\n35km are to allow for gravitational perturbations, and the\nremaining margin depends on the magnitude of the effect of\nsolar radiation pressure on the spacecraft \(the larger the ef-\nfect, the larger the margin the spacecraft.\nOnce the ?V has been calculated, it is possible to compute\nthe propellant mass required to satisfy this ?V budget. The\ntool assumes that ?Vinj is performed by the apogee kick\nmotor \(AKM other ?V are performed by the\nADCS subsystem. For each of these propulsion systems, the\npropellant mass can be computed using the rocket equation:\n?Vj = gIsp,j log\nmi\nmf\n\(25 which can be\ndifferent for the AKM and the ADCS subsystem, mi is the\ninitial mass with propellant and mf is the final mass without\nthe propellant.\nAttitude Determination and Control and Propulsion Subsys-\ntem—The mass of the ADCS is mostly given by the mass\nof the sensors and the mass of the actuators. The mass\nof the sensors is driven by the attitude knowledge accuracy\nrequirement acc \(Equation 26 satisfy by the momentum storage h required \(Equation 27 26 27 that acc can vary depending on the architecture, as the\npointing requirements of a high gain antenna, or an optical\npayload, are very different from those of a low gain antenna.\nConcerning the momentum storage h, it is assumed to be\nsized to counter the different disturbance torques produced by\natmospheric drag, gravity gradient, solar radiation pressure,\nor the Earth’s magnetic field. Expressions for these distur-\nbance torques were taken from [25].\nIn addition to sensors and actuators, the ADCS has additional\nmass that can be estimated as a fix fraction of the spacecraft\ndry mass:\nmADCS = 3msen + 4mact + 0.01mdry \(28 subsystem, the mass of the AKM\ncan be estimated from its propellant mass assuming a certain\nmass fraction:\nmAKM =\n\(1 29 structure subsystem\nSubsystem k\nThermal 0.0607\nAvionics 0.0983\nStructure 0.5462\nThermal, avionics, and structure subsystems—The thermal,\navionics, and structure subystems are designed using simple\nparametrics of the form msubsystem = kmpayload. The\nconstans k that are used for each subsystem are summarized\nin Table 8.\nThe mass of the launch adapter mLA = 0.01mdry is added\nto the mass of the spacecraft.\nUpdate spacecraft mass and dimensions—After the first iter-\nation, the dry and wet mass of the spacecraft are updated.\nDimensions are estimated assuming a perfect cube of 100\nkg/m3. The mass and dimensions of the solar panels are\ntaken into account to update the inertial properties of the\nspacecraft, as illustrated in Equation 30:\nLA = 1.5s+ 0.5\n?\nAa\n2\nIz = 0.01mdry\nIx = Iy = Iz + L\n2\naMa \(30 design algorithm is\niterative because several feedback loops appear in the N2\nmatrix showing the dependences between different modules\nin the algorithm. For instance, the mass of the ADCS depends\non the mass of the spacecraft, which obviously depends on the\nmass of the ADCS. Thus, a set of convergence criteria need\nto be defined. The convergence criteria used by the tool are\ndescribed in Equation 31:\n|mdry,i+1 ?mdry,i| < 10kg 31 the current status of the MIT archi-\ntecture study for the SCaN system. The study consists of a\nstakeholder analysis to identify the primary stakeholders and\ntheir needs, and the development of a computational tool to\nexplore the architectural tradespace.\nSeveral interviews have been conducted with experts at\nNASA to elicit the potential requirements on SCaN from\ndifferent user communities.\nThe major architectural decisions to be made by the SCaN\nprogram have been identified and encoded in a mathematical\nmodel. A computational tool has been developed that can\nautomatically enumerate and evaluate thousands of different\nSCaN architectures. This tool contains both a performance\nand a cost model.\nNext Steps\nThe next steps include calibration of the optical link budget\ncalculations, comparisons of the network scheduling calcula-\ntions with historical TDRSS load data, and validation of the\nspacecraft sizing algorithm with real TDRS data. Following\nthe completion of the stakeholder analysis, the tool will be\nbe used to explore the architectural tradespace and identify\na subset of preferred architectures worth studying in more\ndetail. These architectures could then be analyzed in NASA’s\nArchitecture Development Lab \(ADL NNX11AR70G.\nThe authors would also like to thank the Centre de Formacio\nInterdisciplina`ria Superior and the Cellex Foundation for\npartially funding this project.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
