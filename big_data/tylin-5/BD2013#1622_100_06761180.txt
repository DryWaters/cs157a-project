INTRODUCTION \n \nBig Data has become very comprehensive and a tech \nbuzzword these days. It is breaking down the barriers that \nexisted with exploding amount of data, historical data, \nexpensive and complicated databases. With the rapid \nevolution in the Information Technology \(IT instead of conventional Relational Database \nManagement Systems \(RDBMS DW  the global financial crisis meltdown directly \nimpacting the Sri Lankan economy, leaders in the public ncommercial, and social sectors are focusing on new business \nopportunities within the country to boost up revenue through \nforeign exchange [2]. There has been an incrementing trend \nin travel and tourism industry after the end of Sri Lanka's 30 \nyear civil war. Sri Lanka as a nation is economically growing \nwith increasing GDP growth rates and has become open for \nnew business opportunities and constantly attracts foreign \ndirect investments. \nIn a nutshell, most of Big Data related researches are based \non two main areas named: Technology of how big data to be \nprocessed[3], and marketing of tools by different vendors [4]. \nIt is a significant constraint to apply big data concepts without \nextensive re-work by expert data scientists. This paper mainly \ndiscuss on how to utilize existing big data technologies and \ntools in a more practical manner for the up-liftmen of society. \nHowever there is less research work on centralized repository \nor personal dashboard which includes Big Data indicators to \nanalyze trends, alerts, personal behavior and data. With the ngrowing size of dataset it requires repository to be scalable \nand highly efficient. \nThe research method followed full life cycle process while \nproviding descriptive and practical insight into big data \nsolution We will discuss on: Use of Hadoop and Map Reduce \nbig data distribution concepts, Crawling big data from ninternet and other sources and mapping into key value pairs, \nStore in Hbase database, reduce the data set into dashboard \nrequirements, Design of dashboard with thresholds especially \nwith big data indicators. The Dashboard embedded with \nfeatures to analyse web user clicks and categories click data \nto analyse a specific tourist, examine specific tourist behavior \nto guide in various mode, ability to turn customer transaction nhistory into intelligent recommendation for logistics, sell \nproducts and travel and tourism. \nPersonal indexes are very useful in many industries [5]. \nThis paper examines the applicability, usability and design of \nsuch indexes. The dashboard is screening personal data as an \nindex and exploration probes categorized into four indexes \nincluding Visit Index, Wealth Index, Health Index and \nLifestyle Index. While carrying out insight into theory behind \nBig Data architecture, Map Reduce and problem solving \nprocess derives these indexes efficiently. The proposed Big \nData solution assists to solve a real world problem of \nsummarizing massive quantity of data from different sources. \nMainly, it enables to provide the potential value across nstakeholder cost effectively. \nThis paper mainly consists following sections. Literature \nreview presents the summary of the research that was carried \nout, findings and decisions made. Case description and \nsolution design section present the analysis of the research, \nsystem requirements and methodology selection. This also noutlines the design phases of the solution; diagrams are \npresented that illustrates the design. Furthermore this section \ndiscusses the process carried out and the problems faced   and \nalso how the problems were given the best possible solution. \nTesting phase was carried out in order to identify weaknesses \nof the system and 


correct them. Discussion provides a critical \nevaluation of the research, and limitations of the current nsolution and possible future enhancements will be outlined. \nConclusion presents the personal reflection for the research \nand presented solution. \nII. LITERATURE ANALYSIS \nIn the literature it is recognized that necessity of integrated \nbig data solution while investigating a dichotomy exists \nbetween big data technologies and solutions. Big data \nsolution approach is still not prominent in Sri Lankan travel \nand tourism industry to generate massive revenue and deliver \n208   Big Data solution for Sri Lankan development n2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions \(ICTer nanalytic for decisions making and customer services. Analysis \nof recent studies carried by vendors, market researchers, \nsolution developers and government intervention statistics, \npolicy form the focus of big data technologies, studies of the \nobjectives and decisions confronting to design big data \nsolution which is fitting for Sri Lankan travel and tourism \nindustry. This research combines two disciplines: In contrast nAnalyze existing big data technology and solutions used in \ntravel and tourism industry. Secondly, how to utilize, leverage \nexisting technologies and design big data solutions in a more \npractical manner which will suites the travel and tourism \nindustry in Sri Lanka. \nThe statistical analysis published by the Sri Lanka tourism \ndevelopment authority \(2011 tourist traffic, as \nInternational tourist arrivals grew up to a total 980 million in \n2011. Revenue from tourism, scheduled airline operations and \npassenger movements, Income and Employment, Tourist \nPrices indicates that travel and tourism industry has a direct \ninvolvement in core foreign exchange earners in the overall \neconomy of Sri Lanka [6].  \nVarious methods has been used to extract, store, process \nand present data. With the advancement of hardware, the \nprice of storing devices and processing devices has gone \ndown Advancement of web and sophisticated devices \ngenerate the need to work with massive loads of different \nkinds of data. Bigdata can be defined as the high volume, \nhigh velocity and high variety of data assets that require new \nforms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, \ninsight discovery and process optimization [7]. The primary \nchallenge is to build frontier dashboard to analyze data by \nconverting seemingly unstructured data into useful \ninformation. \nBigdata processing got it’s initiation through commercial \ngiants like google and yahoo. Currently, it has been taken up \nby open source organizations including apache and \ncommercial organizations like Oracle and IBM [8].The \nGoogle/OTX study finds that 2011   2013 travel industry should begin considering real big \ndata solutions to provide better services and tailored travel \nexperience to their customers, as creating an integrated data \nsource, data storage issues, and working in a hybrid \ntechnological environment becomes challenge to big data \nsolutions in the travel industry. In fact, recent research \nreported that case studies of big data adoption, KAYAK \ntravel meta search engine find the best possible flight or hotel, \nAmadeus IT solutions for Air Lines “look to book” ratio nFacebook’s ad, British Airways \(BA depend \non variety of big data technologies and analytics for both \ninternal decisions and customer services 10]. Mitra \(2007 content, search function and vertical \nsearch issues [11]. Ventana \(2012 scale organisations, working with large scale data \nbeginning at one terabyte \(TB PB still \nusing relational databases for their large-scale data processing \n[12]. As states by recent research there are different types of \nbig data solutions provide by different vendors and there are \nlimitations in solutions.  Defining such solutions which is \nsuite for Sri Lankan Travel and tourism by avoiding \nlimitation is a huge task. Apart from that, how this challenge \nis met is critical because organisations are highly relying on \neffective analysis of the information to stay on competitive. \nTherefore given solution needs to align with the stakeholder \nrequirements, limitations and policies.     \nFurthermore, research proves that typically high \npercentage of RDBMS, Flat files, data warehouse appliances \nand in-memory databases are used technologies to manage \nand analyze big data [12]. There are combination of new \ntechnologies to manage and analyze big data including \nHadoop and specialized analytical technologies such as \ncolumnar databases [13 Chen et al \(2012 of data it is not practical and hard to navigate \nthrough them to find the most useful items. Predictive nanalytics, planning and forecasting and visualization \ntechniques are the process of examining large amounts of \ndifferent data. Moving forward organisations are emerging \nthese techniques into big data solutions [14 As data volumes \ngrow use of Hadoop will assist for predictive analytics and \nfor visualization [15 Comparing to the other technologies \nVentana \(2012 Hadoop to build their new products and services [12]. \nApache promotes Sqoop import data from numerous 


nrelational databases into HDFS, Hive or HBase [16]. We have \nused Apache Mahout to classify data and use as a platform for \nour research since the collection of data to be processed is \nvery large and based on collaborative filtering, clustering, and \nclassification [17]. Several practical case studies imply that \nuse of standard Hadoop's MapReduce model to investigate \nlarge data issues [18]. MapReduce framework based on nHadoop and it is easy to design efficient MapReduce \nalgorithms for an instance there may be numbers of ndocuments where each document needs a set of terms and \nneed analyse a total number of occurrences of each term in all \ndocuments therefore by using MapReduce algorithms and \nBasic MapReduce Patterns including Counting and Summing, \nCollating, Filtering, Parsing, and Validation, Distributed Task \nExecution, Sorting helps to design efficient solutions [19], \n[20]. \nGigaSpaces solutions carried out big data survey by aiming nIT and business professionals. They assert that business \ndecisions are heavily reliant on analysis of the data or to \nhandle rapidly growing data inputs. Therefore organisations \nconsider Big Data processing as mission critical and it is \nessential to data processed in real time. Furthermore the \nsurvey clearly indicates that organisations seeking \ncombination of Big Data and cloud computing solutions to \nachieve maximum output [21]. Therefore in the future \ndevelopment, authors needs to focus on the combination of \nbig data and cloud computing solution as well.    \nIII. CASE DESCRIPTION  \n \nWith the end of 30 year civil war Sri Lanka is going \nthrough a rapid development phase and one key goal is to be \ntransform Sri Lanka into a tourist hub [22]. Big Data \ntechnologies have the potential to accelerate a country's \ndevelopment in various aspects. This paper attempts to \nprovide insights into a case study of Travel and Tourism \nindustry in Sri Lanka while designing a solution to build new \nconceptual breakthroughs.  \nThe proposed dashboard can be used by organizations \nwhich already have assets of Big Data and need to kick start \nwithout any consultation fees and overheads. It is integrated \nwith comprehensive Big Data technologies to build an \nRinusha Irudeen #1and Sanjeeva Samaraweera*2  209 \n12th & 13th December 2013     2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions \(ICTer in the Big Data industry is extracting proper \nvalue from Big Data. Nowadays Organisations are investing nmillions on flashy dashboards and reporting tools. However \ndue to the lack of capabilities of these systems they are poor \nin presenting useful insights and have not achieved the \nexpected return on investment \(ROI from expensive \ndashboards and reports [23].  \nNeed for understanding Big Data solutions, adoption, and ndemand of Big Data technologies and how it could \nrevolutionize the business in novel ways has got increased nmainly due to amount and the proportion of unstructured data \nin the whole data volume [24]. \nMost solutions stick to conventional structured solutions \nwhere as others who are brave enough to get into the \nunstructured data will ultimately show information not \nworthwhile. Due to the popularity of buzzword ‘Big Data’ the nmarket is looking for proper solutions but it is imperative that \nindustry has to come up with usable solutions. Although it is \nnot an easy task, the main idea of this paper is to show a \npractical way of using the Big Data. The proposed solution \nincludes examples for unstructured and unpredictable social \nnetwork data. Organisations value their data as corporate \nasset because data can be effectively transformed into nvaluable information that is used to make business decisions. \nWith the growth of unstructured, unpredictable data, this \ninitiative is really about installing the concept of \nmanaging data and providing Big Data solutions in different \naspects.   In Travel and Tourist industry there are lots of \npossibilities in leveraging on Big Data Solutions to predict \ntheir desired travel destinations.  \nx Social networking data on purchase patterns and the \nidea about their buying power can be used for \npromotions of commodities, hotels and travel agents.  \nx Information and feedback about visits to SL in their \nblogs will immensely help hotels boutiques, airlines, \nairports and government institutes to improve their \nservices.  \nx Government authorities can use summarized data to \nimprove infrastructure and plan for capacity and \naccommodation trends.  \nx Stakeholders can estimate the number of tourists to \ncater in next season by predictions using Big Data \nanalytics.  \nx Know the current trends in tourism using social \nnetwork data of similar stakeholders in tourist \ndestinations in other countries.  \nx Stakeholders can plan customized tour packages, \npromotional discounts, end of tour souvenirs etc \naccording to consumer needs.  \n This is done by designing personal dashboards and \ngrouped total reports using Big Data analytics. \nIV. CHALLENGES \nAs revealed in the introduction, Sri Lankan government is \nlooking for to increase profitability, return on Investment nmodernize operations, improve tourist retention [25], extend \nproduct lines and reduce risk through a solution. Existing \nservices, products and solutions are constrained by traditional \ndata integration approaches that hinder productivity and \nbenefits anticipated. \nThere are significant challenges that need to be considered \nwhen designing the solution for Dashboard. Data Storage and \ncomplexity are key factors Therefore dashboard should \nleverage data from multiple internal and external sources, \nincluding structured 


semi-structured, un- structured and Big \nData types such as Hadoop. Large volume of data needs to \nanalyse right through the solution considering the \nperformance issues should be considered. In a rapidly \nchanging business environment, information has to be up-to-\ndate, accurate, and accessible and well governed [26]. New ndata sources need to be brought rapidly and existing sources \nneed to modify according to the current requirement. \nV. SOLUTION DESIGN  \nA the \nsuccess of the study.  This solution was developed using a \nthorough review of the literature on stakeholder analysis [25] \n[28], policy process [27], consider the requirements [22], \nbenefits [25 obstacles and future work as well. Initially, it is \nessential to discuss with all stakeholders and survey literature \nof tourism industry. A brainstorming session was carried out \non how best a manual reading of internet resources help to \nuplift the industry.  Furthermore, lists of reliable web \nresources were identified in order to gather information. \nIdentifying and understanding the stakeholders and their ninterests is important to provide appropriate engagement \nsolution. As explained above, the proposed solution is based \non a case study from travel and tourism industry to apply the \nBig Data concepts. It is important to understand \nthe stakeholders and their objectives in order to ensure that all \naspects have been addressed Therefore we define \nstakeholders based on interest, ownership, specialist \nknowledge, impact or influence and contribution. In working \non this paper we gathered information from all stakeholders \nincluding businessmen working in the Tourism Industry, \ntourists as well as government officers. With that information \nwe designed a common personal dashboard customized for \ntourism industry.  \nTo get information onto the dashboard we researched on \nbest available Big Data technologies to populate accurate, fast \nand important indicators for end users to take decisions [28]. \nUnlike a RDBMS which stores only transactional data or a \nDatawarehouse which facilitates management to take \ndecisions using aggregated data, the proposed personal \ndashboard will be very useful in end user to get summarized \ninformation about a person from different sources like \ninternet and make decisions [29].  \nEspecially here we are looking at the possibility of getting \ninformation on individual tourists. Going through all these \nresources manually and understanding about the tourists npersonal information is vital. The following are some basic \ncriteria for evaluating the appropriateness Wealth, Health, \npurposes of visiting the country and Life style. Regardless of \nthe purpose of visit Tourist’s life style is very important for a \ntourist hotel or any other organization which is trying to ninvest on tourist [25] [30].   \nEven though manual research proves to be best method, it \nis not effective and profitable to read about all tourists and \nkeep information beforehand and also reading on a particular ntourist from all sources is not practical. Also if the task is \ndistributed among several persons the criteria they used to see \nhow much efficient a particular tourist for investment is \nvastly different.  \nDue to these reasons it is necessary that the process should \nbe automated and proper efficient algorithms are in place in \n210   Big Data solution for Sri Lankan development \n2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions \(ICTer computerized \ndashboard will be very helpful for stakeholders to compare \nefficiency with the average samples Therefore authors came \nup with the concept of tourist personal dashboard showing a \nsingle efficiency index derived from various indexes gathered \nusing social network sites. This approach is likely to optimize \nthe dashboard effectiveness and adoption by using \nsophisticated algorithms in future. Proposed solution builds non top of rich platform \(Meta layer end users with \nsmooth interaction with reporting, indicators, alerts on their \nown.   \nB Architecture \nAs explained earlier we are mainly concerned about \nfacilitating for stakeholders who are end customers like \ntourist hotel cashiers and Visa officers. Using the solution \nthey should be able to take decisions upfront. Unlike a \nconventional big data solution integrated with a data \nwarehouse, our aim is to integrate with the OLTP system. \nOpen architecture for the proposed dashboard illustrated in \nfigure 01 [31 n \n \nDashboard\nORGANIZE ANALYZE ANDSTORE DECIDEACQUIRE\nUnStructured\nData\nStructured Data\nSemi- Structured\nHDFS Hadoop\nMap Reduce\nMAP  Sqoop\nIndex\nAlgorithms\nApache\nMahout\nHbase\nFigure 1: Architecture Diagram for Big Data Solution \n \n1 Crawling Data from Internet: There are four main sites \nconsidered for personal data extracting. These four sites \nnamed Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+ were \nanalyzed for their behavior below. \n \nThe purpose of web crawling scraping in this project is to \ncollect information about a tourist from social websites in norder to provide information about that particular person to \nthe dashboard. This information feed will provide the \ndashboard with the relevant details of the persons’ behavior \nand habits and will aid the stakeholders in the rating process. \nFollowing are few open source scraping tools based on \njava which was evaluated for this project. \n \n \n \n \n \nJsoup is the main tool that is used here for extracting specific \ndata

This is \ndone inside the crawling algorithm and it will check a proper \ncountry of origin data column from a reputed social network \nengine and shard data according to country of origin. This \nwill be very important as it’s easier to identify similar trends \nand behaviour from tourists in the same country. Natural nLanguage processing algorithms also can be enriched with \ninherent qualities of a certain nation [36]. \n4 MapReduce algorithm to get the indexes: Total Efficiency \nIndex Indicator for tourist is the single indictor that is shown \nin this dashboard as a single value calculated from this \ndashboard which shows the possibility of doing business with \na tourist.  \nx Greater than 75% - high possibility of doing business \nx Greater than 50% - possible and need to incorporate \nstrategies \n Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google + \nTourist \nUsage nTourist \ninformation \nHigh High Low Moderate \nPosts/Tweets \nUpdate \nFrequency \nHigh High Low Low \nAbility to nfind if \naccount is \nverified or \nnot verified \nModerate High Moderate Moderate \nAccuracy of \ninformation \nin posts \n/tweets \nModerate High Low Moderate \nTable 1: Crawling Data from Internet \nTable 2: Scraping tools nScraping \ntools Purpose \nJTidy To use a XML based tool to traverse it. \nJsoup To extract specific data from the HTML \nHtmlUnit To unit test the HTML. \nTagSoup To parse a non-formatted HTML document. \nNekoHTML To parse a HTML document having many mistakes. \nTwitter4J To scrape tweets from twitter. \nRinusha Irudeen #1and Sanjeeva Samaraweera*2  211 \n12th & 13th December 2013     2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions \(ICTer 25% - no possibility of business, not worth \ninvesting \nThis is calculated with several factors and these factors are \ngiven a parameterized weightage. Following is a brief \ndescription of how each factor is calculated. \n \na. Visit Index \nNo of times visited out of country, No of times visited SL \netc has to be counted in the reduce algorithm and added into \ncounters. A  NLP algorithm searches following criteria [19 n[20]. Apache mahout is used as the NLP –machine learning \ntool and some of the key words used in creating knowledge \nbase are as following [21].  \nMax number of visit count is defined as a threshold and \nword count will be counted as a percentage. These values are \ncalculated for current status and will be compared with nprevious values in a graph inside the dashboard.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 4: Parameters for Visit Index \nb.

It derives data from \nmultiple enterprise data sources and integrated with the \nDepartment of Immigration and Emigration database which is \nan OLTP Database. \nData Ingestion layer collects data of current Visa Holders \nfrom different modes including collecting personal \ninformation, Bio metric data, and visa details, flight details \nfrom Department of Immigration and Emigration database \nand collecting social networking data from data sources. \nBasically it proceeds as a centralized repository for user Meta \ndata which is embedded with pre-store social data repository. \nSocial network sites can be utilized to see the potential \nof certain tourists.  \nThe Dashboard's Contextual Search Criteria is based on \ninformation gathering process of proposed solution. It allows \nthe users to define their search criteria. For instance end user \ncan use the given name of a tourist as well as name and \npersonal details. In order to gather accurate information best \nsolution would be to search standard social media web sites \nlike Facebook and LinkedIn. Tourism sites also can be used \nbut it would be less helpful if comments are made \nanonymously.

For an instance, personal details taken \nfrom an integrated OLTP database is crawled. \n \nDashboard enrich with early warning alerts and which is \nbased on the pre-store social data on tourists , information \nwhich is given by tourist himself and any other information \ncommunicated through regulatory institutes. In particularly \nend users can see alerts via dashboard by searching a specific \ntourist. For instance, based on the alerts visa officer can \ndecide whether a tourist can enter the country or not. \nIndex indicators are one of the major functionality in the nproposed dashboard. Initial information gathering process is \ndefined based on information which is available on web. This \nmethod allows extended solution to gather data including \nbasic information, needs, desires and preference of a tourist.  \nSearching information for a particular tourist on web is not \nan easy task. The selection of a unique key is one of the most \ncritical decisions when deciding key criteria. Therefore nconstraints should ensure that the selected keys are unique. \nIn particular, it focuses on the issue of searching tourist \ninformation on web by using only “Name” as key word and \nalso it is a well-known fact that the similar name refers to \na different person. It is not coherent to use only name as \nconstraint when designing Index for the solution. Therefore \nkey criteria defined based on collection of constraints nincluding fields like full name, age, country, address, and \npassport number. That may be useful in cross checking \nalthough it is highly unlikely that a person has published all \nthese details in sites accurately nThe basic information shown for any person like age, race, \ngender, and country are the main details taken Also the \npublished date of any information is very important as \nindexes are compared over the time. \nThe main task in index calculation is to get information for \nthe four indexes. \nx Visit Index \nx Wealth Index \nx Health Index \nx Lifestyle Index \nVisit Index is the probability of a tourist to visit a \nparticular client on his tour. This is mainly done using \nkeywords used in the tourist’s blogs. If a tourist has indicated \nthat he is visiting the client then the visit index becomes 100. \nIf the person has commented that his lifestyle matches with \nclients business and he is visiting Sri Lanka then the visit \nindex is 50. Likewise sophisticated algorithms have to be \ndesigned in order to forecast the probability of a particular \ntourist visiting the client site. \nWealth Index is the index showing his wealth status. If a \nperson has keywords saying his salary is Millions or his \nexpenditure is Millions the index will be increased \naccordingly. Also standard economical sites can be used to \nfind whether this person is listed as a wealthy man we can \nincrease the index. Also his educational qualifications and \nprofessional data are gathered and if he is highly qualified \nand is occupied in a good profession, the index can be \nincreased. \nHealth Index is another index we calculate. Any person’s \nhealth is very important in deciding to select as as an \ninvestment for a particular client.  \nWhile for a health care provider an unhealthy customer \nmay be a better prospect while the normal tourist hotels will \nlook for healthy persons. It is possible to parameterize these \nindexes and its effect on total efficiency index, so a health \ncare provider can customize the calculation accordingly nDepending on the requirement, algorithms involved for the \nnormal tourist care providers can be defined nLifestyle index is another factor that is analysed to \nunderstand the purchase decision patterns of a tourist. Mainly \nthis is the index that is customized according to the tourist \ncare provider. An environment friendly hotel will look for \nenvironment concerned tourists where as an Eastern Food \nspecialist will look for tourists who like Eastern cuisine. Also \na particular client may add more weightage to this index and ninfluence the Total efficiency index more towards lifestyle. \nConsidering each of these four indexes, total efficiency \nindicator is calculated for each tourist. Also the average total \nefficiency indicator is calculated for age, race, gender, \ncountry of a tourist and this is another guideline to compare a \nparticular tourist’s efficiency compared to his peer groups. \nAlso these four indexes as well as the total index are shown \nover the time for a tourist and the trend as well as future \npredictions can be identified from this nFigure 2 Solution Design Process \nData \nsources \n \nStructured Data  Unstructured \nSemi structured Data  \nOLTP Database \nDepartment of Immigration    \nand Emigration \nData Ingestion \nHadoop Hbase \nAnalyze \n Dashboard \n Index Indicators \n Contextual Search \n Centralized repository for user Meta data \n Early Warning Alerts \n Analytic tool and Reports \n Marketing campaign optimization \n Link with social media features  \n Sales and marketing forecasting  \n \nRinusha Irudeen #1and Sanjeeva Samaraweera*2 213 \n12th & 13th December 2013     2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions ICTer 


open architecture. \nBecause it is enrich with Index indicators and big data \ntechnologies such as Hadoop and Hbase.     \nIn addition to gathering information about an individual   \ntourist, end user can track and leverage data on the behaviour \nof tourist based on clickstream data from the web and data on \nhistorical purchases. Basically proposed dashboard can utilize \nas a predictive analytics models to make better decisions, \nreduce risks, to analyse trends, deliver more personal tourist \nexperiences.   \nD.   Analyse and Justification  \n There are number of technologies which were introduced \nwith the evolution of Big Data Database vendors demonstrate \nthe advantages of their products along with hardware and \nsoftware configuration. Therefore it is not easy to choose \nappropriate technology or databases for a particular case nstudy. In order to identify suitable technologies for the \nproposed solution design a brief vendor independent \ncomparison research based on productivity, performance, cost \nand effectiveness is carried out The proposed solution \ndesigned based on Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS Sqoop and Apache Mahout.  \nApache Hadoop is an open-source implication [15], [16]. \nAs a result, the proposed solution can promotes for free \nredistribution and allows access an end solution’s design and \nimplementation One of the benchmark of the proposed \noutput is to design a solution within the budgetary constraints. \nThere should be strategies for collecting massive amounts of \ndata from multiple sources. Hadoop enrich with facilities to \nstore, analyze and access massive amounts of data from \nvariety of sources across clusters of commodity \nhardware[34][35].In addition to that, Hadoop integrated with \ncomponents including Hadoop Distributed File System \n\(HDFS the proposed solution.  Apache \nMahout use as a supporting platform for research and have \nfaced both of these issues in employing it as part of our work \nin collaborative filtering [17]. \nAs explained earlier, contextual search, early warning \nalerts, index indicator features are designed to execute queries \nand other batch read operations beside massive datasets.  \nThus, MapReduce is a high-performance parallel data \nprocessing engine Ideally it is a suitable framework for \nprocessing large amounts of data in parallel on large clusters \nof commodity hardware in a reliable and fault-tolerant \nmanner. With the growth of the data it has ability to npotentially scale up to thousands of nodes [35][39].  \nThe proposed solution enriches with the feature to capture \ntrillions of bytes of information about tourists, and embedded \ninto Social networking data Department of Immigration and \nEmigration database. Therefore solution has an ability to host \nvery large tables, store various types of data including \nstructured, semi-structured and un-structured data. Also it has nto captured, communicated, aggregated, stored, and analyzed. \nHBase provides better solution in this context than other \nNOSQL databases like Cassandra, Voldemort, Redis and \nVoltDB [15] [35].   \nWhen comparing to the scalability of database Hbase \nprovides fault tolerant way of storing large quantities of \nsparse data. Since it has been built on top of HDFS \ndistributed file system and allows fast individual record \nlookups in files with random real-time read or write access to \ndata. HBase provides two run modes including Standalone \nand Standalone HBase and distributed [40] [38]. Depends on \nthe requirement and with the minimum configuration has an \nability to switch between two modes. Each table is stored as a \nmultidimensional sparse map including rows and columns. \nOne of the other major testing is on the performance with \nmajor volumes of data [41]. \nE Extract Data For Dashboard \nEnd user allows making decisions more quickly, has \nvisibility into key metrics across visa details, personal \ninformation, social media details and visualizing accurate \ndata via dashboard They can have a better understanding of \nthe effects of marketing efforts. End users can rely on \nproposed dashboard to as reliable source for finding person \ninformation and obtaining records about them. Find tourist by \ncurrent name, maiden name, address, phone number, or email. \nAlso include a country or city to narrow tourist search \nresults.  It retrieves billions of records to easily locate tourist \nindividually and retrieving data almost instantly.  End users \ncan sign in to preview actual records of each individual.  \nAs mentioned earlier similar name may be refer to \na different person and nearly all email addresses are linked to \nmore than one name. End users allow customize searching \ncriteria depending on their requirement. For an instance if the \nend user selects email address as a searching criteria \ndashboard will show information about every person \nconnected to that particular address. Therefore end user has \noption to select exact person and will retrieve accurate \ninformation. \n \nTRAVEL AND TOURISM  \nLoginCancel\nAlerts\nEmergency\nCustoms Police\nHospital Fire\nAirPort Other\nSuggest Offers !!!\nConnect\nAverage Efficiency\nSearch \nWelcome, Siri n12.5%\nTotal Efficiency Index\nBuying Pattern\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\nUser Login\nFinder Monday, April 15, 2013\nUser Name : ___________\nPassword : ___________\n*First Name Last Name Date of Birth _ _ / _ _ / _ _\nPassport ID\nSocial Security \nNumber\nEmail\nCountry SriLanka\nPhone No\nBackground Check Criminal Records Search Public Records Search Widgets\nAge\n45%\nGender\n70%\n50% off Heritance Kandalama\nDining free california adventure\nAdventure park kitulgala\nAyurveda sakura villa\nRedefine Report\n15%\nMonday, April 15, 2013\nWealth

Also this \ncan search public records associated with that particular \nphone number. Social Security number \(SSN searching criteria to follow individuals' accounts \nwithin the Social Security program. End users can verify ncomprehensive Background Check via dashboard. For \ninstance visa officer can check if anyone has   a criminal nrecord or finding out if someone has gone through bankruptcy \nin their history.  \nBasically dashboard shows everything that should be \nknown about anyone before entering to the country obtaining \nuseful facts before making important decisions. If there is any \nsecurity concern it will show in alert section and display as nsecurity warning alert.  \nTotal Tourist Efficiency index is reflecting the investment \ncapability of a tourist. This index makes clear how efficient a \ntourist as a whole for a purticular client.  \nTotal Efficiency Index = \(Visit Index + Health Index + \nWealth Index + LifeStyle Index Indexes are defined for group of \ntourists of same criteria. Criteria can be age, gender, country \nof residence, ethnicity etc. This is a good indicator to \ncompare individual tourist efficiency with that of the average \nof each criteria he belongs to.  \nAverage Efficiency Index = \(Sum of Total Efficiency \nIndexes of tourists \nBuying pattern is the buying frequency and amount spent in \nwhich a tourist purchase goods or services in a period of time \n \nVI. TESTING  \nOne of the major problems in much invested big data \nprojects is the lack of confidence due to non-practical results. \nTherefore a sound quality control, using standards and a nquality check with comparison testing of results with real web \nsites is very important. During the testing three dimensions \n\(volume, variety and velocity  need to be tested. Test plan has \nbeen proposed as follows;  \n \nA. Validating based on the characteristic of big data \nTesting high volume of data is very complex task and \nneeds faster approach. Testing approach needs to carry out by \nusing number of datasets sampling strategy based on the data \nrequirements. These Structured data needs to test by \ncomparing data using compare tools. Therefore data \ndiscrepancies can be identified Converted semi structured \ndata into structured format since data crawling from different \nwebsite to the dashboard it does not have defined structure to \nvalidate. Subsequently validation should carry out by ncomparing expected data with actual data. There is no define \nformat for unstructured data like social media data, web pages, \nweb log files, search indexes, e-mail, documents. It converted \ninto structured data by using Pig scripting [43] and validated \naggregated data against the data output. Performance testing \nneeds to be out in order to test data speed.  \nB. Functional Testing  \n1 During the \ntesting incorrect data can be captured when loading source \ndata files into HDFS.  Therefore it needs to initially validate \nthe data requirement and compare the input data    file and \nsource data including social data, streaming data, and \nstructured data from OLTP database. Subsequently needs to nvalidate that whether the data files are loaded into HDFS \nappropriately.  \n \n2 Coding issues in map \nreduce jobs can be occurred therefore developers needs to \nhighly concentrate to identify and fix issues. Business logic, \nData process, map reduce process, aggregation, output files \nand file format need to be validated during this phase.  \nThis solution heavily involves java code. It is important \nthat code is written according to java standards and best \npractices to ensure proper functioning of the application. Java \nunit testing of this application is out of scope.  \n \n3 storing phase: Once the data \nfrom data sources loaded in to HDFS and map reduce process \nis completed processed data will move to this phase. Data \ntransformations are very complex and it needs more \nprocessing time. Validation needs to consider in terms of data \nintegrity and data quality. Hence transformation rules and \naggregation of data needs to be validated.  \n    This solution involves inserting and selecting of data from \nNoSQL databases like Hbase. Still there are no hard and fast \nstandards and best practices for NoSQL based data operations. \nEven though it is in the very scope of this paper the time \nfactor has not enabled authors to explore much on this area. \nAuthors plan to explore standards and best practices of \nNoSQL data operations in a future research paper. \n \n4 whether the fetched data appeared as expected.   \nDashboard data and reports needs to be validate by ensuring nwhether web data are up to date and available. \nC. Non Functional Testing \nPerformance Testing is another main area authors need to \npay a lot of attention. Bigdata involves high volumes, high \nvariety and high velocity in data which is vulnerable for \nperformance issues if any of these attributes are changed 


nTherefore millions of data needs to be prepared and loaded \ninto the application and complete cycles needs to be test. Also \nas mentioned earlier there are different varieties of data. \nTherefore data needs to feed to the application in high speed \nsimulating a real world scenario where web pages will rapidly \nupdate. Any issues in performance will rectify from \napplication, hardware, network and other factors continuously \nto get real value from big data \nHDFS architecture is designed to detect and recover to \nproceed with in the processing for three common types of \nfailures including NameNode failures, DataNode failures and \nnetwork failures [44]. However validation should take place \nwhen switch over in to other data node to ensure failover ntesting.   \n \n \n \nD. User Acceptance Testing \(UAT nauthors did lot of work in preparing test specifications as this \nRinusha Irudeen #1and Sanjeeva Samaraweera*2  215 \n12th & 13th December 2013     2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions \(ICTer functionally fit for use and behaves as \nexpected; validate end-to-end business process, user access, \ndata availability, integrity and quality. The method of this \ntesting mainly is on comparing the end result with that of the \nsource web sites. For example let's get a person whose visit \nindex to Sri Lanka is very high Testers have to manually \naccess the web sites involved and see whether they reflect \nthese visits. Also they have to compare this with different \nusers and see whether the visit index for this user is \nreasonable compared to web published data and other users. \nIn this way all the indexes has to be tested with sample users \nand also see whether average indexes are realistic and also \nother trends are correctly shown in web nVII. DISCUSSION \nAs discussed in the paper this research was based mainly \non the end users like tourist hotels and tourist guides etc. \nTherefore it was essential that we get the feedback from them \non the solution design as well. We got their feedback mainly \nfrom the dashboard prototype which was a very good tool for nthem to get good idea on our design. \nUsers were very enthusiastic on this kind of a solution. \nTheir main worry was whether they will have to pay for this \napplication. They knew that we were based on readily navailable data in internet and some of them were already \nusing some web pages to get an idea of their tourists. So it \nwas not an easy task to convince a new application. But the \nrich interface and the comparative indexes authors designed \nwere making sense to them. After looking at the return on \ninvestment most of them were happy on this venture. \nOne of the main valid points was whether we can rely on \nweb data As they pointed out some of them had relied on \nthese web information earlier and had mixed results. Some ntourists sites were publishing genuine data where as some \nothers were publishing fake data which we also had to agree. \nTherefore what they were pointing was rather than relying on \ndata that is published by tourist themselves we have to go for \nsome independently confirmed data source, since they have to \nsubscribe also Authors pointed out the facility of integration \nwith the Department of Immigration and Emigration which nusers welcomed and were suggesting further to get integrated \nwith official authorities of countries of relevant tourist as well. \nThis was a good suggestion and authors think this is possible \nif they can get the sponsorship from government of Sri Lanka \non this venture. \nBigdata solutions mainly go hand in hand with ndatawarehousing solutions. Software companies market them \nas cheap options for datawarehousing due to the open source \nstack it uses. But penetrating into the market with this \nstrategy is difficult when there is an existing datawarehousing \nsolution. Client thinks he already has the given solution using \nthe datawarehousing data and if he has already spent on \nsoftware he may not be interested in going for a new solution. \nDue to this problems in penetrating into the market with \ndatawarehosing solutions authors came up with this novel nidea of integrating bigdata solutions to On Line Transaction \nProcessing Solutions. Rather than marketing this as a \nManagement Information System authors are proposing to get \nadditional data using this solution for front office transaction \nsystems. \n One of the main attractive points in this solution is rather \nthan working on historical data of the available databases \nauthors is going for social media to explore additional and \nindependent data. This was the main key factor in introducing \nbigdata into tourist sector as this impressed the tourist \noperators. Even though this data is known to the end user they \nreadily accepted the way authors were trying to analyze this. \n Even though bigdata is a buzzword the use of it is very \nlimited and this a practical solution design which will attract \nusers to use this technology. \nAuthors' idea was to implement this solution design before \nthe ICTer conference for the presentation. But due to other \nfull time commitments they did not have time to show a fully \nexecutable prototype of this solution. Especially both authors \nbeing database specialists it was no easy task for them to start \non a venture of a java based project. Therefore the solution \nwill be limited to the total solution design with fully tested \nhadoop and hbase components. \nWe would have validated the data files in different data \nnodes in order to complete the validating process during the \ndata crawling and scraping phrase. In the testing, we mainly \ntested standalone 


node only. Different issues may occurred \nwhen validating the map reduce process run on multiple \nnodes nVIII. CONCLUSIONS \n In this paper we proposed a solution design for a \ndashboard which is integrated with big data technologies. \nDifferent types of big data technologies were analyzed and \nidentified. After evaluating stakeholder requirement and \npossibility of implementation proposed solution were \ndesigned based on Hadoop nFour fusion logics were applied to design main index \nindicators. Index Indicators, Contextual Search Centralized \nrepository for user Meta data, Early Warning Alerts, Analytic \ntool and Reports, Marketing campaign optimization, Link \nwith social media features, Sales and marketing forecasting \nare the main functionalities will be embedded in the proposed \ndashboard.  \nThe proposed personal dashboard enriches with ncustomized features and enables end user to get summarized \ninformation about a tourist from different sources. On other \nhand it is very useful to take decisions in various aspects. The \nconcept has been applied in one of Sri Lanka’s most \nemerging industry named, travel and tourism to show the \npracticality of this technology to anybody. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nOur gratitude is expressed to Database Competency \nExcellence Group DB-CEG POC expertise coding knowledge in implementing the \nsolution. \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] T.Lock \(2012 Big Data \nrevolution.[Online].Available:http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/0\n8/big_data_revolution/ \n[2 R.Henschke. \(2009  nhttp://www.asiacalling.org/en/special-reports/after-the-war-the-hard-\nwork-begins-in-sri-lanka/1441-sri-lanka calls-for-tourism-\ndevelopment-boom \n[3] J.Manyika, M.Chui, B.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
