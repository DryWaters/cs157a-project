Focusing at the application level, this paper\nproposes a method to support the process design by optimizing\nthe con?guration and deployment. In particular, measuring and\nmonitoring suitable metrics, the presented approach provides a\nsupport to the designer to select the way in which it is possible to\nmodify the process deployment in order to continuously guarantee\ngood performance and energy ef?ciency. The process adaptation\ncan be required when inef?ciencies occur or when, although the\nsystem is ef?cient, there is still room for improvements.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNowadays, researchers are more and more analyzing the\nevolution and diffusion of cloud computing from a perspective\non sustainability. Assessments of the environmental impact of\ncloud computing reveal that data centers consume an extremely\nhigh amount of electricity [1]. Many contributions show that\nthe reduction of CO2 emissions, and energy consumption can\nbe achieved by considering several initiatives such as the\nreduction of the cooling power consumption, the utilization of\ngreen energy sources, server consolidation and virtualization,\nand the utilization of greener machines. In the proposed\napproaches, less attention has been paid to the analysis of\nthe impact of the design and deployment of the running\napplications on energy ef?ciency.\nConsidering this application viewpoint, in this paper we\npropose an approach for the optimization of the application\ndesign and deployment. The optimization is driven by three\nmain factors: energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and the\nsatisfaction of performance requirements measured by suitable\nmetrics. The idea is to follow a process design life-cycle\nwhere ?rstly, a business process \(BP of\nthe system and of the designer expertise. Then, the system\ncontinuously monitors the application in order to evaluate\nif the requirements are satis?ed or if there is anyway room\nfor improving the considered metrics If changes are needed,\nthe designer should enact appropriate adaptation actions, that\nwill take place in the next execution of the BP and that are\nable to address the discovered inef?ciencies, by modifying\nthe workload distribution between different versions of the\nconsidered BP. The approach described in this paper aims to\nsupport the designer in the interpretation of the monitoring\nresults and in the selection of the adaptation action.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses\nprevious contributions and highlights the innovative aspects of\nthe presented approach. Section III provides a general overview\nof the approach that is formalized in the following sections:\nSection IV focuses on the process design and deployment\nphases, Section V introduces the relevant metrics, Section VI\ndescribes the method that supports the designer in the selection\nof the adaptation action able to optimize the process in terms\nof performance and energy ef?ciency Finally, Section VII\nvalidates the approach with an example and Section VIII\noutlines some possible future work.\nII. RELATED WORKS\nEnergy ef?ciency and the control of CO2 emissions are a\nliving matter and, in the recent years, many researcher have\naddressed these aspects at very different granularity levels. The\nmain issue when dealing with energy ef?ciency and CO2 emis-\nsions consists in ?nding a direct or indirect way to measure\nthem. Moreover, the improvement in energy ef?ciency and\nthe CO2 emissions reduction cannot overlook the impact over\nperformance. A tradeoff between greenness and performance\nhas to be handled in order to respect functional requirements\nof the provided services. Metrics for describing these two\naspects have been formalized in [2] and in [3]. In the former\nwork, the well known Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs for\nevaluating Quality of Service \(QoS Ecological Indicators \(KEIs GPIs with a role similar to the KEIs. In [4],\nauthors put lights on the importance of considering also how\nthe available resources are used in the delivery of the service,\nintroducing usage centric metrics to this extent This concept is\ndeveloped also in [5], where usage centric metrics are de?ned\nat the server and the virtual machine level.\nMeasuring energy is not an easy task, especially when real\ntime data are required and when energy has to be measured\nfor each single server separately. Several approaches consider\nCPU as the principal contributor to power usage in a server\nand propose models for computing energy starting from the\namount of CPU used on the server [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]. These\nmodels compute power usage using a linear relation between\nCPU usage and power consumption. Parameters of the model\nare the power consumption values for the server when idle\nand when at the peak load. The only variable of the model\nis the CPU load. It has been demonstrated that even a linear\napproximation of this model is effective in estimating the real\npower consumption [11]. An 


interesting aspect is that even in\nidle state a server consumes more than the 60% of its peak load\npower. This is why an optimization, even at the application\nlevel can signi?cantly contribute to the improvement of energy\nef?ciency and consequently to the reduction of CO2 emissions,\nby optimizing the way in which resources are used.\n2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Cloud and Green Computing\n978-0-7695-5114-2/13 $26.00 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CGC.2013.77\n451\nStep 4.

Energy-aware process design optimization approach\nSome studies face the problem of energy ef?ciency and\ngreenness with a focus at the process level. In [12], authors\nstate that an improvement is possible only if the approach in-\ncludes a process re-engineering step. Four areas of intervention\nare identi?ed: process design, measuring, improvement and\nchange, and implementation. Other approaches use process\nannotation: the business process is enriched with additional\ninformation regarding its behavior in terms of energy ef?-\nciency [2] [13]. In [14], the authors de?ne a set of patterns\nfor improving energy ef?ciency of a BP by adding a green\ndimension to the traditional four dimensions: cost, time, ?ex-\nibility and quality. Other scholars focus their attention on\nrecon?guration of the service. The general approach consists\nin decomposing the process in sub-tasks that can be substituted\nwith similar but greener ones [15] [16] [17].\nThe approach proposed in our paper has been inspired by\nthe service composition and evolution as we aim to consider\nvariants and adaptation of the tasks that compose a service-\nbased business process, also considering green aspects. The\nevaluation is based on the estimation of the workload of each\ntask. Given the workload, we will use a small selection of\nthe metrics de?ned in literature to assess the state of the\nsystem and to compare different solutions in terms of energy\nef?ciency, CO2 and QoS. On the basis of these evaluations and\na set of possible actions to enact for improving the process\ndesign and deployment, we support the designer decision\nprocess: we alert designers if improvements are needed and\nwe also suggest the appropriate changes to apply.\nIII. PROPOSED APPROACH\nThe optimization of the design of energy-aware BP follows\nthe cycle shown in Fig. 1. First of all, we assume that the\napplication designer already knows which are the tasks that a\nprocess should perform and the order in which these tasks have\nto be executed \(Step 1 processes composed of different tasks\nrunning on Virtual Machines \(VMs concerns the con?guration of such VMs \(Step\n2 cloud infrastructure \(Step 3 this\npaper, as we rely on solutions that have been proposed in\nthe literature \(e.g., [18] [19] [20 VMs of the\nprocess have been deployed, the execution commences and\nthe monitoring system starts gathering information about the\nprocess in terms of performance and energy impact \(Step 4 by measuring speci?c metrics\n\(e.g., CPU usage, response time, energy consumption execution, the monitored data combined with the\nsupported adaptation actions will drive the optimization of the\nBP \(Step 5 intervene by means of adaptation\nactions when changes are required \(for instance, when terms\nin Service Level Agreement are no longer satis?ed ways. In fact, we consider a BP with different tasks\nthat can be assigned to different VMs adopting various con?g-\nurations. The BP execution could be changed in different ways.\nFor example, it is possible to modify the VMs con?guration or\nthe way in which the tasks of the process are deployed on the\nVMs, it is also possible to duplicate or remove duplicated VMs\nand reallocate the workload. More details about the actions that\nwe consider in this paper are provided in Sec. IV.\nThe plethora of possible actions makes dif?cult the decision\nof the application designers. Indeed, they should select the\nmore favorable adaptation action in terms of performance\nand energy ef?ciency but such decision requires a complete\nknowledge of the impact that the execution of the different\nadaptation actions has on the system \(i.e., monitored metrics approach aims to support the designer in such\na decision making process by suggesting the most suitable\nadaptation action. The decision is based on estimations based\non previous executions. The methodology used to achieve this\ngoal is described in details in the following sections, according\nto the ?ve steps identi?ed in Fig. 1.\nIV. PROCESS DESIGN AND DEPLOYMENT\nThe ?rst phase consists in the design and deployment of\nthe BP and includes the ?rst three steps shown in Fig. 1.\nA business process BP is a collection of tasks Ti} which\nare executed providing a valuable output. Tasks are linked\nby control structures \(e.g., sequence choice, parallel that re?ects the typical interaction\nof the user with the process. It is usually obtained from the\nanalysis of 


historical data derived from previous executions.\nIn case of ?rst execution these values will be de?ned by the\napplication designer based on his/her experience.\nBP = {?Ti, Pi?}\nAssuming that WLBP is the total workload of the business\nprocess, the workload for each task is given by:\nWLTi = WLBP · Pi\nIt is necessary to consider that for the execution of each\ntask, one or more variants are available, i.e. functionally\nequivalent tasks As the workload of the task can be distributed\namong the variants, the percentage of workload that will be\nassigned to each variant is de?ned as:\nTi = {ti,j} = {?Vi,j , Di,j?} where\n?\nj Di,j = 1\nwhere ti,j is a variant of the task, Vi,j is the con?guration of\nthe VM hosting the task andDi,j is the percentage of workload\nof the task Ti assigned to the variant ti,j .\n452\nA con?guration of a task variant consists of a speci?c\ncon?guration of the VM on which the task runs. This means\nthat the same task can run on different VMs:\nVi,j = ?qCPU, qRAM, qStorage?\nwhere qCPU , qRAM , and qStorage indicates the number\nof CPUs, the amount of memory, and the amount of storage\navailable for the VM on which the task runs.\nIn our approach, the distribution among the variants of the\nsame task, is supported by the optimization algorithm proposed\nSec. VI This distribution will affect the workload submitted\nto each variant for a given task as:\nWLti,j = WLTi Di,j\nIn the process deployment phase, each variant ti,j is\nassigned to a dedicated VMi,j , taking into account its con-\n?guration Vi,j :\nti,j\nassigned to???????? VMi,j\nand each VM is than deployed on a physical server PHl:\nVMi,j\ndeployed on????????? PHl\nAs a consequence of the adoption of variants at task level,\nalso variants at business process level can be de?ned as the\napplication of one or more adaptation actions Az . An action Az\nis a complex action originated from the composition of one or\nmore atomic actions over the BP. An action can be expressed\nas Az = {az,v}, where az,v has an impact on a single\ntask belonging to the business process. We can de?ne atomic\nactions as az,v ? {Add\(ti,x ti,x ti,y, ti,x ti,x T ?i where T ?i = Ti ? ti,x ?\n?\nj D\n?\ni,j = 1\nDel\(ti,x 1\nMod\(ti,y, ti,x ti,y ti,x be\nconsidered as the application designer can decide to avoid any\nmodi?cations.\nThus, applying a composite action Az to a business process\nBP we obtain a variant BP ? consisting in a different set of\ntask variants and in a different workload distribution among\nthem: i.e., BP Az??? BP ?z . Thus, the goal of the optimization\ndescribed in Sec. VI is to identify the variant that better\nimproves both the performances of the process and the en-\nergy ef?ciency assessed by using the metrics introduced in\nSection V.\nV. PROCESS EXECUTION AND MONITORING\nMonitoring is fundamental to gather data about perfor-\nmance and energy ef?ciency of an application. Such properties\nare inferred by measuring speci?c metrics. In details, the set\nof metrics considered in this work includes:\n• VM resource usage parameters: CPU and memory\nutilization percentages for a running application over\na run time interval are calculated by using the ratio be-\ntween the amount of used and allocated CPU/memory.\nThe resource usage parameters also include IOPS that\nis de?ned as the total number of I/O operations per\nsecond.\n• Throughput: number of performed transactions over a\nperiod of time.\n• Energy consumption: refers to the energy consumed\nby the application in a speci?c period of time.\n• CO2 emissions quantity of CO2 emitted by executing\nthe speci?c application.\n• Application performance: is the ratio between the\nthroughput of the VM in a certain time interval and\nthe energy consumed.\n• Response time: refers to the time spent to serve a\nsingle request.\nMore formally, each metric can be modeled as:\nmh =< name, V > \(1 the name identi?es the metric and V corresponds to the\nset of admissible values. It is represented by its extremes, i.e.,\nV = [vmin, vmax].\nMetrics can be collected at the BP level or at the VM/task\nvariant level For each of these levels, users can operate a\nrestriction on the admissible range of values for eachmh, in or-\nder to require a speci?c energy consumption, or performance.\nThis restriction can be formalized as:\nrh\(c mh, req, w > \(2 on the range of admissible\nvalues for metric mh computed over the component c. This\nrestriction corresponds to the values required by the user\nfor the given metric. Finally w ? [0, 1] is the weight that\nde?nes the relevance of the metric for the speci?c user \(or\napplication requirements.\nSuch requirements and constraints can be used to derive the\ninitial deployment of applications as well as provide impetus\nfor run-time adaptation of application deployment. Note that\nthe constraints can be hard constraints if the user considers\nthat they must be satis?ed or soft constraints if the user also\naccepts a constraint violation. Note that for the hard constraint\nthe relevance weight will be rh\(c the soft\nconstraints rh\(c c to desired \(satisfaction zone alarm zone de?ned slightly before the alarm zone, and its range of\nvalues is identi?ed automatically on the basis of the designer\nrequirements. In fact, such a range of values depends on\nthe strategy that the designer wants to adopt for the system\nimprovement. Two possible approaches are possible: proactive\nand reactive. Adopting a 


proactive approach implies that a\nwarning is triggered before reaching a real violation, so that\nthe system can react in advance. It requires the usage of an\nextended warning zone between the satisfaction and the alarm\nzone. On the contrary, using a reactive approach implies a\nwarning zone very close to the alarm threshold. In this case the\n453\nAlarm\nzone\nWarning\nzone\nSatisfaction\nzone\nAlarm\nzone\nWarning\nzone\nThresholdMin ThresholdMax\nFig. 2. Variables requirements restriction intervals\nsystem reacts only when it is signi?cantly close to a violation.\nA general representation of the three zones for the metrics is\nshown in Fig. 2, even if for some metrics either ThresholdMin\nor ThresholdMax can be de?ned.\nVI. PROCESS OPTIMIZATION\nIn the approach presented in this paper, inef?cient situa-\ntions are addressed by an adaptive behavior. The selection of\nthe best adaptation action to trigger requires performing two\nsequential steps: a local and a global optimization.\nLocal optimization\nThis step requires the analysis of each process variant BP ?z\nin order to de?ne the way in which the workload should be\ndistributed among the tasks de?ned in the process variants In\nfact, since the BP variants mainly consist in adding or deleting\ntask variants, a redistribution of the workload is always needed.\nSuch redistribution should be performed by considering that\nthe workload has an impact on all the metrics considered\nin this paper. This statement is con?rmed by existence of a\ndocumented positive correlation between workload and CPU\nload [21]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that CPU load\nis directly proportional to the response time [7], the energy\nconsumption \(see Sec. II consequence, the CO2\nemissions and application performance. The existence of a\ncorrelation between the workload distribution and memory and\nIOPS depends on the analyzed business process. Anyway, it is\npossible to af?rm that a change in the workload distribution\naffects such two variables only in two ways: \(i metrics\nare unaltered \(there are no dependencies with the workload ii workload in a directly\nproportional way.\nOn the basis of these considerations, our goal is to ?nd the\nset of workload distributions for each task variant {WLti,j}\nthat maximizes the following optimization function:\nmax F \({WLti,j WLti,j 3 related to the minimization of\nemissions and energy consumption. They are calculated as the\ndifference between the quantity of emissions and consumed\nenergy before and after the execution of the BP variant. The\nnumber of satis?ed soft requirements \(SSR relevance\nfor the users. The optimization problem should be solved\nby considering the hard constraints that must be satis?ed to\nguarantee the system effectiveness and ef?ciency.\nThe solution of the optimization problem WL?ti,j} is the\nvector of workload distribution on the different tasks and re-\nlated variants that maximize the de?ned function. Such vector\nwill be calculated for each considered adaptation action Az .\nIn this way we will have Z workload vectors and, considering\nsuch vectors, we store in the decision matrix DM the vector\nXz that contains the estimated values of the three attributes of\nfunction F after the execution of the adaptation strategy \(that\nis in correspondence of the workload vector {WL?ti,j WL?ti,j CO2\({WL?ti,j WL?ti,j c WL?ti,j 4 optimization aims to identify the best adaptation\naction to perform in order to maximize the goal function\namong the {Az} set. We consider techniques from the Multiple\nCriteria Decision Making theory [22 Each alternative is asso-\nciated with a vector Xz that contains the three estimated values\nof the attributes after the execution of the adaptation strategy\nAz . Such estimation can be performed on the basis of the\nresults of previous executions as discussed later in this section.\nThe different vectors compose the decision matrix DM that\nsupports us in the strategy selection. The selection is carried\nout by executing two main steps. First of all, the elimination\nof all the dominated solutions is required. A solution Xm is\ndominated if there is another solution which has better results\nfor all the considered attributes Xk: Xk,n Xm,n for each n\n\(where n is the considered attribute and n ? {1, 2, 3} in our\ncase solution. The decision broker\nwill consider all the non-dominated alternative solutions. As a\n?rst step, all the attributes are normalized in the range of values\n[0, 1], so that they are comparable even if expressing different\ngoals. Then, the selection of the most suitable alternative can\nbe performed by using one of the following methods [22]:\n• MAXIMIN rule: for each non-dominated solution Xz ,\nthe attribute with the lowest value is identi?ed. Results\nfor all the solutions are compared and the one with the\nhighest “lowest value” is preferred.\n• MAXIMAX rule: for each non-dominated solution\nXz , the attribute with the highest value is identi?ed.\nResults for all the solutions are compared and the one\nwith the highest “highest value” is preferred.\n\nBoth global and local optimizations rely on the computa-\ntion of the application independent terms, i.e., ?CO2, ?E,\nand application dependent terms, i.e., the number of soft\nconstraints that can be satis?ed.\nApplication independent estimation\nThe estimation of energy consumption and CO2 emissions\nare considered application independent as these parameters\nmainly depend on the CPU load. For this reason, we can 


esti-\nmate these two parameters analyzing physical servers having\nthe same average CPU load of the application that we are\n454\ngoing to deploy, regardless of the applications that are actually\nrunning.\nIn order to evaluate the factor ?E\({WLti,j variant ti,j in order to ?nd the relationships between\nworkload and CPU load. Thus, given a WLti,j we retrieve\nthe correspondent CPULoad\(ti,j physical host PHl \(i.e.,\npeak power power consumed by a similar task\ndeployed on a similar host. Such a similarity is computed\nby comparing the CPU load of the analyzed task and the\ncharacteristics of the host where it runs, to the hystorical data\nof the hosts usage, looking for hosts with similar characteristics\nthat run applications with a similar CPU load.\nThe evaluation of the CO2 emissions is based on the\nemission factors \(gCO2e/kWh grids.\nConsidering the consumed energy E\(ti,j the emission\nfactor.\nApplication dependent estimation\nIn this section we estimate the last part of the objective\nfunction described in Eq. 3, i.e., the number of metrics that\nwill be satis?ed SSR.\nAs before, we try to predict the trends of the state of\nthe variables for a given distribution of the load between the\navailable variants of each task. In this case we can not use\nthe similarity criteria introduced in the previous paragraph.\nIn fact, the value of the variables is strictly dependent on\nthe application and it is very unlikely to ?nd examples of\nthe variables behaviors in historical data for all the possible\ncon?gurations of the process.\nInstead of using similarity, we propose an alternative tech-\nnique based on correlations between variables. To this extent,\nwe build a Bayesian Network [23]. This network expresses\ndependencies among variables using a directed acyclic graph\nrepresentation, where a parent-child relation between two\nnodes de?nes a causal dependency of the child from the\nparent. A Conditional Probability Table \(CPT node\nexpresses the probability for the node to get each one of the\nallowed values given the state of its parents. A conditional\nindependence relation among variables representable as nodes\nin a Bayesian Network is also de?ned [23]:\nDe?nition 1: the conditional independence property be-\ntween nodes in a Bayesian Network implies that a node is\nindependent on all other nodes given its parents, children and\nchildren’s parents.\nThese properties of a Bayesian Network allow a simple\ninference mechanism for predicting the most likely state of a\nsubset of variables given the state of all the other nodes in the\nnetwork.\nThe usefulness of a Bayesian Network representation for\nour problem is twofold. First of all, it allows us to establish\ndependence and independence relations among variables. In\nthis way, if we know that a subset of variables changes, we\ncan predict which are the variables that will be in?uenced and\nG1\nG2\nG3\nG5 G4\nP\(G4=S G2=S, G3=S G4=S | G2=W, G3=W G4=S | G2=A, G3=A G4=S | G2=W G2=S | G2=A G4=W G2=A  G1=S G1=S G1=A G2=S | G1=S G2=S | G1=W G2=S | G1=A G2=W G2=W Bayesian Network expressing relations among variables states\nwhich are the ones that remain the same. This allows us to\nrestrict the problem and to focus only on a subset of variables.\nSecond, even if the network is not able to predict the exact\nvalue of the variables, it can be used to predict future states of\nthe requirements. In order to use a Bayesian Network repre-\nsentation, variables have to be transformed into discrete values,\nrepresenting the satisfaction of the requirements de?ned over\nthem \(see Sec. V and Eq. 2 particular, each variable will\nbe expressed with 1 out of 5 values indicating if it is satis?ed\n\(satisfaction zone alarm zone warning zone shown\nin Fig. 2. As an example, the CPU load has two alarm and\nwarning intervals, since it can be violated either if its value is\ntoo high or too low. Indeed, if the CPU usage of a server is too\nlow, it is inef?ciently used, while if it is too high it can have a\nnegative impact on performance. An example of a Bayesian\nnetwork for our context is shown in Fig. 3 1, where each\nnode is a variable and the CPTs contain parent dependent state\nprobabilities for each node. Through the Bayesian Network,\nwe are able to predict future states of the variables given the\nmodi?cations in the states of other variables.\nThe ?rst step consists in building the network, by discover-\ning the relations among variables. Most of the time, Bayesian\nNetworks are manually created by experts. However, several\ntechniques are available in the state of the art to learn it\nfrom historical values of the monitored variables. Here we\nuse an approach similar to the one described in 24] to learn\nthe structure of the network. Then, we learn CPTs using a\nMaximum a Priori Estimation approach 25].\nOnce the network is created, it can be used to evaluate\na particular variant of the process. The evaluation procedure\nstarts when a request arrives. The input of the evaluation\nprocess is a set of values of CPU load for the tasks that we\nwant to modify. In order to estimate future values, we use the\ninference properties of the Bayesian Network. The input of the\ninference has to be the set of values for all the nodes in the\nnetwork where the values of the node that we want to estimate\nare hidden. So, starting from the input 


the algorithm works as\nfollows:\n1 5 using the de?ned require-\nments.\n2 I are selected using the conditional in-\ndependence rules of a Bayesian Network \(see Def. 1 Satisfaction Zone, W = Warning Zone, A = Alarm Zone\n455\n3 proce-\ndure is de?ned as follows:\n• take the vector with the state of the variables\nobtained by the monitoring system.\n• modify the values of the variables in I with\nthe values computed at step 1.\n• hide the variables in V from the vector.\n4 variable in V associ-\nated with a probability PV for the variable to get that\nstate.\n5 binary vector InfInput? obtained\nfrom InfInput. A value equals to 1 means that the\nrequirements upon the variable are satis?ed, while a\nvalue equals to 0 means that they are violated. An\nadditional vector Conf of the same dimension is\nalso created with the values PV for each predicted\nvariable. The probability value for all the variables\nthat do not belong to V will be 1, because they are\nconsidered as constant.\nThe probability value returned by the inference procedure\nis used as a con?dence parameter in the estimation of the value\nfor the third attribute of the optimization function.\nVII. VALIDATION\nTo provide a validation of our approach, we consider a\nsample BP \(see Fig. 4 site. This BP involves\nseveral VMs where the tasks are installed and executed. Using\nthe notation introduced in Sec. IV, our BP is de?ned as:\nBP = {?BS, 1.0?, ?RO, 0.90?, ?V O, 0.95?, \(5 0.045?}\nTo execute the business process and monitor the metrics intro-\nduced in Section III, we relied on the BonFIRE infrastructure2.\nFor the sake of simplicity, and considering that the BonFIRE\nplatform is not now able to monitor the energy related metrics\nand the I/O usage:\n• As the memory usage does not change signi?cantly\nduring the experiment, in this validation we focus on\nthe CPU Usage.\n• For the energy-related metrics, we rely on the results\npublished in [8] to estimate the power of a physical\nhost based on the CPU load.\n• We assume that each task of the BP lives on a\ndedicated VM and that the resulting VMs are deployed\non different physical hosts.\n• Although on a physical host, in addition to our VMs,\nother VMs of other applications are running, we\nassume that the CPU load of these external VMs\nremains constant as we are interested in the variation\nof consumption of our business process.\n• The VMs can be hosted on data centers sited in France\nand England where the average CO2 emission fac-\n2http://www.bon?re-project.eu/\ntors are respectively, 146 gCO2e/kWh 3 and 567.17\ngCO2e/kWh 4.\nThe two possible con?gurations of the VM used for our\nvalidation are:\n• VM2,2 = ? 2 cores, 2 GBytes, 10Gbytes ?.\n• VM4,4 = ? 4 cores, 4 GBytes, 10Gbytes nwhere a Linux Debian Squeeze v.5 distribution is installed,\nalong with Oracle Glass?sh v3.1 to run the activities compos-\ning our BP.\nCreating the Bayesian Network\nThe creation of the Bayesian Network requires a knowledge\nabout previous executions of the BP. At least during the ?rst\ndesign of our BP this kind of information is not available.\nNevertheless, as common behavior in case of service-based\nbusiness processes, we can assume that other instances of the\nsame tasks composing our BP have been previously used in\nother processes.\nStarting from the historical data collected from the moni-\ntoring system, and using the procedure described in Sec. VI,\nwe obtain a Bayesian Network describing the relations among\nvariables in the system. We consider to have metrics at two\nlevels:\n• Task Level: metrics at this level are CPU load \(CPU throughput \(TH RT level are response time \(RT TH AP network obtained for the considered example is shown\nin Fig. 5, representing a simpli?ed version of the real network.\nIn the picture, only a general task is represented, while in the\nreal network the same structure is replicated for each of the\ntasks and their variants in the BP. In our example, we have\nsix tasks. The response time of all the tasks and their variants\ncontribute to the response time of the whole process, and the\nsame can be stated for the throughput.\nInitial con?guration\nThe application designer decides to initially run the six\ntasks on six VMs having the same con?guration \(i.e., the\nVM2,2 does not add\nany variant, so the workload of a given task is entirely sent to\nthe unique available VMs thus:\nBS = RO = V O = RP = IP = CA = ?VM2,2, 1.0?\nAs hard constraint, we have RT \(BP soft\nconstraints, we have:\n• ?

According to the adaptation mechanisms\npresented in Section IV, the application designer plans to\nmodify the con?guration of the BS task by doubling both\nthe number of CPUs and the amount of memory to a BS?\nvariant, i.e.:\nBS? = ?VM4,4, 1.0?\nAs we assume that in France there are no available VMs\nwhich such features, this task will run in England. So, the\nactions that the application designer takes into account are\nMod\(BS,BS application designer proposes only this\nvariant, the solution of the local optimization \(see Eq. 3 such a variant and all the workload for the ?rst task of\nthe BP is sent to BS?. Indeed, what we would like to demon-\nstrate in this validation is how the enactment of an adaptation\naction can in?uence the values of the monitored metrics. As a\nconsequence, the two alternatives to be considered are XNop\nand XMod.\nAbout the alternative XNop the values for the ?CONop2 ,\n?ENop result 0, since no modi?cation has been done to the\nprocess and this does not affect the energy metrics. About the\nnumber of satis?ed soft constraints, these values are computed\nconsidering the data monitored during the previous execution\nand constraints over the indicators. About CPU usage, only the\n?rst task satis?es the given constraints, while constraints about\nresponse time and throughput at the task level are satis?ed for\nall tasks except for the ?rst one in which response time is\nhigher than the constraint and throughput is lower. At the BP\nlevel, throughput is not satis?ed and the same for application\nperformance.\nThe computation of the values for the alternative XMod\nfollows the application independent and dependent estimation.\nThese estimations are based on the monitoring data associated\nwith previous execution of the tasks composing our BP that,\nas previously said, can be done for other instances in different\nprocesses. The result of this estimation is reported in the third\ncolumn of Table I \(i.e., “Estimation energy\nconsumed by the application requires the knowledge of the\nCPU load. Looking at the data about previous executions, we\nsearch for instances of BS task running on a VM4,4 and\nwe discover that, having the same workload as in the initial\nexecution: \(i and \(ii the remaining tasks. For this reason, following the\nstructure of the BP , we analyze the previous executions to\nestimate the CPU load given the new workload. For instance,\nhaving a BS faster by 20% means that the workload rate\nfor the RO increases of the same amount \(the effect of the\nbranch is considered insigni?cant and looking at the data, we\nunderstand how, under this circumstances, the CPU load for\nthe RO double \(from 20.84% to 41.68 know it is invoked very rarely for which the\nCPU load remains unchanged. For the sake of simplicity these\nestimations are intentionally rough as a real estimation requires\na lot of assumptions and data available to the application\ndesigner. For this reason, in the real scenario, we can assume\nthat such data along with the experience of the designer, will\nresult in a more accurate estimation. Having the CPU load for\neach of the tasks, the computation of the energy consumed by\nthe application follows the assumptions in 8].\nExploiting the Bayesian Network computed starting from\nthe monitored data \(see Fig. 5 number of\nsatis?ed indicators for the CPU loads estimated in column 3\nof Tab.

FINAL REMARKS\nIn this paper we presented an approach for supporting the\nenergy-aware adaptation of business processes at design time\ndriven by an optimization problem that takes into account both\ninfrastructural, applicative, and environmental standpoints. In\nparticular, the adaptation actions available to the application\ndesigner rely on the de?nition of variants for the tasks com-\nposing the business process.\nThis approach is now heavily based on the assumption that\nmonitored data about previous executions are available, and\ninformation able to give the values for the interesting metrics\nare all included in this knowledge base. For future development\nof our approach, we aim to relax this assumption, trying to\nunderstand if we can infer the values of the metrics in case\nthe data needed to compute them analytically are not present.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work has been supported by the ECO2Clouds project\n\(http://eco2clouds.eu activity of the 7th Framework\nProgramme under contract number 318048.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Greenpeace, “How Clean Is Your Cloud?,” tech. rep., 04 2012.\n[2] A.

PARTITIONING SCHEME \nIn this section, we describe some additional details of the \npartitioning schemes. For a given n nodes and P processors, \nwe create P partitions Vo, V1 , . . .  Vp-1 . The processors are \nlabeled as 0, 1 ,  . . .  P - 1. Partition Vi is processed by pro­\ncessor i. For each scheme, we need to know i of nodes in each partition, and iii Below we show how to calculate them for the three \npartitioning schemes. \nA.1 Uniform Consecutive Partitioning UCP assigned to the par­\ntitions. \nPartition size: The sizes of the partitions are almost equal. \nLet B = I f5 l Then, the size of a partition is either B or \nB -1. \nPartition range: Partition i includes the nodes from iB nto \(i  + I III J . \nA.2 Linear Consecutive Partitioning \(LCP par­\ntitions, and the number of nodes in the partitions are mod­\neled by arithmetic progression a, a+d, a+2d a+\(P- l are partition pal'ame­\nters. At the end of this section, we discuss how a and d are \ndetermined. \nPartition range: Partition i has the nodes from L;:? \(a+ \njd 2a+\(?-1 a + jd i + 1 2a?id 1 .  \nFinding processor rank: Given a node u ,  we need to \nfind the partition i such that u E Vi, Node u satisfies the \nfollowing inequality: \ni-I \nl 2a + \(i - l i + 1 2a id 11 pa­\nrameters a and d are determined using the number of nodes \nn and the number of processors P. Parameter d 


is the slope \nof the straight line y = a + dx, where y represent the num­\nber of nodes in the processor with rank x = i. We calcu­\nlate d by finding two points on this straight line. Putting \ni = 0 and i = P -1 in Eqn 10, we can compute nl and \nnp- l .  Then, the number of nodes in the first processor is \nnl - no = nl and the number of nodes in last processor is \nnp - np- l = n - 1 - np- l .  Hence, we have \nNow, we have \nd = \nn - 1 np- l - nl \nP \n. \nP- l \n2 2a + \(P - l P - l Round Robin Partitioning \n\(12 partitions, the number of nodes is almost \nequal for all partitions.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
