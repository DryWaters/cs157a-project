Emergence \nof Big Data or data centric technologies indicates the beginning \nof a new form of the continuous technology advancement that \nis characterized by overlapping technology waves related to \ndifferent aspects of the human activity from production and \nconsumption to collaboration and general social activity In this \ncontext data intensive science plays key role. \nBig Data are becoming related to almost all aspects of \nhuman activity from just recording events to research, design, \nproduction and digital services or products delivery, to the final \nconsumer. Current technologies such as Cloud Computing and \nubiquitous network connectivity provide a platform for \nautomation of all processes in data collection, storing nprocessing and visualization.  \nModern e-Science infrastructures allow targeting new large \nscale problems whose solution was not possible before, e.g. \ngenome, climate, global warming. e-Science typically produces \na huge amount of data that need to be supported by a new type \nof e-Infrastructure capable to store, distribute process, \npreserve, and curate these data [1, 2]: we refer to this new \ninfrastructures as  Scientific Data e-Infrastructure \(SDI internal relations, they are becoming \nan infrastructure of their own and need to be supported by ncorresponding physical or logical infrastructures to store, \naccess and manage these data. \nThe emerging SDI should allow different groups of \nresearchers to work on the same data sets, build their own \n\(virtual research and collaborative environments, safely store \nintermediate results, and later share the discovered results.

BIG DATA DEFINITION AND ANALYSIS \nA. Big Data 


Nature in e-Science and Industry \nScience has been traditionally dealing with challenges to \nhandle large volume of data in complex scientific research \nexperiments. Scientific research typically includes collection nof data in passive observation or active experiments which aim \nto verify one or another scientific hypothesis. Scientific \nresearch and discovery methods typically are based on the \ninitial hypothesis and a model which can be refined based on \nthe collected data. The refined model may lead to a new more \nadvanced and precise experiment and/or the previous data re-\nevaluation. Another distinctive feature of the modern scientific \nresearch is that it suggests wide cooperation between \nresearchers to challenge complex problems and run complex \nscientific instruments. In industry, private companies will not \nshare data or expertise When dealing with data, companies \nwill intend always keep control over their information assets. \nThey may use shared third party facilities, like clouds, but \nspecial measures need to be taken to ensure data protection, \nincluding data sanitization. It might be also a case that \ncompanies can use shared facilities only for proof of concept \nand do production data processing at private facilities. In this \nrespect, we need to accept that science and industry can't be \ndone in the same way, and consequently this will be reflected nin a way how they can interact and how the Big Data \ninfrastructure and tools can be built. \nWith the digital technologies proliferation into all aspects \nof business activities and emerging Big Data technologies the nindustry is entering a new playground when it needs to use \nscientific methods to benefit from the possibility to collect and \nmine data for desirable information, such as market prediction, \ncustomer behavior predictions, social groups activity \npredictions, etc.  \nA number of discussions and blog articles [4, 5, 6 suggest \nthat the Big Data technologies need to adopt scientific \ndiscovery methods that include iterative model improvement \nand collection of improved data, re-use of collected data with \nimproved model.  \nWe can quote here a blog article by Mike Gualtieri from \nForrester [7, 8, 9]:“Firms increasingly realize that [big data] \nmust use predictive and descriptive analytics to find \nnonobvious information to discover value in the data. \nAdvanced analytics uses advanced statistical, data mining and \nmachine learning algorithms to dig deeper to find patterns that \nyou can’t see using traditional BI \(Business Intelligence queries, or rules.” \nB. 5 Vs of Big Data \nDespite the “Big Data” became a new buzz-word, there is \nno consistent definition for Big Data, nor detailed analysis of \nthis new emerging technology. Most discussions are going \nnow in blogosphere in which however the most significant \nfeatures and incentives of the Big Data are identified and \nbecame commonly accepted. In this section we will attempt to \nsummarise available definitions and propose a consolidated \nview on the generic Big Data features that would help us to \ndefine requirements to supporting Big Data infrastructure and \nin particular Scientific Data Infrastructure. \nAs a starting point, we can refer to the simple definition \ngiven in [10]: “Big Data: a massive volume of both structured \nand unstructured data that is so large that it's difficult to \nprocess using traditional database and software techniques.”  \nRelated definition of the data-intensive science is given in \nthe book “The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific \nDiscovery” by the computer scientist Jim Gray [11]: “The \ntechniques and technologies for such data-intensive science \nare so different that it is worth distinguishing data-intensive nscience from computational science as a new, fourth paradigm \nfor scientific exploration.”  \nIn a number of discussion blogposts and articles Big Data \nare attributed to have such characteristics as Volume, \nVelocity and Variety called “3 Vs of Big Data”. Based on our \nanalysis and concurring with some other articles [5, 6 12] we \nintend to propose wider definition of Big Data as 5 Vs: \nVolume, Velocity, Variety and additionally Value and \nVeracity.  \nFigure 1 below illustrates the features related to 5 Vs \nwhich we analyse below. \n \n nFigure 1. 5 Vs of Big Data \n1 which impose additional and specific requirements to \nall traditional technologies and tools currently used nIn e-Science, growth of data amount is caused by \nadvancements in both scientific instruments and SDI. In many \nareas the trend is actually to include data collections from all \nobserved events, activities and sensors what became possible \nand is important for social activities and social sciences. \nBig Data volume includes such features as size, scale, \namount, dimension for tera- and exascale data recording either \ndata rich processes, or collected from many transactions and \nstored in individual files or databases – all needs to be \naccessible, searchable, processed and manageable. \nTwo examples from e-Science give also different ncharacters of data and also different processing requirements, \nsuch as: \nLarge Hadron Collider \(LHC produces in average 5 PB \ndata a month  that are generated in a number of short collisions \n49\nthat make them unique events, The collected data are filtered, \nstored and extensively searched for single events that may nconfirm a scientific hypothesis. \nLOFAR \(Low Frequency Array every hour, however the data are \nprocessed by correlator and only correlated data are stored. \nIn industry global services providers such as Google, \nFacebook, Twitter are producing, analyzing and storing data in 


nhuge amount as their regular activity/production services. \nAlthough some of their tools and processes are proprietary, \nthey actually prove the feasibility of solving Big Data \nproblems at the global scale and significantly push the \ndevelopment of the Open Source Big Data tools. \n2 generated at high speed, including also \ndata generated by arrays of sensors or multiple events, and \nneed to be processed in real-time, near real-time or in batch, or \nas streams \(like in case of visualisation example, LHC ATLAS detector [http://atlas.ch/] \nuses about 80 readout channels and collects up to 1PB of nunfiltered data in second which are reduced to approx. 100MB \nper second. This should record up to 40 million collision \nevents per second.  \nIndustry can also provide numerous examples when data \nregistration processing or visualization impose similar \nchallenges. \n3 data and \ninformation and semantic models behind these data. This is \nresulted in data collected as structured, unstructured, semi-\nstructured, and a mixed data. Data variety imposes new \nrequirements to data storage and database design which should \ndynamic adaptation to the data format, in particular scaling up \nand down. \nData variety will in particular increase when biological, \nhuman and societal systems will become a subject of closer \nresearch and monitoring. An example of the latter is urban \nenvironment that requires operating, monitoring and evolving \nof numerous processes, individuals and associations. \nAdopting data technologies in traditionally non-computer \noriented areas such as psychology and behavior research, \nhistory archeology will generate especially rich data sets. \n4 which is defined \nby the added-value that the collected data can bring to the \nintended process, activity or predictive analysis/hypothesis. \nData value will depend on the events or processes they \nrepresent such as stochastic, probabilistic, regular or random. \nDepending on this the requirements may be imposed to collect nall data, store for longer period \(for some possible event of \ninterest closely related to the \ndata volume and variety. \n5 aspects: data \nconsistency \(or certainty trustworthiness that is defined \nby a number of factors including data origin, collection and \nprocessing methods, including trusted infrastructure and \nfacility. \nBig Data veracity ensures that the data used are trusted, \nauthentic and protected from unauthorised access and \nmodification. The data must be secured during the whole their \nlifecycle from collection from trusted sources to processing on \ntrusted compute facilities and storage on protected and trusted \nstorage facilities.  \nThe following aspects define and need to be addressed to \nensure data veracity: \n? Integrity of data and linked data \(e.g., for complex \nhierarchical data, distributed data trusted n? Computer and storage platform trustworthiness \n? Availability and timeliness \n? Accountability and Reputation \nData veracity relies entirely on the security infrastructure \ndeployed and available from the Big Data infrastructure. \nIII. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS TO BIG DATA E-SCIENCE \nINFRASTRUCTURE \nA. Paradigm change in Big Data e-Science  \nBig Data Science is becoming a new technology driver and \nrequires re-thinking a number of infrastructure components, \nsolutions and processes to address the following general \nchallenges [2, 3]: \n Exponential growth of data volume produced by different \nresearch instruments and/or collected from sensors n? Need to consolidate e-Infrastructures as persistent research \nplatforms to ensure research continuity and cross-\ndisciplinary collaboration, deliver/offer persistent services, \nwith adequate governance model.  \nThe recent advancements in the general ICT and big data \ntechnologies facilitate the paradigm change in modern e-\nScience that is characterized by the following features: \n? Automation of all e-Science processes including data \ncollection, storing, classification, indexing and other \ncomponents of the general data curation and provenance. \n? Transformation of all processes, events and products into \ndigital form by means of multi-dimensional multi-faceted \nmeasurements, monitoring and control; digitising existing \nartifacts and other content. \n? Possibility to re-use the initial and published research data \nwith possible data re-purposing for secondary research \n? Global data availability and access over the network for \ncooperative group of researchers, including wide public \naccess to scientific data. \n? Existence of necessary infrastructure components and \nmanagement tools that allow fast infrastructures and \nservices composition adaptation and provisioning on \ndemand for specific research projects and tasks. \n? Advanced security and access control technologies that \nensure secure operation of the complex research \ninfrastructures and scientific instruments and allow \ncreating trusted secure environment for cooperating groups \nand individual researchers  \n50\nThe future SDI should support the whole data lifecycle and \nexplore the benefit of the data storage/preservation, aggregation \nand provenance in a large scale and during long/unlimited \nperiod of time Important is that this infrastructure must ensure \ndata security \(integrity, confidentiality, availability and \naccountability 


powerful computation, \nthere should be a possibility to enforce data/dataset policy that \nthey can be processed on trusted systems and/or complying \nother requirements. Researchers must trust the SDI to process ntheir data on SDI facilities and be ensured that their stored \nresearch data are protected from non-authorised access. Privacy \nissues are also arising from distributed remote character of SDI \nthat can span multiple countries with different local policies. \nThis should be provided by the Access Control and Accounting \nInfrastructure \(ACAI  and specific SDI requirements \nA short overview of some research infrastructures and \ncommunities, in particular the ones defined for the Europe \nResearch Area \(ERA  for future SDIs to address Big Data challenges.  \nExisting studies of European e-Infrastructures analyze the nscientific communities practices and requirements; examples \nare those undertaken by the SIENA Project [15 EIROforum \nFederated Identity Management Workshop [14], European Grid \nInfrastructure \(EGI 16], UK Future Internet \nStrategy Group Report [17].  \nThe High Energy Physics community represents a large nnumber or researchers, unique expensive instruments, huge \namount of data that are generated and need to be processed \ncontinuously. This community has already the operational \nWorldwide Large Hadron Collider Grid WLCG  scientific data lifecycle. WLCG \ndevelopment was an important step in the evolution of \nEuropean e-Infrastructures that currently serves multiple \nscientific communities in Europe and internationally. The EGI \ncooperation [16] manages European and worldwide \ninfrastructure for HEP and other communities. \nMaterial science, analytical and low energy physics \(proton, \nneutron, laser facilities projects, \nexperiments and consequently highly dynamic user \ncommunity. It requires highly dynamic supporting ninfrastructure and advanced data management infrastructure to \nallow wide data access and distributed processing. \nEnvironmental and Earth science community and projects \ntarget regional/national and global problems. They collect huge \namount of data from land, sea, air and space and require ever \nincreasing amount of storage and computing power. This SDI \nrequires reliable fine-grained access control to huge data sets nenforcement of regional issues, policy based data filtering \(data \nmay contain national security related information also defined as Life \nsciences instruments development. They \ngenerates massive amount of data and new demand for \ncomputing power, storage capacity, and network performance \nfor distributed processes, data sharing and collaboration. \nBiomedical data healthcare, clinical case data npolicy on Personal Data processing [19].  \nSocial Science and Humanities communities and projects \nare characterized by multi-lateral and often global \ncollaborations between researchers from all over the world that \nneed to be engaged into collaborative groups/communities and \nsupported by collaborative infrastructure to share data, \ndiscovery/research results and cooperatively evaluate results. \nThe current trend to digitize all currently collected physical \nartifacts will create in the near future a huge amount of data \nthat must be widely and openly accessible. \nC. General SDI Requirements \nFrom the overview we just gave we can extract the nfollowing general infrastructure requirements to SDI for \nemerging Big Data Science: \n? Support long running experiments and large data volumes \ngenerated at high speed \n? Data integrity, confidentiality, accountability n? Support for long running experiments and large data \nvolumes generated at high speed \n? Multi-tier inter-linked data distribution and replication \n? On-demand infrastructure provisioning to support data sets nand scientific workflows, mobility of data-centric \nscientific applications \n? Support of virtual scientists communities, addressing \ndynamic user groups creation and management, federated \nidentity management \n Trusted environment for data storage and processing \n? Support for data integrity, confidentiality accountability \n? Policy binding to data to protect privacy, confidentiality \nand IPR \nIV. DATA MANAGEMENT IN BIG DATA SCIENCE \nEmergence of computer aided research methods is \ntransforming the way research is done and scientific data are \nused. The following types of scientific data are defined [13]: \n? Raw data collected from observation and from experiment \n\(according to an initial research model that went through data \nfiltering and processing \(supporting some particular formal \nmodel that supports one or another scientific \nhypothesis, research result or statement \n? Data linked to publications to support the wide research \nconsolidation, integration, and openness. \nOnce the data is published, it is essential to allow other \nscientists to be able to validate and reproduce the data that they nare interested in, and possibly contribute with new results. \nCapturing information about the processes involved in \ntransformation from raw data up until the generation of \npublished data becomes an important aspect of scientific data \nmanagement. Scientific data provenance becomes an issue that \nalso needs to be 


taken into consideration by SDI providers [20].   \nAnother aspect to take into consideration is to guarantee nreusability of published data within the scientific community. \nUnderstanding semantic of the published data becomes an \nimportant issue to allow for reusability, and this had been \ntraditionally been done manually However, as we anticipate \nunprecedented scale of published data that will be generated in \n51\nBig Data Science, attaching clear data semantic becomes a \nnecessary condition for efficient reuse of published data nLearning from best practices in semantic web community on \nhow to provide a reusable published data, will be one of \nconsideration that will be addressed by SDI. \nBig data are typically distributed both on the collection side \nand on the processing/access side: data need to be collected \n\(sometimes in a time sensitive way or with other environmental \nattributes of the problems to be addressed by SDI. \nThe European Commission’s initiative to support Open \nAccess to scientific data from publicly funded projects suggests \nintroduction of the following mechanisms to allow linking \npublications and data [21, 22]:  \n? PID - persistent data ID  \n? ORCID – Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier \n[23]. \nThe required new approach to data management and \nhandling in e-Science is reflected in the Scientific Data \nLifecycle Management \(SDLM see Figure 2 of the existing practices in different scientific \ncommunities. Our proposed model is compliant with the data nlifecycle study results presented in [24].  \nThe generic scientific data lifecycle includes a number of nconsequent stages: research project or experiment planning; \ndata collection; data processing; publishing research results; \ndiscussion, feedback; archiving \(or discarding Management in e-Science \n \nNew SDLM requires data storage and preservation at all \nstages what should allow data re-use/re-purposing and \nsecondary research on the processed data and published results. \nHowever, this is possible only if the full data identification, \ncross-reference and linkage are implemented in SDI. Data nintegrity, access control and accountability must be supported \nduring the whole data during lifecycle. Data curation is an \nimportant component of the discussed SDLM and must also be \ndone in a secure and trustworthy way. \nSupport data security and access control to scientific data \nduring their lifecycle: data acquisition experimental data mining, data and research information \narchiving. \nV. PROPOSED SDI ARCHITECTURE MODEL \nWe also propose the SDI Architecture for e-Science \(e-\nSDI nLayer D1: Network infrastructure layer represented by the \ngeneral purpose Internet infrastructure and dedicated network \ninfrastructure \nLayer D2: Datacenters and computing resources/facilities \nLayer D3 Infrastructure virtualisation layer that is \nrepresented by the Cloud/Grid infrastructure services and nmiddleware supporting specialised scientific platforms \ndeployment and operation \nLayer D4: \(Shared Scientific platforms and instruments \nspecific for different research areas \nLayer D5: Federation and Policy layer that includes \nfederation infrastructure components, including policy and \ncollaborative user groups support functionality. \nLayer D6: Scientific applications and user portals/clients \nNote: “D” prefix denotes relation to data infrastructure. \n \n \nFigure 3. The proposed SDI architecture model \n \nWe define also the three cross-layer planes: Operational \nSupport and Management System; Security plane; and \nMetadata and Lifecycle Management. • \nThe dynamic character of SDI and its support of distributed \nmulti-faceted communities are guaranteed by the dedicated \nlayers: D3 – Infrastructure Virtualisation layer that typically nuses modern cloud technologies; and D5 – Federation and \npolicy layer that incorporates related federated infrastructure \nmanagement and access technologies [13, 25, 26]. Introducing \nthe Federation and Policy layer reflects current practice in \nbuilding and managing complex SDIs \(and also enterprise \ninfrastructures allows independently managed \ninfrastructures to share resources and support the inter-\norganisational cooperation. \nNetwork infrastructure is presented as a separate lower \nlayer in e-SDI. Network aspects in Big Data are becoming even \nmore important than it was e.g. with Computer Grids and \nclouds. Although the dilemma of moving data to computing \nfacilities or vice versa moving computing to data location can \nbe solved in some particular cases, processing highly \ndistributed data on MPP \(Massively Parallel Processing will require a special design of the internal MPP \nnetwork infrastructure. The authors refer to their long time \nresearch on high speed optical networking and experience of \nbuilding optical network infrastructure for e-Science [27, 28].  \n52\nVI. CLOUD BASED INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES FOR SDI \nFigure 4 illustrates the typical e-Science or enterprise \ncollaborative infrastructure that is created on demand and \nincludes enterprise proprietary and cloud based computing and \nstorage resources, instruments, control and monitoring system nvisualization system, and users represented by user clients and \ntypically residing in real or virtual campuses.  \nThe main goal of the enterprise or scientific infrastructure is \nto support the enterprise or scientific workflow and operational \nprocedures related to processes monitoring and data processing. \nCloud 


technologies simplify the building of such infrastructure \nand provision it on-demand. Figure 3 illustrates how an \nexample enterprise or scientific workflow can be mapped to \ncloud based services and later on deployed and operated as an \ninstant inter-cloud infrastructure. It contains cloud \ninfrastructure segments IaaS VR3-VR5 VR6, \nVR7 VR1, VR2 campuses A and B, and interconnecting them \nnetwork infrastructure that in many cases may need to use ndedicated network links for guaranteed performance. \n \n \n \nFigure 4. From scientific workflow to cloud based infrastructure. \nEfficient operation of such infrastructure will require both \noverall infrastructure management and individual services and \ninfrastructure segments to interact between themselves. This \ntask is typically out of scope of the existing cloud service \nprovider models but will be required to support perceived \nbenefits of the future e-SDI. These topics are a subject of \nanother research we did on the InterCloud Architecture \nFramework [29, 30]. \nBesides the general cloud base infrastructure services n\(storage, compute, infrastructure/VM management required to \nsupport Big Data and other data centric applications [31]: \n? Cluster services \n? Hadoop related services and tools \n? Specialist data analytics tools \(logs, events, data mining, \netc SQL, NoSQL \n? MPP \(Massively Parallel Processing indexing/search, semantics, namespaces \n? Security infrastructure \(access control, policy enforcement nconfidentiality, trust, availability, privacy groups management analytics tools are currently offered by the major \ncloud services providers such as: Amazon Elastic MapReduce nand Dynamo [32], Microsoft Azure HDInsight [33], IBM Big \nData Analytics [34]. Scalable Hadoop and data analytics tools \nservices are offered by few companies that position themselves \nas Big Data companies such as Cloudera, [35] and few others \n[36]. \nVII. SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BIG DATA \nA. Security and Trust in Cloud based Infrastructure \nEnsuring data veracity in Big Data infrastructure and \napplications requires deeper analysis of all factors affecting \ndata security and trustworthiness during their whole lifecycle nFigure 5 illustrates the main actors and their relations when \nprocessing data on remote system User/customer and service \nprovider are the two actors concerned with their own \ndata/content security and each other system/platform \ntrustworthiness: user wants to be sure that their data are secure \nwhen processed or stored on the remote system.  \n \n \nFigure 5. Security and Trust in Data Services and Infrastructure nFigure 5 illustrates the complexity of trust and security \nrelations even in a simple usecase of the direct user/provider \ninteraction. In clouds data security and trust model needs to be \nextended to distributed multi-domain and multi-provider \nenvironment.  \nIn the general case of multi-provider and multi-tenant e-\nScience cooperative environment, the e-SDI security \ninfrastructure should support on-demand created and ndynamically configured user groups and associations, \npotentially re-using existing experience in managing Virtual \nOrganisations \(VO  models when used in generically \ndistributed and also multi-provider e-SDI environment will \nrequire policy binding to data and fine grained data access \npolicy that should allow flexible policy definition based on the nsemantic data model. Based on the authors’ experience, the \nXACML \(eXtensible Access Control Mark-up Language  data lifecycle and related \nprovenance information will require additional research in \npolicy definition and underlying trust management models. \n53\nB. General Requirements to Access Control Infrastructure \nTo support secure data processing, the future SDI should \nbe supported by a corresponding Access Control and \nAccounting Infrastructure \(ACAI and \nallow user identification/authentication and policy \nenforcement in distributed multi-organisations environment.  \nMoving to Open Access [21] may require partial change of \nbusiness practices of currently existing scientific information \nrepositories and libraries, and consequently the future ACAI \nshould allow such transition and fine grained access control \nand flexible policy definition and control. \nTaking into account that future SDI should support the \nwhole data lifecycle and explore the benefit of the data nstorage/preservation, aggregation and provenance in a large \nscale and during long/unlimited period of time the future \nACAI should also support all stages of the data lifecycle, \nincluding policy attachment to data to ensure persistency of \nthe data policy enforcement during continuous online and \noffline processes. \nThe required ACAI should support the following features \nof the future SDI: \n? Empower researchers \(and make them trust information security  \n? Motivate/ensure researchers to share/open their research \nenvironment to other researchers by providing tools for \ninstantiation of customised pre-configured infrastructures \nto allow other researchers to work with existing or own \ndata sets. \n? Protect data policy, ownership, linkage \(with other 


data \nsets and newly produced scientific/research data long term Data preservation \ntechnologies should themselves ensure data readability \nand accessibility with the changing technologies further \nBig Data definition initially presented in this paper. At this \nstage we tried to summarise and re-think some widely used \ndefinitions related to Big Data, further research will require \nmore formal approach and taxonomy of the general Big Data \nuse cases both in science and industry. \nAlthough currently proposed SDLM definition have been \naccepted as the European Commission Study recommendation \n[13], we plan to move further definition of the related metadata, \nprocedures and protocols to the Research Data Alliance \(RDA n[41] community recently established to coordinate \nstandardisation in the area of research data.  \nAs a part of the general infrastructure research we will \ncontinue research on the infrastructure issues in Big Data ntargeting more detailed and technology oriented definition of \nSDI and related security infrastructure definition. Special \nattention will be given to defining the whole cycle of the \nprovisioning SDI services on-demand, specifically tailored to \nsupport instant scientific workflows using cloud IaaS and PaaS nplatforms. This research will be also supported by development \nof the corresponding Cloud and InterCloud architecture \nframework to support the Big Data e-Science processes and \ninfrastructure operation nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work was motivated and partly supported by the \nEuropean Commission “Study on Authentication, \nAuthorization and Accounting \(AAA Europe” resulted in the report \ncurrently published as [13]. The authors value wide discussions \nbetween the consortium members on the different aspects of \nthe existing research infrastructures and AAA technologies nwhich findings found further development in this paper.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
