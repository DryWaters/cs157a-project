We considered two different scenarios\nwith three TCP ?ows TCP1xTCP2xTCP3 UDPxTCP1xTCP2 the simulations, we used SUMO\nto generate the vehicle movement and NS3 to analyze the\nnetwork performance. We considered IEEE 802.11p standard\nand TwoRayGroundPropagationLossModel. We evaluate the\nnetwork performance considering throughput and cwnd met-\nrics. The simulation results show that TCP ?ows during the\nbeginning phases of transmission performs good because of the\nslow-start mechanism. For TCP1xTCP2xTCP3 scenario and\nsmall data rates, there are some oshillations, but all TCP ?ows\nsend data to destination almost all the simulation time. For\nUDPxTCP1xTCP2 scenario and small data rates, TCP ?ows\nafter detecting congestion they send only few packets and UDP\nhave priority. For UDPxTCP1xTCP2 scenario and big data\nrates, TCP and UDP have competing data ?ows going over\nthe same intermediate nodes and UDP is more aggressive than\nTCP.\nKeywords-VANETs, Routing Protocol, AODV, TCP, UDP,\nFairness.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years wireless networks are continuing to at-\ntract attention for their potential use in several ?elds such\nas ad-hoc networks, sensor networks, mesh networks, and\nvehicular networks.\nVehicular Ad-hoc Networks \(VANETs are a special type\nof Ad-hoc networks. VANETs are an important component\nof the Intelligent Transportation Systems \(ITS forms of inter-vehicle communi-\ncations.\nDue to the high cost of deploying and implementing\nVANET systems in a real environment, most of research\nis concentrated on simulations.\nIn the recent years, a lot of simulators for VANETs\nhave been emerging [1]. For example, the IMPORTANT\nframework has been one of the ?rst attempt to understand\nthe dependence between vehicular traf?c and communication\nperformance [2], [3]. The authors analyzed the impact of the\nnode mobility on the duration of communication paths.\nIn [4], the authors present a simulator written in Java,\nwhich can generate mobility traces in several formats. There\nare also other powerful traf?c simulators, like TranSim [5],\nwhich makes use of a cellular automaton for simulating the\ninteraction of vehicles. Cellular Automaton based VEhicular\nNETwork \(CAVENET  simulator which\ncan be used to understand the properties of the mobility\nmodels of vehicular traf?c and their impact on the perfor-\n2013 Eighth International Conference on Broadband, Wireless Computing, Communication and Applications\n978-0-7695-5093-0/13 $31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BWCCA.2013.141\n302\nmance of VANETs.\nAlso SUMO is another powerful traf?c simulator, in-\ntended for traf?c planning and road design optimization.\nThere is an attempt to interface SUMO with NS2 [6].\nSince VANETs are a speci?c class of ad-hoc networks,\nthe commonly used ad-hoc routing protocols initially im-\nplemented for MANETs have been tested and evaluated\nfor VANET environments. VANETs share some common\ncharacteristics with MANETs. They are both characterized\nby the movement and self organization of the nodes. We con-\nsider the possibility of using ad-hoc and MANET protocols\nfor VANET scenarios.\nIn our previous work [11], we evaluated the perfor-\nmance of three routing protocols: Ad-hoc On-demand Dis-\ntance Vector \(AODV  OLSR  Dynamic MANET On Demand\n\(DYMO   model.\nIn this work, we use Simulation of Urban Mobility\n\(SUMO NS3\nto evaluate the performance of AODV routing protocols in\na Manhattan grid VANET scenario when sending triple TCP\n?ow and one UDP and two TCP ?ows.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section\nII, we describe TCP congestion control and TCP NewReno\ncongestion avoidance algorithm. In Section III, we brie?y\ndescribe AODV routing protocol. The simulation system\ndesign and description is presented in Section IV. In Section\nV, we show the simulation results. Finally, the conclusions\nand future work are presented in Section VI.\nII. TCP CONGESTION CONTROL\nTCP is the basic transport layer protocol used to provide\na reliable end-to-end data transmission. It uses several algo-\nrithms for congestion control. The goal of TCP congestion\ncontrol avoidance algorithms is to increase the congestion\nwindow size if there is additional bandwidth available on\nthe network, and decrease the congestion window size when\nthere is congestion.\nIn this work, we use TCP NewReno. TCP NewReno is\na modi?cation of TCP Reno. Its implementation overcomes\nthe drawback 


of TCP Reno by modifying the Fast Recovery\nalgorithm to eliminate TCP Reno‘s wait for a retransmit\ntimer when multiple packets are lost from one window of\ndata [9]. TCP NewReno implements some modi?cations in\nFast Recovery algorithm, in order to improve the response\nto partial acknowledgments, which were ?rst proposed by\nJaney Hoe [10].\nIn TCP NewReno, when a sender receives a partial\nacknowledgement, it does not come out of Fast Recovery\nphase but it retransmits the lost packet and continues to\nbe in this phase. Thus, in a multiple packet loss scenario\nNewReno does not reduce cwnd multiple times by entering\nand exiting Fast Recovery phase multiple times. It stays in\nFast Recovery phase until all the packets of the same window\nare acknowledged. In this way TCP NewReno avoids many\nof the retransmit timeouts when multiple packets are lost\nfrom one window of data. However, it can retransmit one\nlost packet per RTT when the connection is in Fast Recovery\nphase NewReno enters into fast-retransmit when it receives\nmultiple duplicate packets.\nIII. AODV ROUTING PROTOCOL\nThe AODV is an improvement of DSDV [19] to on-\ndemand scheme. It minimize the broadcast packet by creat-\ning route only when needed. Every node in network main-\ntains the route information table and participate in routing\ntable exchange. When source node wants to send data to the\ndestination node, it ?rst initiates route discovery process. In\nthis process, source node broadcasts Route Request \(RREQ neighbours. Neighbour nodes which receive\nRREQ forward the packets to its neighbour nodes. This\nprocess continues until RREQ reach to the destination or\nthe node who know the path to destination.\nWhen the intermediate nodes receive RREQ, they record\nin their tables the address of neighbours, thereby establishing\na reverse path. When the node which knows the path to\ndestination or destination node itself receives RREQ, it sends\nback Route Reply \(RREP When the source\nnode receives RREP packet, it can know the path to desti-\nnation node and it stores the discovered path information in\nits route table. This is the end of route discovery process.\nThen, AODV performs route maintenance process. In route\nmaintenance process, each node periodically transmits a\nHello message to detect link breakage.\nIV. SIMULATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION\nWe use SUMO [21] to generate the mobility patterns of\nvehicles and NS3 to simulate VANET environment. The\ndetailed simulation model is based on NS-3 \(ver-3.14.1  language, because it better\nfacilitated the inclusion of C-based implementation code.\nThe NS3 architecture is similar to Linux computers, with\ninternal interface and application interfaces such as network\ninterfaces device drivers and sockets. The goals of NS3 are\nset very high: to create a new network simulator aligned\nwith modern research needs and develop it in an open source\ncommunity. Users of NS3 are free to write their simulation\nscripts as either C++ main towards the power-user\nbut more accessible “helper” APIs are overlaid on top of the\nlow-level API.\nIn order to achieve scalability of a very large number of\nsimulated network elements, the NS3 simulation tools also\nsupport distributed simulation. The NS3 support standard-\nized output formats for trace data, such as the pcap format\n303\nTable II\nSIMULATION PARAMETERS.\nParameter Value\nNetwork Simulator NS3\nRouting Protocol AODV\nSimulation Time 300 s\nSimulation Area 600 m x 600 m\nSimulation Scenario Manhattan grid\nNumber of Nodes 50\nNumber of Flows 3\nSource Node ID 3, 4, 24\nDestination Node ID 7\nSpeed 40 \(km/h NewReno and UDP\nApplication Type FTP and CBR\nPacket Size 512 bytes\nData rate 0.1 Mbps, 1 Mbps\nMAC Protocol IEEE802.11 p\nTransmission Range 250 m\nRadio Propagation Models Two-ray Ground\nTCP1 Sending Time 160 s - 226 s\nUDP Sending Time 160 s - 226 s\nTCP2 Sending Time 164 s - 240 s\nTCP3 Sending Time 140 s - 204 s\nNetwork Simulation Time 140 s - 240 s\nused by network packet analyzing, tools such as tcpdump,\nand a standardized input format such as importing mobility\ntrace ?les from NS2 [20].\nThe NS3 simulator has models for all network elements\nthat comprise a computer network. For example, network\ndevices represent the physical device that connects a node to\nthe communication channel. This might be a simple Ethernet\nnetwork interface card, or a more complex wireless IEEE\n802.11 device.\nIn our simulations, we used IEEE 802.11p standard and\nTwoRayGroundPropagationLossModel.\nIEEE 802.11p: It is an approved amendment to the IEEE\n802.11 standard to add wireless access in vehicular environ-\nments \(WAVE ITS applications. The 802.11p standard is based\non the 802.11 architecture, but version ”p” is aimed at\ncommunications between vehicles and between them and\n?xed infrastructure. This new technology uses the 5.9 GHz\nband in various propagation environments: vehicle, open,\nurban, and so on.\nThis standard de?nes the WAVE as the signalling tech-\nnique and interface functions that are controlled by the phys-\nical layer \(MAC devices where the physical layer properties\nchange rapidly and where the exchanges of information have\na short duration. The purpose of this standard is to provide\na set of speci?cations to ensure interoperability between\nwireless devices trying to communicate in rapidly changing\nenvironments and in particular time periods.\nTwoRayGroundPropagationLossModel: It considers the\ndirect path and a ground re?ection path.

For simulations,\nwe used AODV routing protocol and consider data rates of\n0.1 Mbps and 1 Mbps. The simulation time is 100 sec.\nV. SIMULATION RESULTS\nWe evaluate the performance of AODV routing protocol\nfor two different scenario: triple ?ow TCP1xTCP2xTCP3\nand UDPxTCP1xTCP2. For every scenario, we used data\nrates 0.1 Mbps and 1 Mbps and evaluate the performance\nconsidering throughput and cwnd metrics. In our simula-\ntions, three connections are established with few seconds\ndifference from each other.\nThe simulation results of AODV protocol for data rate\n0.1 Mbps for TCP1xTCP2xTCP3 and UDPxTCP1xTCP2\nare shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. In case of TCP1xTCP2xTCP3\nscenario we can see that there are some oshillations, but all\nthe ?ows transmit almost during all the simulation time.\nAll TCP ows uses congestion control mechanism and\nsend data to destination node. In case of UDPxTCP1xTCP2\nscenario after 200 s TCP ?ows detect congestion and only\nfew packets are sent. During this time, UDP ?ow is more\naggressive and uses most of the bandwidth.\nIn Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 are shown the simulation results for\nboth scenarios for data rate 1 Mbps.

disconnections, cwnd size decreases to half of\nits previous size. We can see that segment size is increased\nwith the increasing of data rate.

CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we evaluated the performance of AODV\nrouting protocols in a Manhattan grid scenario when sending\ntriple TCP1xTCP2xTCP3 and UDPxTCP1xTCP2 ?ows. We\nconsidered data rates of 0.1 Mbps and 1 Mbps and evaluated\nthe performance using throughput and cwnd metrics. We\nused SUMO to generate the movement of the vehicles and\nNS3 to test the performance of routing protocol. From the\nsimulation results, we found the following.\n• For small data rates and TCP1xTCP2xTCP3 scenario\nwe can see that there are some oshillations, but all the\n?ows transmit almost during all the simulation time.\nIn case of UDPxTCP1xTCP2 scenario after 200 s TCP\n?ows detect congestion and only few packets are sent.\nDuring this time, UDP ?ow is more aggressive and uses\nmost of the bandwidth.\n• For data rate 1Mbps, because node movement is the\nsame, we can notice similarities on the ?ow perfor-\nmance, but when UDP ?ow is used the throughput is\nhigher compared with TCP.\nIn the future, we plan to make extensive simulations for\ndifferent scenarios and different parameters.\n306\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis work was supported by Japanese Society for the\nPromotion of Science \(JSPS the ?nancial support.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

is determined by the \npartition parameter ? and the number of reduce task slots rs. \nHowever, rs is a constant value related to the initial \nconfiguration of the cluster. In this subsection, we conduct a set \nof experiments to demonstrate the impact of the partition \nadjustment parameter on the performance of load balancer. We \nrun the Ranked-Inverted-Index, CloudBurst and Sort \napplication separately. The value of ? is varied from 1 to 20. \nThe experiment results are shown in Fig. 7. \n1486\nAs shown in Fig.7 \(a Ranked-Inverted-Index, load \nbalanced jobs run 1.03-1.1x faster than unbalanced jobs. For \nCloudBurst, the jobs execution time improvement of load \nbalancer over the native Hadoop is 7% in the worst case \(? =1 16% in the best case \(? =16 nperformance improvement in the best situation \(? =4 1 demonstrate that, compared with native \nHadoop, the load balancer leads to a significant execution time nreduction, and the performance is stable when value of ? is \nvaried from 2 to 20. \nFig. 7 shows that the balanced job marginally outperforms \nthe unbalanced job when the partition adjustment parameter ? \nis set to be 1. In this case, the number of virtual partition used \nin load balancer is equal to the number of partition in native \nHadoop; however, by using HAP algorithm, we can allocate \nthe largest partition to most powerful computing node. Hence, \nstraggler task’s execution time can be shortened. As increasing \nof the partition adjustment parameter of HAP, work \ndistribution among reducers becomes more balanced. However, \nthe performance cannot always improve with the increase of \nthe partition adjustment parameter. This is because of noverhead, which is incurred by fetching metadata of virtual \npartitions and transferring the map outputs to the reducers, \nincreases as inputs become larger. Without loss of generality, \nthe partition adjustment parameter is set to 12 in the following \nexperiments.  \nB.  Load Balancer Performance \nAs pointed out in Sec.2.2, in order to reduce job execution \nfor straggler tasks, the speculative execution is turned on in nnative Hadoop. However this is a waste of cluster resources, as \nthe speculative task races with straggler task and takes up a \ntask slot. Hence, in some cases \(i.e. Facebook tasks is disabled [7]. Our load balancer \ndisables the speculation for reduce tasks too. In this subsection nwe compare the load balancer with native Hadoop with \nspeculative execution for reduce tasks enabled and disabled \nrespectively. For each setting, we test the performance of load \nbalancer with four applications i.e. cloudburst, sort, Ranked-\nInverted-Index and K-means For the first three applications, the number \nof virtual partitions is set to 12 as mentioned in section 5.1 For \nK-means, the number of reduce tasks is related to the number \nof clusters k. If the number of reduce slots rs is more than k, the \nnumber of idle reduce slots will be rs – k. To demonstrate the \nbenefit of load balance algorithm for this situation, in our \nexperiment the partition adjustment parameter ? is set to 1 and nthe number of clusters k is set to 15. \nFig.8 shows the normalized job execution time when \nrunning different applications. For Ranked-Inverted-Index, \nload balanced jobs exhibit 8% performance improvement \ncompared with native Hadoop and 33% compared with no \nspeculation. For k-means, the load balancer resulted in up to \n6.6 performance improvement compared with native hadoop \nand 13.8% compared with Hadoop with reduce task speculative \nexecution disabled. For cloudburst, the peroformance \nimprovements of load balancer compared with native and no \nspeculation are 13% and 13.8% respectively. For sort, load \nbalance resulted in up to 16.2% and 18.5% faster job execution \ntime than native Hadoop and native Hadoop with no \nspeculation respectively. \n nFig.8 Job execution time for load balancer against native Hadoop and no \nspeculation. \nAs clearly shown in Fig.8, when the reduce task speculative \nexecution disabled, it takes much longer time to execute the job nthan native Hadoop and no speculation. The reason is that each \nnode exhibits different computing capability in heterogeneous \nMapReduce systems. The reduce task, which is allocated to the \nslowest node, becomes the straggler that delay the completion \nof the whole job. In contrast, when the reduce task speculative nexecution enabled, the task which is slower than expected is \ndetected, and a speculative task is launched Although \nspeculative task may shorten the execution time of the whole \njob, it can be launched only after all normal tasks have been \nlaunched and some idle reduce slots are available. Whatever \nthe straggler task finishes early or the speculative task finishes \nfirst, two reduce task slots are taken to process the same work. \nHence, it can be a waste of cluster resources. Unlike the \nspeculation approach, the speculative execution for reduce \ntasks is disabled in our load balancer. However, the load \nbalancer can allocate work to reducers fairly, thus straggler \ntasks are avoided essentially and speculation is not needed. As \na result, by using load balancer, job execution time can be \nminimized, and the utilization of cluster resources is improved. \nC.  Balancing Overhead \nIn this subsection, we measure the balancing overhead and \nwith the execution time breakdown of reduce tasks. We \ncompare the load balancer based on HAP algorithm \(HAP native Hadoop \(NS 


Ranked-Inverted-Index, \nSort and K-means separately. For K-means, the number of \nreduce task is determined by the number of clusters k. In order \nto evaluate performance of the load balancer when the number \nof reduce tasks is less than the number of reducer task slots rs, \nwe modify the K-means algorithm and parameter k is to 15. \nInitially the number of reduce tasks is set to be 21 manually for \nabove three applications. The results demonstrate that, \ncompared with no speculation, the execution time of reduce \ntask is reduced and the overhead incurred by HAP algorithm is \nvery small, as shown in Fig. 9. \nFig. 9\(a breakdown of reduce \ntasks of Ranked-Inverted-Index application. When the \napplication runs in native Hadoop system with the speculative \n1487\n \n\(a b c of reduce tasks \nexecution of reduce tasks is disabled, the reduce task assigned \nto node g15 becomes the straggler task who completes in 1350 \nseconds. With HAP algorithm, the straggler task assigned to \nnode g01 completes only in 1057 seconds. In this case, load \nbalanced reduce tasks run 21.8% faster than unbalanced tasks. \nFig. 9\(b fifteen partitions \nbecause the number of clusters k is to 15 in the beginning. Each \npartition is sent to one reducer. The five tasks of all reduce \ntasks complete in short time. When the load balance feature is ndisabled, the straggler task assigned to node g05 completes in \n735 seconds. With load balancer enabled, the execution of \nstraggler task assigned to node g01 drops to 490 seconds. For \ncloudburst, load balance results in 11.8% performance \nimprovement for reduce tasks, as shown in Fig. 9\(c load balancer disabled, \nthe ratio of the straggler task execution time to the first finished \ntask execution time is 2.52, however only 1.35 with the load \nbalancer enabled, as shown in Fig. 9\(a nload balancer disabled, the ratio of the straggler task execution \ntime to the first finished task execution time is 1.41, however \nonly 1.068 with the load balancer enabled, as shown in Fig. \n9\(c demonstrates that, the execution time of \nstraggler tasks reduces dramatically because of the fairly work ndistribution by HAP algorithm, especially when the size of \nshuffling data is not large. For example, for the CloudBurst \napplication, the average size of input data of each reducer is 83 \nMB, and response time difference between fastest reduce task \nand slowest reduce task is only 6.8%, as shown in Fig. 9\(c nTherefore, it is fair to say that load balancer improves the \nperformance of MapReduce jobs and the utilization ratio of \ncluster resource. \nVI.  RELATED WORK \nData skew is an important problem because it can cause the \nunbalanced workloads in parallel processing system. There are \nmany effective solutions to this problem. The current \nMapReduce system implementation has overlooked this \nproblem. However, there are some studies has been carried out \nby many organizations and agencies. \nIbrahim et al. propose the LEEN algorithm to solve the \ninput data skew of reduce tasks. LEEN calculates statistics for \nthe global key/value pairs during Map task execution. All \nbuffered intermediate keys are partitioned by their frequencies \nand the fairness of the expected data distribution after the \nshuffle phase [17]. However, the LEEN assumes that the noutput load of Map function is equal; however, it is usually not \nequal. On the other word, this method does not split large \ninputs of reduce task into small ones that can lead to \nunbalanced work distribution among reduce tasks. Mohammad \net al. [18] propose the LARTS algorithm which combines the \ndata locality with Reduce schedule policy. When a free node \nrequests a reduce task from the master node, the LARTS \njudges whether the node holds the largest partition for the \nrequested task. If not, the LARTS could not assign the reduce \ntask to the node and wait the suitable requirement of computing \n1488\nnode. This approach can reduce the amounts of data transferred \nbetween nodes, but it can’t balance the input load of reducers. \nGufler et al. [19] propose a system called TopCluster that \naddress the unbalance work distribution issues by capturing \ndata skew in MapReduce system. They gather statistics from \nthe mappers and approximate the global data distribution nYongChul Kwon et al. [20] propose a system called SkewTune \nto mitigate skew in MapReduce application. They perform a \ndynamic load balancing algorithm to handling the \ncomputational skew during tasks running. This method requires \nmore data movement during tasks execution, which can add the \noverhead of network traffic. In our method, the amounts of data \nmovement are reduced, because the work for straggler task is \ndistributed evenly into reducers based on the computing \ncapability of each node before reduce tasks beginning. Smriti R nRamakrishnan et al. [21] proposed a static load balancing \nalgorithm to mitigate the skew data in MapReduce system. \nThis solution is based on the statistical modeling of the reducer \nwork distribution, and a progressive sampling technique is used \nto determine the sample size. YongChul Kwon et al. [22] \npropose SkewReduce that statically optimizes the data \npartitioning according to user-defined cost function. Both nmethods require user interaction or user knowledge of statistics \nor sampling. On the contrary, our heterogeneous-aware load \ndistribution mode does not require user interaction, and the \ncomputing capability evaluation is based on the MRLA tool \nthat can automatically analyze the history job and tasks logs 


nFinally, when the reduce keys follow the Zipfian \ndistribution, Lin et al. [6] analyze the impact of partition skew \nto performance of MapReduce systems. Their approach splits \nthe disproportionately large records into smaller ones to \nbalance the load. However this solution is aim to the data skew \nissue in map phase.  \nVII.  CONCLUSION \nCurrent MapReduce frameworks perform poorly on \nheterogeneous clusters. One of the key reasons is the load \nimbalance among reduce tasks. We identify the key causes of \nload imbalance among reduce tasks in heterogeneous \nMapReduce clusters as follow: \(1 systems, and \(2 nload balance approach with respect to the heterogeneity of \nclusters. We implemented the proposed load balance approach \nin the Hadoop framework. The experiment results show that \nour approach achieves an average speed-up of 11% over native \nHadoop in a cluster with 22 virtual machines. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work is supported by National High-Tech Research \nand Development Plan of China under the grant \nNo.2011AA01A204 2012AA01A306, National Key \nTechnology R&D Program under grant No.2011BAH04B03, \nNational Natural Science Foundation of China under grant \nNO.61202041 and Fundamental Research Funds for the \nCentral Universities under grant NO.08142007. \nREFERENCES \n[1] M.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
