Viewing data from this large dataset became a difficult task. Hence, data mining was introduced to retrieve and view the necessary data. Data mining is a process of  extracting the large databases, these databases are mostly scattered among various websites where security is required. These databases are divided into various categories such as horizontally distributed databases, vertically distributed databases and hybrid distributed databases. When this data size increases, there exists data leakage, less security, etc. The distributed databases are shared among various servers where insecurity occurs. To secure databases when sharing data in a database various methodologies were being used. Earlier there exists a trusted third party who performs various cryptographic primitives and the trusted third party acts as an intermediate between the sites in which the probability of data leakage increases. Hence, this paper proposes a new protocol to reduce the data leakage and to improve the security of the horizontally distributed databases. The outcome of the proposed architecture provides methods where no trusted third party is required, the sites themselves communicate each other for a secure mining as well as enhanced security. This proposed architecture covers almost all the disadvantages occurred in the previous algorithms and has been implemented in the synthetic employment office database Keywords-Association Rules; Distributed Computation Distributed Databases; Frequent Item Sets; Privacy Preserving Data Mining I  I NTRODUCTION  Data Mining is a technology which is used to extract large quantities of large data sets. Mining the association rule is an important data mining problem in finding an association between the different attributes in the given large data sets. There are various techniques used to solve the mining of association rule problems such as FP tree etc Data Mining is a process of  analyzing the databases that are designed to explore data \(usually large amounts of dataset are being used that are  also known as "big data in search of the most consistent and relevant patterns and the and/or relationships that are  systematic between the variables, and then to validate by applying the detected patterns for the findings The problem of mining the horizontally distributed databases with the algorithm based on association rules with security has been studied here for the several sites which are holding the homogeneous databases \(database share same schema holds different entities\. The goal is to find association rules based on support and confidence An association rule has two parts, an antecedent \(if and a consequent \(then\. An antecedent is an item found in the data. A consequence is an item that is found in combination with the antecedent. Association rules are thus created by analyzing the data for frequent patterns and using the criteria support and confidence to identify the most important relationships. Association rule mining is thus a process of mining the databases based on the association rules. This association rule is purely based on support and confidence.Support formula concludes how frequently the database occurs. Whereas confidence concludes how home many times the database is used i.e.\ based on if/then statement. The formulae to compute support and confidence are      1      2 Thus the association rule is a process of taking together the values of support and confidence and giving the best results of secure mining. A distributed database that consists of two or more data files  located at different sites on a different network. Because the database is distributed different users are allowed to access the databases  without any interference with one another. However, the secure mining of association rules in horizontally distributed databases must periodically synchronize the scattered databases to make sure that they all have consistent data In this problem the inputs are partial databases and the outputs are list of association rules in unified databases with support and confidence There are various protocols used for this problem. This paper proposes a protocol for secure computation of the union of private subsets. The proposed protocol improves in terms of simplicity, efficiency and privacy II  R ELATED W ORK  If there are m websites that hold private inputs say x1 x2,......, xm. They wish to securely compute the inputs y=f x1, x2,\205...., xm\ for a public function f. There exists a 


2015 International Conference on Circuit, Power and Computing Technologies [ICCPCT   trusted third party, the website would surrender to him all the inputs and he will perform a function evaluation and send to them the output. In the absence of such third party we need to devise a protocol for the solution \(output\ so that these websites run on their own in order to get the required output y. Kantarciolgu and Clifton studied that problem and devised the protocol for secure computation of the inputs that are held by different websites. This part of the protocol is the most costly, to implement we rely upon various cryptographic primitives. This is the part where data leakage occurs when websites extract protocol information Gayatri K et al \(2014\ proposed Secure Mining of Association Rules in Horizontally Distributed Databases Using FDM and K&C Algorithm. In their work they used FDM algorithm and Unifi-KC algorithm. Also the efficiency, computational cost and communication cost were compared in that paper. Privacy in data mining had attained and clearly explained in that paper. In their work they concluded that FDM algorithm is sufficient compared to Unifi-KC algorithm. Future work is to devise an efficient protocol for inequality verifications that uses the existence of semi-honest third party and another in the implementation of the techniques to the problem of distributed association rule mining in vertical setting Pattnaik Dr. Prasant Kumar et al \(2014\ proposed Privacy Preservation in Distributed Database. To provide the security to the distributed database, they proposed hash based secure sum cryptography technique without trusted party and another concept proposed in that paper was trusted party, one of the middle party control all the details of the all the party presents in the distributed database environment because when the Party to find the global result, that result may be frequent or infrequent.  They proposed that work with the following objectives 200  To compare the result, privacy preserving technique with and without trusted party for horizontally partitioned data 200  To provide high security for data parties with percentage of data leakage is zero by using the Apriori algorithm After comparing the result, it was proved that data leakage with trusted party is more as compared to without trusted party. Privacy also more in without trusted party as compared to with trusted parties Sonal Patil et al \(2014\proposed Overview of secure mining of association rules in horizontally distributed databases. This paper explains the overview of the topic secure mining of association rules in HDD \(Horizontally Distributed Databases\Distributed database is a database in which the storage devices are not all attached by a distributed DBMS. It may be stored in multiple computers located in the same physical location over a network of interconnected computers. Association rule is a method to find the relation between variables in large databases these horizontally distributed databases are stored where the association rule is applied to provide secure mining Jayanti Danasanal et al \(2012\osed Mining Association rules for horizontally distributed databases using the CK secure sum technique. Mining the horizontally portioned databases using an algorithm called CK secure sum protocol is hash based. It computes association rules of homogeneous databases. The proposed work taken the database as horizontally partitioned and distributed among sites and the total number of sites is greater than two. The sites are considered as trusted sites and all the sites contain their own private data and no other sites will be able to know other site\222s data. Considered four sites m1, m2, m3, m4 where the sites  interchange its position to another by following the algorithm The secure sum protocol  is based on changing neighbors in each round of computation based on its segments. The site s1 is selected as the protocol initiator site which starts the computation by distributing the first data segment. The site traverses towards sn in each round of the computation. The number of parties to this protocol must be two or more.When the summation of  all  the rounds is completed the sum is announced by the protocol initiator site. The advantage of this protocol is it addresses more than two sites and communication cost is less. The disadvantage is that the sites have same schema each site does not have information on different entities. This paper addresses the problem of computing association rules within a scenario of the homogeneous database. We here assume that all the sites are having the same schema, but each site does not have information on various entities The main goal is to build association rules that hold globally while limiting the information shared about each site. Many proposals have been sited to implement SMC SMC is used in various large scale databases which are in need  to preserve privacy to the private data of different sites Assaf Ben-David et al \(2008\roposed FairplayMP-A system of secure multiparty computation. FairplayMP is a system of secure computation which is one the greatest achievement of cryptography. This fairplayMP operates by receiving a high level language description and configuration file description of the participating websites The algorithm used is BMR \(Beaver Micali Rogaway protocol which runs for the purpose of constructing a number of communication rounds. The language used is SFDL \(Secure Function Definition Language\. The advantage is that secured multiparty is used which helps to compute data between websites. It\222s a slow process III  P URPOSE AND S COPE OF THE P ROPOSED W ORK  The concept of privacy is required when the data is distributed in a distributed database environment, i.e. when several sites holding homogeneous databases \(database share the same schema but hold information on different entities\ need privacy, so that unauthorized person will not be able to decrypt and view any data.The main goal is to find all association rules with support at least s and confidence at least c, for all minimum support size s and confidence level c, that hold unified databases This protocol has been proposed for secure mining of all the association rules in a horizontally distributed database environment. The protocol is based on Fast Distributed Mining \(FDM\lgorithm, which is the current leading protocol, which overcomes the disadvantages of various other algorithms such as apriori, FP tree etc.. This protocol improves simplicity and efficiency as well as privacy. In addition, it is simpler and more efficient in terms of communication and computational cost 


2015 International Conference on Circuit, Power and Computing Technologies [ICCPCT   IV  P ROPOSED S YSTEM AND P ROPOSED A RCHITECTURE  The proposed system focuses on the security as well to avoid data leakage of data. While extracting data from the distributed database systems more number of irrelevant data may be retrieved. To avoid this, earlier algorithms such as FP tree, etc. was used which lead to more amount of data leakage. In this paper, AES \(Advanced Encryption standard\lgorithm is used to ensure security and to encrypt and decrypt the data while inserting and retrieving AES takes very less time to encrypt and decrypt Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of the proposed system. Now a days N number of users access the network for recruitment by companies. The proposed work is projected as a website, which includes the recruitment process in companies located in various places such as Chennai, Madurai, Ramanathapuram,  etc.  where various users register their marks, contact details, qualifications etc. In such cases, earlier there exists a trusted third party who maintains the database of the employees who seek a job. This trusted third party may steal the data of employees and their sensitive information. So in this paper, the proposed architecture replaces the trusted third party and applied algorithm for the role of trusted third party. The algorithm \(make association rule\elects the employee who are all eligible for the role and store it under the database in server as of the area. Here the data is mined and faked item sets are added and stored under encrypted area. When the particular admin logins, he must send an offer letter through the mail, once mail sends he will view the decrypted candidates                         V  P ROPOSED A LGORITHM  A  Fast Distributed Mining Algorithm This algorithm is an unsecured distributed version of Apirori Algorithm. The main idea is that locally s frequent item sets must be s frequent in atleast one of the sites Globally, each website reveals its local s frequent items and then the website checks each of them to see globally they are s frequent The FDM algorithm proceeds as follows Step 1: Initialization Step 2: Candidate set selection Step3: Local pruning Step4: Unifying the candidate item sets Step5: Computing local supports Step6: Broadcast Mining Results 1  Initialization Websites already jointly calculated the item sets and the goal is to proceed and calculate f s k  The websites that are going to share secure information has jointly calculated the item set\(hash function\. Now in initialization stage we have to calculate f s k That is, set of all item sets \(item set of size k\ that are s frequent in the data set 2  Candidate Set Selection Each website calculates the set of all \(k-1\m sets. All the locally frequent item sets are gathered as a set and \(k-1\ calculated. All the globally frequent item sets are gathered as a set and \(k-1 is calculated. Apriori algorithm has been applied to generate candidate k itemsets 3  Local pruning and Unifying the Candidate Item Sets These two steps are implementation stage. In local pruning \(i.e c k the locally s frequent item sets are retained the candidate item sets are unified and the  Figure 1  Proposed Architecture

Each website broadcasts the local support that is computed by every website. From that everyone can compute global support of every itemsets c s k his consists of global support of all globally frequent k itemsets B  Formal Statement of the Problem 200  Let I = {i 1 i 2 205, i m be a set of literals, called Candidates.

One is the user registration database and the other is an administrators mined database, which are horizontally distributed as shown in the figure. In a user registration database the work of the user is to register and login and to register the qualification to get relevant jobs.

The proposed protocol is high in performance as it secures mined databases in its temporary storage. Thus, the server need not be hit every time when the data are required.

paying a price of a slightly worse ratio for subsets Taken together the price of having more subsets is preferred because subsets contain only items actually in the assembly while superset and overlap patterns also contain unrelated items The 002rst and second row of 002gure 8 correspond to the instance and the pattern-based approach for graded synchrony The third corresponds to the instance-based approach for binary synchrony Comparing the diagrams for unrelated patterns our graded method detects all injected patterns 050\002rst and second rows\051 while the binary method also produces unrelated pattern In 050Borgelt et al 2015\051 it is demonstrated that the instance-based approach yields slightly better results than the pattern approach However this approach does not consider the precision of synchrony Surprisingly using only the pattern-based approach with a graded notion of synchrony yields a better ratio for overlap and superset patterns 7 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we presented a method to detect frequent synchronous patterns in event sequences using a graded notion of synchrony for mining patterns in the presence of imprecise synchrony of events constituting occurrences and selective participation 050incomplete occurrences\051 Our method adapts methods presented in the literature to tackle selective participation using binary synchrony especially the instancebased approach which looks at instances of patterns to improve the detection by removing instances that are likely chance events checking the precision of synchrony of these instances We demonstrate in our experiments that using a graded notion of synchrony for support computation helps to simplify the detection of selective participation because a pattern-based approach yields better results or at least equally good results as an instance-based approach This is a considerable advantage since identifying the individual pattern instances is costly and thus it is desirable to avoid it ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work presented in this paper was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness 050MINECO Grant TIN2012-31372\051 and by the Principality of
