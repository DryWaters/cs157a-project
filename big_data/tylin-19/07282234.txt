Patel Department of Computer Science and Engineering Parul Institute of Technology Waghodia, Vadodara - 391760, India   Abstract 227 Rare association rule mining provides useful information from large database. Traditional association mining techniques generate frequent rules based on frequent itemsets with reference to user defined: minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold. It is known as supportconfidence framework. As many of generated rules are of no use further analysis is essential to find interesting Rules. Rare association rule contains Rare Items. Rare Association Rules represents unpredictable or unknown associations, so that it becomes more interesting than frequent association rule mining The main goal of rare association rule mining is to discover relationships among set of items in a database that occurs uncommonly. We have proposed a Maximum Constraint based method for generating rare association rule with tree structure Tentative results show that MCRP-Tree takes less time for rule generation compared to the existing algorithm as well as it finds more interesting rare items  Index Terms 227 Rare Pattern Mining, Frequent Pattern, FPGrowth, Maximum Item Support Constraint I  I NTRODUCTION  Data mining provides various methods for discovering correlations, patterns, trends or relationships from a large amount of data stored in repositories, corporate databases and data warehouses. It shows procedures for finding knowledge patterns which are hidden in large databases. Association rule mining, clustering, classification etc. are various techniques used for extracting useful knowledge from repositories. Most of Researchers have focused on extracting useful frequent patterns using association rule mining. Reliable rules are very useful and needed in many number of areas Association rule mining is an essential data mining technique to find interesting associations between the entities or items\ a database. It was proposed by Agrawal et.al. in 1993. Association rules are an important category of consistency and predictability that exist in a dataset Association rules provide a well-situated and efficient approach to recognize and characterize certain dependencies between various attributes in a database. In literature, it has been noted that there exists useful knowledge related to rare entities [4, 20   Since the overview of association rule in [1 m i n i n g th e  association rules has been broadly studied in literature [2, 3    Basic terminology of association rule mining is as follows. An association rule is best expressed by means of the expression  such that  It shows that occurrence of item X is higher than concurrence of item Y. X is known as the antecedent and Y, as the consequent The strength of association rule can only be calculated by means of its support and confidence [4 U s i ng suppo r t  a n d confidence, a set of association rules can be extracted from the database. A rule is said to be strong if its support and confidence are greater than or equal to user defined minimum support and minimum confidence. Both frequent and rare association rules present different information about the database. Frequent rules focus on patterns that occur frequently, while rare rules focus on patterns that occur infrequently. In many applications, frequently occurred events are less interesting than rarely occurred events. However frequent patterns signify the known and the expected associations while rare patterns suggest unexpected or previously unknown associations, which is more valuable to domain experts  Example 1: The dataset shown in Table I \(A\ssume a set of items   The dataset contains 10 transactions, so n=10. The set of items  is a pattern. It occurs in four transactions. Its support S can be given as     An association rule from this pattern, say  will have confidence      If minsup = 0.4 and minconf  0  75, the pattern   is a frequent pattern and the rule   is a strong rule  An itemset is said to be rare itemset if its support is   above or equal to the minimum rare support threshold but less than the minimum frequent support threshold. Three possible types of rare itemsets are available: first, which are composed of rare items only, second contains both, rare and frequent items and third that has only frequent items which fall below the minimum support threshold. First two types of itemsets are known as rare-item itemsets. Rare-item itemsets are generally more interesting than itemsets of the third type, which we call non-rare-item itemsets. Experimental results are also available for that claims the importance and usefulness of rare-item itemsets

It can be obtained by setting a low support threshold but it leads to combinatorial explosion problem. Yet it is challenging to generate rare association rules using single support threshold based methods like Frequent Pattern Growth \(FP-Growth\d Apriori. The problem of specifying an appropriate support threshold causes rare item problem. Using single minsup constraint to generate frequent patterns which have frequent and rare items raises the dilemma, called rare item problem. This problem is as follows   1  We cannot find rare item, if minsup is very high 2  For mining frequent and rare items, value of minsup should be low. But it generates large amount of frequent patterns which are not useful Example 2: Let\222s consider transactional dataset shown in Table I \(A\. With a high minsup=4, frequent patterns which consist of rare items are not found, i.e  For generating frequent patterns which consist of rare items, we take low minsup=2. It generates too many uninteresting patterns along with frequent patterns, i.e      To emphasize the \223rare item problem\224, efforts have been made in the literature to discover frequent patterns using 223multiple minimum support framework\224. As per various user and application requirement, different models have been suggested in this framework. In Maximum constraint model  ery  i t e m i s s p eci f i e d  w i t h  m i n i m u m i t e m  su pport  MIS\fter that, a minimum support of pattern is denoted with the maximal MIS value among all its items. In this way each pattern satisfies a different minimum support depending upon the items within it  Example 3: Continue with Example 2, let MIS values for the items I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6 and I7 be 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2 and 2 respectively. The frequent patterns discovered by using maximum constraint model are shown in the fourth column of Table I \(B\ It is observed that the uninteresting frequent patterns which were generated with minsup = 2 in Example 2 had been pruned in this model as they failed to satisfy their respective minsup  For finding rare association rules, maximum constraint model is more efficient. Mining frequent patterns using Apriori-like approach elevates performance problems Multiple scans were performed on a transactional dataset and a huge number of candidate pattern were generated The key contribution of this paper is an efficient algorithm called Maximum Constraint based Rare Pattern Tree \(MCRPTree\at finds rare itemsets using tree structure with maximum constraint model. Unlike previous level-wise approach, MCRP-Tree does not generate and test all combinations of rare itemset. The proposed MCRP-Tree utilizes the prior knowledge i.e. item\222s MIS value provided by the user at the time of input and discover only rare items from the transactional dataset. Tentative results show that proposed approach is more efficient. Proposed algorithm is an extension of RP-Tree that reduces number of association rules generated by pruning frequent patterns along with uninteresting items To our knowledge MCRP-Tree is a unique algorithm that uses maximum constraint model with tree structure The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we summarize the efforts made in the area of rare association rule mining. Section 3 describes basic concepts of rare association rule and presents the proposed approach, MCRPtree for mining rare association rules. Tentative results are described with UCI datasets in Section 4. Finally Section 5 concludes the paper II  R ELATED W ORK  Existing rare itemset mining algorithms are based on levelwise approach, similar to the Apriori algorithm [5  A p r i o r i  Algorithm employs iterative level-wise search for frequent itemset generation which uses a single minsup value at all levels to finding frequent itemsets. This algorithm is more useful for finding the frequent itemsets and not the rare itemsets except the case where the value of minsup is set to a lower value. It inherits the drawback of explosion of frequent itemsets generation and also consumes too much time, space

It is a bottom-up approach Liu et al  p r opo sed M S A pr i o ri w hi c h i s a n e xt e nsi o n o f  Apriori algorithm. MS-Apriori tries to mine frequent itemsets involving rare items. It assigns a minsup \(MIS\ value to each item and items having the MIS value higher than the lowest MIS value were used for generating frequent itemset. In that way this algorithm tried to overcome the rare itemset problem and was found more efficient than single minsup based algorithm. Rules which had Low support and high confidence were not identified by this algorithm. The reason for inefficiency of this algorithm was the removal of rules with higher MIS values Troiano et al. [7 aly zed th e pr o b lem of bo tt om u p approach algorithms that searches through many levels. For reducing the number of searches the author proposed the Rarity algorithm that starts with identification of longest transaction from database and search rare itemsets in top-down approach It avoids lower layers which contains frequent itemsets Candidates \(Rare itemsets\ are pruned in two different ways Adda et al. [8 r o pos ed A f R I M A l g o r ith m th at als o u s e s  top-down approach which is similar to the Rarity Algorithm Searches for rare items starts with the itemset having all items found in database. Pruning of candidates are same as Rarity Algorithm. It examined itemsets that had zero support, which was the major drawback of this algorithm Szathmary et al. [9 pr o p o s e d t w o alg o r ith m s th at can m i n e  rare itemset. In those algorithms three type of itemsets were defined: minimal generators \(MG\, minimal rare generators MRG\, and minimal zero generators \(MZG\ MRG-Exp Algorithm used MRG for generating candidates in bottom-up fashion by using MGs. The MRGs represents a boundary that separated the frequent and rare itemsets. Other algorithm ARIMA utilized these MRGs to generate the complete set of rare itemsets which was generated in MRG-Exp Algorithm When MZG reaches to border, this algorithm stops the search for non-zero rare itemsets. Because above that boundary there were only zero rare itemsets Koh et al  p rop o s ed A p ri or i I nver s e used t o m i ne perfect rare itemsets. Except that, at the initialization, this algorithm was similar to the Apriori. Only 1-itemset that fell below minsup was used to generate two itemsets. AprioriInverse inverts the downward-closure property of Apriori. For allowing Apriori Inverse to find near prefect rare itemsets, Koh et al. also proposed several modifications Han et al. [1 prop o s e d F P G r o w t h A l go r i t hm w hi c h use d frequent pattern tree \(FP-tree\ for storing transactions of database and reduce database scanning. One scan is for finding the items which satisfied minimum frequency support threshold; another scan is for initial FP-tree construction. This algorithm also supported multiple minsup framework Maximum Constraint Based Conditional Frequent Growth MCCFP-Growth\ Algorithm i s  e xt e nsi o n o f F P G ro w t h algorithm. MCCFP-growth algorithm involves three steps: one is tree construction, second is compact MIS-tree derivation and third is mining frequent patterns. This algorithm took more time for database scan because of item pruning. It also occupied more memory space RP-Tree Algorithm [13 is a m o d i f i c a ti o n  o f th e F P G r o w t h  algorithm. Similar to FP-Growth algorithm, this algorithm performs database scan for counting support. In the second scan for building initial tree, RP-Tree used the transactions having at least one rare item. In this way, the transactions having non-rare items were not included in RP-Tree construction. This algorithm tried to provide complete set of rare-item itemset. RP-Tree is an efficient algorithm that uses the tree data structure and identifies most rare association rules Most of the algorithms used the fundamental Apriori approach which is single minsup based frequent pattern mining technique. It had potentially expensive pruning steps and candidate generation. Those algorithms try to find out all rare itemsets but they spent most of the time in searching for nonrare itemsets which tends to provide uninteresting association rules. To address the \223rare item problem\224, \223multiple minsup framework\224 [6, 14  w a s use d t o d i sco ver r a r e  a s s o c i a t i o n  rules.  Different models were proposed in this framework They are: \(i\ minimum constraint model [6, 15, 17 i i   maximum constraint model [14   200  Minimum Constraint Model In this model, every item has minimum item support MIS\ith the use of minimal MIS value among all items minsup of pattern is represented. In this way, each pattern satisfies a different minsup value among the respected items within it. Instead of satisfying downward closure property, all pattern are satisfying sorted closure property A s per s o rted  closure property, \223all non-empty subsets of a frequent pattern need not be frequent, only the subsets consisting of the item having lowest MIS value within it should be frequent\224. Hence based on this model Apriori-like or F P g ro w t hl i k e  15, 18, 19 pproach es co n s i d er f requ e n t an d i n f requen t  patterns. The sorted closure property was briefly explored in    200  Maximum Constraint Model Maximum constraint model has been proposed in  In th i s  m odel MIS v al u e s  w ere g i v e n to each ite m a n d it  is known as frequent pattern only if it satisfies MIS values of all the items. This model was capable to mine uninteresting patterns but, issue was that only Apriori-like approach was used with this model. As this approach was having performance problem, we cannot extend it. With this motivation, we propose tree like approach that uses this model for finding rare patterns  The proposed Maximum Constraint based Rare Pattern Tree \(MCRP-Tree\ an improvement over existing algorithm in many ways. First is, it avoids expensive pruning step and item generation by using tree data structure based on FP-tree to find rare items. Second is, MCRP-Tree focuses on rare-item itemset which gives interesting rule and does not spend more time in finding non-rare-item itemsets which are uninteresting Third is, MCRP-Tree contains only rare items by excluding 


IEEE Sponsored 9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control \(ISCO\2015 the transactions which does not have rare items and also eliminate frequent items from the selected transactions. In the next section, we present the proposed approach which uses maximum constraint model for finding rare items III  M AXIMUM CONSTRAINT  BASED  RARE  PATTERN  TREE  MCRP-TREE A  Basic Concept: Rare Itemset The rare items are those that occur rarely in very few transactions and are normally pruned out. But rare items have significant use in many domains. Support and confidence are the factors used to identify the rare items among the dataset Rare items have lower support value but value of confidence is higher The minRareSup threshold works as a noise filter. The items are considered as a noise if they fall below this threshold An itemset is called as rare itemset if it has support above or equal to the minimum rare support threshold \(minRareSup\ but less than the minimum frequent support threshold minFreqSup For instance, suppose there are 4 items  with supports w = 0.80, x = 0.30, y = 0.50, and z = 0.12, with minFreqSup = 0.15 and minRareSup = 0.05. If the itemset  has a support of 0.09, then this itemset will be a nonrare-item itemset \(\(1\ above\ since all items are frequent, and its support lies between minFreqSup and minRareSup. The itemset  will be a rare-item itemset \(\(2\ above\ assuming that the support of  0.05, since the itemset includes the rare item z Formally, an itemset X is a rare itemset iff    An itemset X is a non-rare-item itemset iff       An itemset X is a rare-item itemset iff       The values of minimum rare support threshold minRareSup\d minimum frequent support threshold minFreqSup\e t according to the characteristics of the dataset  B  Maximum Constraint based Rare Pattern Tree MCRP-Tree RP-Tree algorithm is a frequent itemset mining algorithm which is a modification of the FP-Growth algorithm. It performs only one database scan for counting item support RP-Tree uses the transactions which consist of at least one rare item for building tree. In this way, transaction that doesn\222t have rare items cannot take part in RP-Tree construction. This algorithm requires minFreqSup and minRareSup in advance MCRP-Tree Algorithm shown in Algorithm 1 is the modification of RP-Tree algorithm. This algorithm accepts transactional dataset and similarly as RP-Tree, it perform only one database scan for counting support. With a prior knowledge of item\222s MIS value, this approach discovers the rare items from the dataset. MCRP-Tree select only those transactions which having at least one rare item in it. For example, if  was the rare itemset for given database then the transactions will have to contain at least one of  to avoid being pruned. At the time of tree construction, this approach takes only rare items and prunes other items from transaction. In this way, the proposed approach constructs only a rare item tree. For calculating MIS value for each item in the transaction dataset         Where is the support of item in the dataset  is the user specified lowest minimum item support allowed is used to control MIS value of ite ms according to their support Range of is 0 to 1 During insertion of items into tree, order of the item should be according to the frequency of item in original dataset and not according to the pruned tran saction dataset. It may be possible that rare items have higher support value than the frequent items. This is the reason behind not considering the support of pruned dataset. MCRP-Tree constructs conditional pattern base and conditional trees for each item existing in tree. In this way, MCRP-Tree will generate complete set of rare items   Algorithm 1. MCRP-Tree Input  Dataset  minFreqSup  Output rareItemsets  Initialization   countMIS items d countSupport items            Mining   for item i in tree  do  Build i\222s conditional pattern-base and then i\222s conditional FPTree      end for  return  rareItemsets    MCRP-Tree Example Let us consider a transactional dataset as shown in Table I A\ms  have support count 6, 6, 4, 4 2, 2, 1 and MIS values 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3 respectively. Value of Minimum Frequent Support is set to 5 \(minFreqSup=5\n item is said to be rare if its support is less than the Minimum Frequent Support and greater than the respective MIS value of that item. So  are the rare items identified by this algorithm and are included in rareItems   


IEEE Sponsored 9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control \(ISCO\2015 During the construction of MCRP-Tree, all the transactions are selected because each transaction has at least one rare item among rareItems If the transaction does not have any rare item, it cannot contribute into the construction of a tree. In addition, since the support of  is greater than minFreqSup and item fails to satisfy MIS value constraint they are ignored during construction of MCRP-Tree, as shown in Fig 2. The initial tree is constructed using RP-tree, which only ignores the items that falls below minRareSup=3, as shown in Fig 1. This RP-tree has 3 additional nodes that show frequent items as compared to the tree building using MCRPTree \(shown in Fig 2\. In addition, RP-tree does not contains  rare items as it removes the items having support less than minRareSup which is constant for each item in database MCRP-Tree builds conditional pattern bases and conditional tree to find the rare-item itemsets for each rare item   Fig  1. RP-Tree constructed from Dataset  Fig  2. MCRP-Tree constructed form Dataset IV  R ESULTS  From the literature survey we can determine that all algorithms can implemented in Java. With Brief survey experimental result for number of itemset generated and Time taken for itemset generation by ARIMA, FP-Growth and RPTree algorithm can be found. Due to the computationally expensive pruning steps and candidate generation, time taken by ARIMA is significantly greater. From the experiment we can say that runtime of ARIMA is 32 times greater than FPGrowth in all datasets. RP-Tree generated far fewer itemsets for some datasets in comparison to FP-Growth in majority of cases [9, 11, 13   MCRP-Tree is an extension of RP-Tree as it builds reduced tree with complete set of rare items and prunes all frequent nodes. With this approach we can reduce the time taken for itemset generation and can find complete set of rare items very efficiently as compared to the ARIMA, FP-Growth and RPTree algorithm. All existing algorithm spends most of the time finding rare items and as a result they identify non-rare or frequent items. For identifying complete set of rare items proposed approach provides two constraints i.e., minimum Frequent support and MIS value. Proposed approach removes the frequent items from the transactions during tree generation and builds tree with only rare items known as MCRP-Tree. As insertion of node in the tree is computationally expensive, this approach significantly reduces the execution time as compared to others With the help of literature survey we can provide tentative results that compare Time taken for Itemset generation and number of itemset generated by proposed algorithm with existing algorithm \(ARIMA, FP-Growth and RP-Tree\. We can easily estimate that proposed algorithms required less than half time for execution and generate less no of itemset   Fig  3. Number of Itemsets generated  Fig  4.

IEEE Sponsored 9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control \(ISCO\2015 V  C ONCLUSION  Data mining is one of the largest and challenging areas of research with the major topic \223Association Rule Mining\224. Most association rule mining techniques concentrate on finding frequent rules. But rare association rules are sometimes more useful and interesting than frequent association rules Maximum Constraint Model is most effective model for finding rare items. However, mining rare itemset using Apriorilike approach raises performance issues. We present a new effective method for finding complete rare itemset from large database. To our knowledge, proposed MCRP-Tree algorithm is a unique method which uses tree structure with maximum constraint model to mine rare items. The MCRP-Tree algorithm will consider only the rare items while constructing the tree from the dataset. Thus, the tree which takes most of the time for insertion of node is avoided. As a result the processing time for mining complete rare items will be minimized. The effectiveness of MCRP-Tree is shown by the tentative results R EFERENCES  1  R. Agrawal, T.

E Impacted Coef\002cient of the Additional Itemset De\002nition 13 The impacted coef\002cient of an additional itemset is to describe how effective this itemset is to manufacture the derivative itemset from underlying itemset denoted as AU G 001 X j X 0   de\002ned as AU G 001 X j X 0   r C 2 001 X j X 0   W 2 001 X j X 0  2 14 This equation averages the value of C 001 X  in Equation 9 and W 001 X  in Equation 11 Here we use the Quadratic Mean QM also known as Root-Mean Square to measure the signi\002cance of the itemset 001 X in terms of both utility and relationship perspectives because it represents the sample standard deviation of the difference between W and C  thus the result cannot be affected heavily by the smaller value It is easy to prove QM 2  X    X  2  033 2  X  15 Here X and 033  X  stand for the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation of W and C  We also tried another measurement by Harmonic Mean HM as a baseline which is proven to be less effective in our experiments For a speci\002c X 0  for each itemset 001 X to be considered the higher AUG means this itemset is likely to impel the underlying itemset into higher utility itemset On the contrary the lower the AUG is the lower utility that derivative itemset might be As all the AUG would be calculated only the largest AUG value itemset will be chosen F The CUARM Algorithm In this section an algorithm named Combined UtilityAssociation Rule Mining CUARM is proposed to discover all the actionable combined utility-association rules At the beginning of the algorithm it picks all UIs as candidates For each UI all the combined patterns are discovered with their AUGs which form a combined pattern cluster as in Equation 2 and only the most effective pattern would be selected In addition if two patterns are coupled with utility increment and decrement a combined pattern pair forms The input is the transaction database including all transactions with the utility of each item and the output is the combined pattern pairs their underlying itemset and the corresponding utilities In line 1 we prepare all the itemsets with their utilities in the alphabetical order and the length of longest itemset In lines 2-5 we start with each of the UIs named itemset 0 with its utility U 0  In lines 6-11 the DIs are ready and we calculate their AUGs In line 12-13 we select the pattern with max AUG values as CUAR V E XPERIMENTS In this section we conduct intensive experiments to evaluate the proposed methods Our experiments were run on a PC with a 2.30 GHz Intel Core 16 gigabyte memory

of the datasets are listed in Table VIII A Comparison of Two Functions for Calculating Impacted Coef\002cient Here we propose two functions for calculating the impacted coef\002cient One is the quadratic mean QM which is adopted in this paper the other function is the harmonic mean HM which is proved to be less accurate in the experiments Those itemsets with a good coef\002cient measurement should be associated with both high frequency and high utility growth we thus can separate the database randomly If the output itemsets discovered in each sub-database are stable we can assume that this measurement is suitable The experiments were conducted on the Retail dataset for the sake of simply examining the QM function The top 100 experimental results are selected and shown in Fig 4 The 002gure on the left shows the comparison between UP-Growth and QM while the 002gure on the right shows the result of QM and HM on C 001 X  and W 001 X   The database is split into 10 parts randomly The 002rst part contains 10 transactions in the database and each later part contains 10 more transactions than the former part such that the second part contains 20 and the last part is 100 The X axis is the k th  1 024 k 024 10  part of the database and the Y axis is the match ratio which means the ratio of the exact patterns found in the k th part 2

Fig 4 The Comparison of HM QM and UP-Growth matching with the  k  1 th part As seen from the 002gures the QM method outperforms both HM and UP-Growth B Experimental Evaluation of CUARM Next we present the experimental results of comparing derivative itemsets with the traditional HUIs FIs and UIs Underlying Itemsets respectively The statistic values of each dataset are shown in Table VIII The experiment is conducted as follows Firstly we collect all the utility itemsets with their utilities and frequencies in each dataset respectively Secondly we also collect all the frequent itemsets with their frequency and utility Then we calculate the utilities of the frequent itemsets frequencies of the HUIs and both utilities and frequencies of the derivative itemsets At last we plot the frequency of itemsets discovered via UP-Growth and CUARM the utility of itemsets discovered by FP-Growth and CUARM and the utility changes from each underlying itemset to derivative itemset as shown in Fig 5 Such exhibition is made for the comparison of our algorithm with FIM and HUI to demonstrate the UtilityAssociation Rules we discovered have both high utility and high frequency Here all the frequent and utility itemsets we compare with contain at least two items because the derivative itemsets our algorithm discover contain no less than two items Experiments on Real Datasets We 002rst present the outputs of dataset Retail in Fig 5\(a and Fig 5\(b Top 50 patterns of each algorithm are selected for experiments By analyzing the frequencies and utilities of patterns many of them are without much difference in both two experiments which means the association rules we found via traditional AR algorithms are also high utility-association rules via our method In addition such rules are also with high utilities This explains why some parts of the curves overlap In addition customers prefer to buy a few products at one time that is most of FIs and HUIs contain only one or two items which also explains the observations In datasets Chainstore  the differences are much clearer because customers usually prefer a variety of products in each of transactions and high utility itemsets are always low in frequency while highly frequent itemsets are with low utility For example in Fig 5\(d the CUARM performs much better than that of FP-Growth while in Fig 5\(e even at some points the performance is not so good the global performance is much better To sum up we can assert that the performance of our algorithm CUARM is much better than the others Experiments on Synthetic Datasets Experimental results on synthetic datasets t20i6d100k and c20d10k are shown in Fig 5\(g Fig 5\(h Fig 5\(j and Fig 5\(k The results are much clearer than those from real datasets because the items included are much neat and with orderliness For most of the patterns discovered via CUARM the frequencies are much higher than those traditional high utility itemsets At the same time most Utility-associated rules are also with much higher i.e twice the utility than traditional association rules especially in Fig 5\(h from dataset t20i6d100k  C Evaluation of the Utility Increment We demonstrate the utility increment in a graphic way to show how the utility increases from underlying itemset to derivative itemset The utility increment is valued based on the same datasets as above points are ordered by the utility of derivative itemsets The performance of our algorithm varies from one dataset to another The performance in chainstore is much better than that in retail because the transaction time in chainstore is 12 times more than that in retail while the item types are only twice more However in the synthetic datasets the performance is better In conclusion for each dataset the performance is different but the utility actually increases D Utility Variation Experiments Conclusion Based on the above datasets and experimental results a table is used to demonstrate the conclusion that comes from our experiments and shown as Table IX This table describes the number of itemsets whose utilities are increase or decrease with given threshold Also two kinds of utility incremental forms are listed One is the utility of derivative itemset is higher than both the utilities of underlying itemset and additional itemset which is denoted as FA the other is that the utility of derivative itemset is higher than only the utility of underlying itemset which is denoted as FB As for each underlying itemset only one derivative itemset would be discovered some FA and FB might be ignored For the utility decrement itemsets whose utilities are only lower than the underlying itemsets would not be considered in this table because these itemsets can also be regarded as FBs when the underlying itemsets and additional itemsets exchange TABLE IX U TILITY V ARIATION C ONCLUSION Dataset Min Sup N.DI R.U N.FA N.FB N.DecI Retail 0.01 89 20.3 50.4 28 22 39 0.008 135 18.6 50.4 37 46 52 0.002 1667
