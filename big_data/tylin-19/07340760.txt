Such rules are called association rules Methods and algorithms of Data Mining including also mining association rules are mainly built on processing of data represented in tabular form, where analyzed dataset are placed in to one column or into one line, i.e. they work in one dimension. At the same time similar relationships of data can exist in multidimensional data as well [3 o d eal with m u ltid i m en sion al cub e  OLAP cube\nstead of relational table data then an item set for mining association rules can be represented by a set of attribute values both each of dimensions and the range per totality of dimensions. If methods and algorithms of mining association rules in onedimensional data enough closely presented in publications, then similar methods and algorithms for multidimensional data are not yet sufficiently investigated II  R ELATED W ORK R EVIEW AND A NALYSES  OF U NSOLVED P ROBLEMS  In the paper question of c o m b ination OLAP technology with DM methods was considered. In particular there were attemp ts to extend function OLAP and of common use OLAP distributed server with DM infrastructure. As the result association rules were determined, which were represented in cubes and called Association Rule Cubes. In the paper  an ef fo rt was  made to generalize information in data cube and to expand OLAP operators by algorithms of association rules mining. A model was proposed as well that let to solve the problem of mining association rules, which also expanded SQL language by operator named META RULE [6 It is possible also to distinguish proposed method of mining association rules in data warehouses, that is based on organization of multidimensional data and able to extract association rules from several dimensions on different levels of  abstraction [7 well as g e n e ralized variant of mining association rules in OLAP cubes named Cubegrades [8  Finally it is worth to pay attention to approach of directed mining association rules process in data cube  and realized software on its basis named OLEMAR Online Environment for Mining Association Rules   But in mentioned papers formalized apparatus for detection of associations in multidimensional data in most cases is considered for relational multidimensional models \(ROLAP\ or for database in certain spheres Therefore it\222s desirable to develop more universal apparatus for mining inter-dimensional association rules in multidimensional data The goal of the research is a development of formalized apparatus for mi ning association rules in multidimensional data, represented by  OLAP cubes III  T HE R ESULTS OF THE R ESEARCH  Inter-dimensional association rules are the rules between attributes of different dimensions      xyz I IJJKK A DADAD    where I, J, K \226 corresponding indexes of dimensions which come into association rule I,J,K=1..n  n 226 number of dimensions in OLAP cube 226 dimension; x, y, z \226 corresponding indexes of dimensions attributes; x y, z 226

For example the next inter-dimensional association rules can exist xy I IJJ A DAD   In general minimum number of dimensions in association rule equal 2 and maximum number equal to number of dimensions in cube. I.e k=2..n where k is a number of dimensions in association rule n 226 total number of dimensions in cube For simplicity of understanding of mining interdimensional  association rules it is reasonable to represent their so called templates, which will differ from the rules that only corresponding dimension is pointed out in them instead of certain attribute of definite dimension, which in general can be written in the following manner l kj i DDDD      where DDDDD lkji  definite dimension of a set of dimensions i, j, k, l = 1..n 226 definite serial numbers of cube dimensions n \226 total number of cube dimensions Fairly large number of templates of association rules can be found from a cube, and it is absolutely reasonable question how many of them can be found and how generate all possible templates with a purpose of finding association rules with certain dimension values on their basis. Difficulties to the answer can be added by the fact that for random multidimensional cube total number of dimensions will be preliminary unknown. For its solving it is necessary to consider all possible relationships which may appear between dimensions It\222s clear for solid cube that the next templates of association rules exist The rules between two dimensions D 1  D 2 D 2  D 1  D 1  D 3 D 3  D 1  D 2  D 3 D 3  D 2  The rules between three dimensions in solid cube D 1 D 2  D 3  D 3  D 1 D 2  D 1 D 3  D 2  D 2  D 1 D 3  D 2 D 3  D 1  D 1  D 2 D 3   The more number of cube dimensions, the more difficult to find all possible templates of association rules between them The rules between two dimensions in fourdimensional cube D 1  D 2 D 2  D 1  D 1  D 3 D 3  D 1  D 1  D 4 D 4  D 1   D 2  D 3 D 3  D 2  D 2  D 4 D 4  D 2  D 3  D 4 D 4  D 3  The rules between three dimensions in fourdimensional cube The rules with one antecedent D 1  D 2 D 3 D 1  D 2 D 4 D 1  D 3 D 4  D 2  D 1 D 3 D 2  D 1 D 4 D 2  D 1 D 4  D 3  D 1 D 2 D 3  D 1 D 4 D 3  D 2 D 4  D 4  D 1 D 2 D 3  D 1 D 3 D 4  D 2 D 3  The rules with two antecedents D 1 D 2  D 3 D 1 D 2  D 4 D 1 D 3  D 2  D 1 D 3  D 4 D 1 D 4  D 2 D 1 D 4  D 3  D 2 D 3  D 1 D 2 D 3  D 4 D 2 D 4  D 1  D 2 D 4  D 3 D 3 D 4  D 1 D 3 D 4  D 2  The rules between four dimensions in fourdimensional cube The rules with one antecedent D 1  D 2 D 3 D 4 D 2  D 1 D 3 D 4  D 3  D 1 D 2 D 4 D 4  D 1 D 2 D 3  The rules with two antecedents D 1 D 2  D 3 D 4 D 3 D 4  D 1 D 2  D 1 D 3  D 2 D 4 D 2 D 4  D 1 D 3  D 1 D 4  D 2 D 3 D 2 D 3  D 1 D 4  The rules with three antecedents D 1 D 2 D 3  D 4 D 1 D 2 D 4  D 3  D 1 D 3 D 4  D 2 D 2 D 3 D 4  D 1  For generation of templates of association rules for a cube with random number of dimensions let\222s introduce the following notation n \226 total number of dimensions in a cube k \226 number of dimensions in definite association rule k=2..n i \226 number of dimensions in antecedent of  association rule   \(i=1..k \226 1 The next algorithm of association rules generation is proposed 1  Let\222s imagine a set of all dimensions 123      n DDDD D  2  Let\222s consider number of dimensions in possible association rules: for the case of four-dimensional cube it is possible to generate association rules with two, three and four dimensions, i.e k=2..4  3  For each k consider number of dimensions which can be in antecedent of a rule i

After that it is possible to insert n-i dimensions into consequent of given template, provided that such dimensions, which did not enter into antecedent. It is necessary for that to subtract corresponding element of the set D from the set D that will form the next set   j DDM which will have n-i of elements 6  Form the set M that consists of all possible combinations of the set D with a number k-i of elements i.e ik in CMP  where ik in C number of dimension combinations of multidimensional cube from their multitude, which have a number n-i of elements in amount k-i  7  Insert by turn corresponding element of the set D into consequent in template of association rule Let\222s apply pointed out algorithm by an example of multidimensional cube, which contains four  dimensions i.e n=4;  D={D1, D2, D3, D4 k=2..4.

371 This is due to that during consideration of multidimensional data absolutely different cube dimensions are processed and then their associations Generally a multitude of all frequent item sets in OLAP cube is the set S  21 ni SSSSS  where i 226 number of elements in the item set S i 226 multitude of frequent item sets with number of elements  n 226 total amount of elements in the cube In turn sets S 1 205,S n contain different item sets for each dimension or for totality of dimensions if number of elements in the set is larger than one I.e  211 n sssS  where s 1 226 multitude of frequent item sets for the first cube dimension s 2 226 for the second dimension s n 226 for the n-dimension In turn set of two-element item sets can be represented as follows  13122 mn sssS  where s 12 226 multitude of frequent item sets per totality of the first and second dimension s 13 226 per totality of the first and third dimensions m n  Let k be a number of elements in an item set Therefore in general  k n k C i k iii k sS 1   21  It\222s quite clear that during generation of frequent item sets in OLAP cube all elements, which are presented in corresponding cube dimensions, will not get into them For inclusion of element or their totality into such sets it\222s necessary at first to calculate support of this totality Support of a totality of elements from multidimensional cube has a slightly another meaning in comparison with support of a se t in transaction, but on the other hand given concepts are similar for multidimensional and relational data model relatively Support of a set in transaction database is equal to ratio of number of transaction, which has this set, to total number of transactions. In turn for calculation of support of the set from multidimensional database instead of a number of transactions it is necessary to use value of a cell, which totality of values of dimension attributes responds to relevant item set Let\222s denote value of dimension in definite cube cell as n nt iiii M  21 where i t 226 index of t cube dimension A possible value for t  is ni t  0 if t cube dimension has fixed value 0 t i if t-dimension is followed by aggregation On the basis of described above, the resulting cube value will be denoted as  n M 0,...,0,0  Let\222s denote nt iiiii  21 and  n ALL 0,...,0,0 Then a support of multidimensional set from a cube will be equal to relation of corresponding value of a cube dimension in a cell that has given set, to general cube value ALL i M M iSup   So as to add definite set to frequent sets, it is necessary that its value of support would be larger or equal to user-defined value of minimal support MinSup Sup i  Algorithm of generation of all frequent item sets must include generation of k sets of elements, where k=1..n  The most simple is generation of one-element sets, so far as its implementation needs to sort out all values of attributes of every dimension separately from each other not combining them It is proposed to create frequent item set in the form of a list, in which the first element is a list with serial numbers of cube dimensions by means of which generation of set is implemented \(so called \221a list in a list\222\one-element set such sub-list will contain one element only. This sub-list in the first element in further generation of association rules on the basis of item sets will serve for identification of dimensions by means of which all sets were generated All next elements of the list i.e. from the first to the last will contain information about found given item set Generally the list has the next format          z z k kz z z k k k k val valval valvalval id idid sup sup   2 1 1 1 21 11 2 1  where k 226 number of elements in item set id i 226 serial number of idimension of cube in corresponding item set val ij  226 value of attribute of cube\222s idimension in corresponding j item set supp j 226 value of support of jitem  set z 226 obtained number of frequent item sets  Elements of sub-list with cube dimension numbers id 1 205,id i 205,id k play a role of so called keys by which values in item sets are obtained. Such format of the list is enough convenient for further search of all interdimensional association rules 


372 Generation of frequent one-element sets will be implemented as many times as a number of combinations with one element 1 N C with two elements 2 N C and so on In this connection generation of frequent sets with a number of larger than one, use set lists, obtained on previous steps   n n i SetSetSet MasOfSets  1   MasOfSets 226 general list of frequent  sets Set i 226 list of frequent item sets with a number of elements i  n 226 total amount of dimensions in a cube i=1..n      i n i i i i C idid idid i subset subset Set   1 1   where  i i idid subset  1 226 list of frequent ielement item sets on dimensions with identificators i idid  1  General list of all frequent item sets in multidimensional data becomes a basis for generation of inter-dimensional association rules Support of association rule is equal to support of frequent item set whereby it is developed. This statement becomes clear thanks to that given item set includes both antecedent and consequent of association rule Confidence of association rule in multidimensional data may be represented as relation of cube dimension value for dimensions which are pointed out together in both antecedent and consequent to aggregate cube value on dimensions which are pointed out in antecedent only For example there is a cube with three dimensions which are denoted as D 1  D 2 and D 3  Let a cell exists in this cube with the values of dimensions accordingly equal to x, y and z. Let\222s accept that the next association rule exists  3 2 1 zDyDxDR    So its confidence will be equal to 0   yx zyx M M RConf  Accordingly lift as a relatio n of antecedent occurrence rate in transaction, which have consequent as well, to antecedent occurrence rate will be defined for association rule in large z xy xyz z xy xyz MM MM M M M M zSupp RConf RLift 000 000 000 00 0      In turn leverage as a difference between cooccurrence rate of antecedent and consequent and product of occurrence rates of antecedent and consequent be defined for association rule as 2 000 000 000 000 00 000 0 000  M MMMM M M M M M M zSuppyxSuppRSuppRLev z xy xyz z xy xyz     IV  T HE I MPLEMENTATION OF R ESEARCH  The above presented method of inter-dimensional association rules generation in multidimensional data was implemented in the frame of intelligent information system, which became the result of OLAP and Data Mining integration by the example of detection of associations with object databases. The system was implemented in the environment of Cach\351 databases object control system by means of CSP \(Cach\351 Server Pages\ technology The investigation resulted in the information system which consists of four modules 1\The database \(DB\ design module \(or the metadata module 2\ The DB management module \(or the data module 3\ The OLAP subsystem module 4\ The data mining module The system has been implemented in Cach\351 DBMS by means of Cach\351 Objects server and constitutes totality of CSP pages. The system\222s main page is a page of the database scheme selection for further work with it. It\222s possible also to come over from this page to the pages of creating a new packet, or dele ting an existing one as well as to check out the list of the primitive data types in the system. The list of existing data scheme is presented on the main page in tabular form; thereby the name of the scheme is a link, which leads to the page of required packet description. Further on it is possible to work either with metadata or object region data. The screenshot of the main page of the implemented information system is presented in Fig. 1  Figure 1  The main page of the system 


373  The proposed method of association rules generation was implemented in the data mining module A block of pages is responsible for inter-dimensional association rules generation in the system. It includes a page of rule context obtaining and also three pages of associations generation regardless of their type \226 context or full First, let us examine the page of inter-dimensional association rule context obtain ing. If the end-user has a task to generate precisely this type of rules, a corresponding link leads to it on the page of cube data revision. In its turn the present page proposes the user to set specific values of cube dimensions and at the same time restricts their introduction by condition that not all dimensions must have specific values. Their number must not exceed N-2, where N \226 total number of dimensions If specific value was set for corresponding dimension it will enter the rule context. For context rules generation at least two dimensions must not have specific values because such number is minimal for existence of association rule, in which one dimension will be in its condition and another \226 in its consequence. The screenshot of the context obtaining page is presented in Fig. 2  Figure 2  The page of inter-dimensional association rule context obtaining When pressing the OK button on the above page transition will be completed to the first page of the association rules generation pages. Designation of this page is that with its help the end-user can set custom values of minimal support and certainty \(in %\ the system If the end-user leaves em pty margins for entry of marked values, minimal support and certainty automatically will be equated with 0%, which means generation of maximum possible frequent item sets and inter-dimensional association rules. It is possible to start their generation passing through the obtaining context step. In this case full inter-dimensional association rules will be generated. A typical image of the described page is presented in Fig. 3  Figure 3  The first page of inter-dimensional association rules generation system In turn the second page of the association rules generation pages takes values of minimal support and certainty inserted by the user and initiates a script, that consists of the functions which develop frequent item sets in multidimensional data As a result this page outputs all obtained item sets with a value of support, that is less or equal to its inserted minimal value At first frequent item data sets of one dimension are displayed, then of two dimensions and so on to total amount of dimensions, if such item sets belong to category of frequent by values of their support. Example of this page image in the frame of September 2011 with 223Month\224 value dimension is presented in Fig. 4 The last third page accordingly reflects the last step which is a final generation of inter-dimensional association rules. This page displays a table of all rules which have overcome a threshold of minimal certainty The screenshot of this page is presented in figure 5 It is noteworthy that the rules will be kept in DB until the end-user will define new rules context and cube measure, by which the rules should be generated, as well as new minimal values of support and certainty. In this case old association rules which were kept in DB will be removed and replaced by new rules generated according desired conditions. Association rules are kept in DB not for a long time but temporarily. But the system has an option of keeping of association rules in a text file, thanks 


374 to which they can be considered in any time regardless whether they are stored in DB for the moment or were removed by this time  Figure 4  The second page of the inter-dimensiona l association rules generation system  Figure 5  The third page of the inter-dimensiona l association rules generation system V  C ONCLUSION AND P ERSPECTIVES  An approach was proposed for creation of templates for inter-dimensional association rules by generation of all possible combinations of dimensions in OLAP cube by which possible association rules are available, as well as a method of frequent item sets generation in OLAP cubes, on basis of which association rules can be generated corresponding to obtained templates  R EFERENCES  1  A.

paying a price of a slightly worse ratio for subsets Taken together the price of having more subsets is preferred because subsets contain only items actually in the assembly while superset and overlap patterns also contain unrelated items The 002rst and second row of 002gure 8 correspond to the instance and the pattern-based approach for graded synchrony The third corresponds to the instance-based approach for binary synchrony Comparing the diagrams for unrelated patterns our graded method detects all injected patterns 050\002rst and second rows\051 while the binary method also produces unrelated pattern In 050Borgelt et al 2015\051 it is demonstrated that the instance-based approach yields slightly better results than the pattern approach However this approach does not consider the precision of synchrony Surprisingly using only the pattern-based approach with a graded notion of synchrony yields a better ratio for overlap and superset patterns 7 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we presented a method to detect frequent synchronous patterns in event sequences using a graded notion of synchrony for mining patterns in the presence of imprecise synchrony of events constituting occurrences and selective participation 050incomplete occurrences\051 Our method adapts methods presented in the literature to tackle selective participation using binary synchrony especially the instancebased approach which looks at instances of patterns to improve the detection by removing instances that are likely chance events checking the precision of synchrony of these instances We demonstrate in our experiments that using a graded notion of synchrony for support computation helps to simplify the detection of selective participation because a pattern-based approach yields better results or at least equally good results as an instance-based approach This is a considerable advantage since identifying the individual pattern instances is costly and thus it is desirable to avoid it ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work presented in this paper was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness 050MINECO Grant TIN2012-31372\051 and by the Principality of
