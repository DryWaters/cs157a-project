nIn order to evaluate the data we have to know the number \nof students who have used the system to download the \ntutorials of basic Computer Science. You can see this in table \nI. According to the table we can see I have taught more than \none thousand three hundred mechanical engineering students \nin the second semester in the last five years. \nTABLE I.   THE NUMBER OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS BY \nYEARS IN THE SECOND SEMESTER \nYears Students population \n2008-2009 2nd semester 152 \n2009-2010 2nd semester 172 \n2010-2011 2nd semester 272 \n2011-2012 2nd semester 297 \n2012-2013 2nd semester 391 \n \nThe analyzing of the download of learning material and the \nconclusion on the learning habits of students based on this \npopulation: \nB. The frequency of downloads before the test \nWe can draw the inference on learning habits after \nanalysing the distribution of downloads before the test. The \nnext two charts show frequency of downloads depending on ntime. In the first chart we can see the frequency of downloads \nbefore the first test \(Fig. 1 next chart the \nfrequency of downloads before the second test in the second \nsemester is shown \(Fig. 2 nYou can see now that most downloads took place the day \nbefore the first test. It is important to notice the high number \nof downloads on the day of the test too \(Fig. 1 most downloads \ntook place on the day before the test \(Fig. 2 before the first test \n \n \nFig. 2. The frequency of downloads before the second test \nIf we spend more time looking at these charts, we can see \nthe frequency of downloads before the test did not change in \nthe last five years against the different didactical teaching \nmethods [4], [5], [6]. These methods were good to get the \nstudents better results on how to download the material in time \nbefore the test but the big part of the students can not pass the \nexam. They are not interested in this subject and they \ndownload the learning material just one day before the test.  \nC. The relationship between the distribution of download and \nthe number of days before the test \nWe have seen earlier the highest number of downloads of \nthe learning material was one day before the test and the \nsecond biggest one was on the day of the test in the last five \nyears in the second semester. Now we have to calculate the \ncorrelation coefficient to see the measures of association n\(Table II nYears Correlation coefficient \n2008-2009 2nd semester -0,59* \n2009-2010 2nd semester -0,61* \n2010-2011 2nd semester -0,57* \n2011-2012 2nd semester -0,58* \n2012-2013 2nd semester -0,58* \n*the correlation is significant at the 0.01 level \n \nAccording to the table we can see the negative correlation \nbetween the distribution of downloads and the number of days \nbefore the test. It means if the number of days before the test \nare lower in this case the number of downloads are bigger. It is \nnot surprising because the charts show the same situation.  \nThese correlation coefficient values show the measures of \nassociation, i.e. how strong the connection between \ndistribution of downloads and the number of days before the \ntest is. The calculated values mean there are middle strong \nnegative correlation existing between the distribution of \ndownloads of the learning material and the number of days \nbefore the test. We can see strong connection in the second nsemester in 2010.  \nWe can see that the learning habit of freshmen student has \nnot changed in the last five years. The big part of students \nwaited to download the learning material one day before the \ntest or on the day of the test. This learning time is not enough \nto pass the test. \nIII. CONCLUSION \nWe could see after the analyzing of the distribution of \ndownloads of the learning materials in the second semester in \nthe last five years the learning habit of students has not \nchanged.  \nWe have found strong negative correlation between the ndistribution of downloads and the number of days before the \ntest. It means that the overwhelming part of students \ndownloaded the teaching material on the day of test or the \nprevious day and they waited for the last moment before the \ntest to download the learning material and learn it.  \nThey are not enough motivated to read the material at \nhome week in week out and they cannot pass the exams too. \nMy colleagues have same experience at the university.  \nIV. FUTURE WORK \nWe have to try to motivate the students to learn the nmaterial week in week out to modify the learning habit. The \nstudents could write every week a short test from the learning \nmaterial of the previous presentation after that we can see how \nthe learning habit of the students has changed.  \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] B.

The above problem is a natural one to be solved\nusing simulation optimization. This will be done by extending the process-oriented Model class\nprovided by ScalaTion. The ERModel class \(see supplement represented by instances of the Resource\nclass. The input to the model is a VectorI which contains staffing levels for the model. The\nexternal arrival and service time distributions for each staff member are modeled according to\nExponential distributions with rates from ? and µ . Two different kinds of patients are generated in\nthis model, WalkInPatients and AmbulancePatients. Their arrival distributions are based\non the external arrival rates found in ? . Upon arrival, they are assigned a severity level of 0 \(low high Bernoulli distribution where the probability of receiving a 1 is 25%. The\nmodel itself is constructed by defining the sources, sinks, resources, queues and transportss for the\nmodel as well as defining the script for each actor involved in the simulation \(the model’s screenshot\n\(Figure 1 the supplement.

Now that the objective function, u\(x optimized. As this is an INLP optimization problem, ScalaTion’s\nIntegerTabuSearch optimizer for Tabu Search Glover and Laguna 1998 x to the high computational demands of simulation optimization, one may\nattempt to use a simpler analytic modeling technique, such as Queueing Networks. In ScalaTion, the\nJacksonNet class can be used to determine the steady-state distribution for a network of M/M/c\nqueues. The technique discussed is limited by two serious assumptions. The model only works\nif the inter-arrival times of patients into the network follow a Poisson process and service times\nare Exponentially distributed. More general types of Queueing Networks \(e.g., BCMP models are\nplanned for the future. Still, they will have limiting assumptions compared to simulation models.\nThe derived queueing model for the Emergency Department model can be found in the supplement.\nThe objective function is defined using the steady-state results and is analogous to the one given\nin the last section.\n• Multiple Linear Regression. Several factors can affect the staffing decisions, including the hourly\npay rates for the various types of staff members, the costs of supplies, etc. We use Multiple\nLinear Regression \(MLR discussed above, have limitations: Discrete-event Simulation used in simulation\noptimization can be very time consuming, even when run on a cluster. Queueing Networks provide\nsolutions more rapidly, but their accuracy can be questioned when their assumptions are violated.\nAn important issue for MLR is the issue of getting the data; recall the earlier discussion of data-rich,\nknowledge-poor vs. data-poor, knowledge-rich. Clearly, it is important to collect real-world data,\neven simulation models need data. The data requirements for applying Multiple Linear Regression\nare much greater. Of course, there is no reason why simulation can not supply the regression models\nwith some data, as is done in Response Surface Methodology \(Carley et al. 2004 regression\nmodels can therefore be used for interpolation, limited extrapolation and optimization reducing\nthe need for more time-consuming simulation runs.\n6 APPLICATION TO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT\nIn this paper we claim that predictive analytics is more reliant on data, while simulation modeling is more\nreliant on 


knowledge. Effectively combining data and knowledge can lead to more accurate and informative\nmodeling. Supply chain management is one of the most mature fields of analytics and provides excellent\nsupport for our claims A wide variety of time-dependent predictive analytics techniques are used in\nsupply chain management to forecast product demand \(Box and Jenkins 1976 see\nsupplement demand feed the overall supply chain process, whose goal is to provide\ninventory to satisfy demand on a continuing basis. Simulation is often used to assess whether a supply\nchain will truly satisfy demand in the presence of a variety of uncertainties such as forecast error, supplier\nlead time, manufacturing lead time and manufacturing yield. Here are a few of the many examples of\nsupply chain simulation:\n• IBM Europe PC Study: In the mid-1990s, IBM performed simulation modeling to develop a\nbetter understanding of its personal computer supply chain in Europe \(Feigin et al. 1996 excessive inventory. A manufacturing plant\nin Scotland was the primary source for PCs. The manufacturing execution strategy was Build To\n1198\nMiller, Cotterell, and Buckley\nForecast and there were distribution centers and transshipment points in each European country. A\ndiscrete-event simulation model was built, along with a number of optimization models.\n• IBM Asset Management Tool \(AMT global supply\nchain re-engineering effort whose goal was to achieve quick customer responsiveness with minimal\ninventory in the IBM global supply chain. To support this effort, an extended enterprise supply chain\nanalysis tool, AMT, was developed \(Lin et al. 2000 modeling,\nanalytical performance optimization, and discrete event simulation to study a wide range of issues\nincluding inventory budgets, turnover objectives, customer service level targets, and effects of new\nproduct introduction.\n• IBM Pandemic Business Impact Modeler: In 2006, IBM developed a simulation model to\nunderstand how a pandemic might impact a manufacturing companys employees and business\nperformance Chen-Ritzo et al. 2007 see supplement to examine epidemiological, behavioral, economic, infrastructure, value\nchain, and financial aspects of the IBM ecosystem. The sub-models were constructed using a\ncombination of system dynamics simulation, time step simulation, and linear programming.\nIn the above examples, predictive analytics and simulation modeling are used in combination to predict\nimportant supply chain results. There is a key difference in how uncertainty is treated in the two techniques.\nIn the predictive analytics example, data are analyzed to generate a forecasted quantity, with uncertainty in\nthe forecast expressed as a probability distribution \(generally referred to as forecast error distributions, and assess the impact\nof the samples on the modeled processes. The simulation models generate an array of output values, which\ncan be converted back into probability distributions using output analysis In essence, predictive analytics\nturns data into distributions, while simulation modeling turns distributions into data.\nThe parameters of our predictive model must be trained on historical data in order to create a reasonably\naccurate forecasting engine. Similarly, the parameters of our simulation models must be calibrated against\nhistorical data in order to create “valid models” that reliably predict demand satisfaction. After validation,\nit is common to perturb a supply chain simulation model using what-if analysis by changing parameters,\npolicies, processes, or network structures in an attempt to improve the ability of the supply chain to satisfy\ndemand. At this point, supply chain simulation has gone beyond being a pure predictor and has become a\ntool to improve the supply chain. This was in fact the purpose of the simulation models described above,\nwhose results were as follows:\n• IBM Europe PC Study: $40M of savings were realized per year by removing many distribution\ncenters and transshipment points, and changing the manufacturing execution strategy from Build\nTo Forecast to a variant of Build To Order \(see Figure 4 in supplement Tool \(AMT generated by AMT included more than $750M of savings in\nmaterial costs and price protection expenses in 1998 leading to IBM receiving the 1999 Franz\nEdelman award.\n• IBM Pandemic Business Impact Modeler: The results of the model suggested that closing airports\nand establishing alternative suppliers and fulfillment sites may be the most effective combination\nfor mitigating the impact of a pandemic on the revenue of a manufacturer subject to a number of\nassumptions about the manufacturer.\nPredictive analytics can also be extended to improve a supply chain. A forecasting engine operates\nby identifying the relationship between demand and selected demand drivers such as historical demand,\nweather, and prices. While historical demand and weather cannot be changed, prices can. Therefore, a\ndemand forecasting engine can be used to improve a supply chain by leveraging its model of price elasticity\nto project price recommendations that increase demand \(Dietrich et al. 2012 example of using predictive analytics to\nimprove a supply chain. The goal was to improve the on-time delivery 


of a group of consumer products from\na manufacturing site to a set of retail distribution centers. The analysis involved monitoring a large set of\nmetrics across the supply chain over time and correlating exceptions in those metrics to late deliveries at the\nretail distribution centers, using a predictive analytic technique called Temporal Causal Modeling \(Arnold\net al. 2007 traditional mining of causality beyond statistical\ncorrelations to temporal relationships. The proof of concept identified five metrics, including forecast\naccuracy and distribution center capacity, which had the most impact on late deliveries. Improving these\nfive metrics indicated a potential to significantly improve on-time delivery. However, the predictive model\ndid not indicate how to improve the five metrics in supply chain operations. The next step in improving\nthis supply chain may be to create a detailed simulation model focusing on the processes impacting the\nfive most important metrics. In this way, the two techniques can work together to efficiently model and\nimprove a supply chain.\nA third example of using predictive analytics to improve a supply chain is an IBM tool called Quality\nEarly Warning System \(IBM 2012 for early identification of quality issues with\na low rate of false alarms. It automatically predicts defect trends before such trends can be triggered by\ntraditional, industry standard Statistical Process Control techniques. It is used by IBM in its manufacturing,\ndevelopment, procurement, and field warranty processes Like the second example, this tool can be used\nto identify processes that need to be modeled in more detail to enable improved results. The tool saved\nIBM over $38M in quality related costs since its deployment in 2008.\nIn summary, the examples presented prove that predictive analytics and simulation modeling are\nimportant techniques for supply chain management. Both techniques can be used for prediction, one\nrelying purely on the data and the other on a combination of knowledge and data. Both techniques go\nbeyond pure prediction to enabling improvements in a modeled process through what-if analysis. Predictive\nmodels focus mainly on metrics and have little knowledge of underlying processes. Simulation models\nrely on deep knowledge about processes and provide a more detailed and flexible way to evaluate potential\nprocess changes. Together these technologies provide an efficient methodology to determine the focus\nareas of a process and analyze potential improvements to the process.\n7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nAnalytics and modeling is a vast landscape with numerous competing and complementary techniques.\nPositioning these techniques along a modeling continuum as well as creating taxonomies and ontologies to\ndescribe and inter-relate them can help illuminate this vast landscape. From the available knowledge, data\nand purpose of a particular modeling study, the appropriate techniques can be chosen from the modeling\ncontinuum.\nThe ScalaTion package, which provides a wide selection of techniques for analytics and modeling,\ncan be used as a testbed for exploring trade-offs along the modeling continuum. The examples given\nin this paper represents a preliminary study of some of the trade-offs. An integrated environment like\nScalaTion supporting a modeling continuum would clearly be advantageous for supply chain management\nprofessionals. The development of models using ScalaTion can be assisted by utilizing the DeMO and\nSoPT ontologies. Models can be created manually, with GUI designers, or generated from instances in\nontologies. Example code generators are available on the Web \(see supplement place, an additional issue becomes how to take Web accessible knowledge and\nbig data and assist modelers and/or domain specialists in creating predictive models. Preliminary work has\nbegun on this with the DeMOforge project. To handle larger scale predictive analytics, simulation models and\nsimulation optimization, work has begun to parallelize ScalaTion to run on multi-core clusters. Additional\nfuture work includes developing an ontology to support predictive analytics, handling of multiple ontologies,\nsearching for relevant ontologies using rules to suggest modeling techniques relevant to a particular problem,\nand searching open linked data and on-line databases for additional information.\n1200\nMiller, Cotterell, and Buckley\nREFERENCES\nAgrawal, D S.

Existing clinical functional elec-\ntrical stimulation systems use the patient’s residual movement to activate muscles and \nrestore simple grasp. We have developed a BMI to control muscle activation, allowing \n monkey subjects to pick up and move objects despite complete paralysis of the flexor muscles below the el-\nbow. Such a system could restore voluntary movements to SCI patients through normal cognitive processes.  \nHowever, a critical remaining issue is the need to restore proprioception, the loss of which largely eliminates \nthe ability to plan movement dynamics. Neurons in the somatosensory cortex signal limb movement with dis-\ncharge that is broadly tuned to a “preferred direction 


By stimulating small groups of electrodes with similar \npreferred directions, we can induce perceptions of limb motion similar to those caused by actual limb move-\nment. We are developing a neuroprosthesis that would restore a sense of limb state to SCI patients. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Lee E.

Hunter Peckham \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE Neuroprostheses for Movement Restoration \n \nAbstract: Major advances have been made over the past decade in use of neuropros-\ntheses for restoration of motor function.  These advances have been built on the fun-\ndamental science of neural excitation and the technologies for implantable stimulation \nand control. The technologies have advanced to provide operational systems that func-\ntion in the human body for decades, and include implantable electrodes, stimulation \ndevices, and sensors.  The neural interface between the excitable tissue and the delivery electrode are ena-\nbling evermore powerful control and precision in the delivery of stimulation, not only providing for excita-\ntion but also blocking of neural activity \(e.g. for annihilation of pain or spasticity interfaces are currently in development \nthat will provide greater flexibility in implementation and performance. \n \nThe clinical manifestations of these findings are the available systems that have been created, and are being \ndeveloped, to restore function.  These include many areas of the body for people with spinal cord injury, \nincluding hand grasp, standing and walking, breathing, and bladder and bowel control Several patients \nhave benefited from systems that enable more than one function \(e.g. hand function and bladder control restore full \narm mobility and levels of standing and ambulation.  Several areas where future advances are likely to meet \nclinical challenges will be discussed.   \n \nBiographical Sketch: P. Hunter Peckham is currently at the Institute for Functional Restoration, or IFR, at \nCase Western Reserve University \(CWRU deploys neuroprosthetic interventions into clinical use to re-\nstore the functions lost due to spinal cord injury or other paralytic conditions.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
