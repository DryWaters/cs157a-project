partition the stream into multiple\nsub-streams, then we risk the three tweets being partitioned\nbetween the two sub-streams, resulting in fragmentation\nand reduced evidence for decision making. Hence, we need\nan more advanced strategy for scaling event detection,\nwhich does not compromise effectiveness as parallelism is\nincreased.\nWe propose a new event detection approach that aims to\nprovide effective scalable low-latency event detection over\nBig Data streams, while avoiding effectiveness degradation\nlike that described above. We refer to this approach in\nour later experiments as Distributed Lexical Key Parti-\ntioning. This approach is based on two main concepts.\nFirst, inspired by state-of-the-art event detection approaches\n\(see Section II-A approximate strategies to estimate the\ndistance from the closest document to d should be used\nto maintain constant time per-document processing. In par-\nticular, each document should be represented using one or\nmore lexical keys k and a single spacial representation v.\nThe closest document is then calculated ?rst within local\nkey-partitioned document clusters, reducing the comparison\nspace and avoiding event detection latency increasing over\ntime. Second, the underlying distance estimation for a sin-\ngle document should be partitioned and parallelised across\nmultiple machines, rather than partitioning the stream and\nparallelising the processing of each subset. This facilitates\nthe scaling of event detection to big data streams without\ndegrading event detection effectiveness. Based upon these\ntwo concepts, we propose four distinct processing phases\nthat describe a general event detection approach where each\nphase can be independently parallelised, namely: Repre-\nsentation; Local Clustering; Global Clustering; and Event\nDetection. Figure 1 illustrates each of the four phases of\nour approach.\nA. Event Detection as a Storm Topology\nDistributed Lexical Key Partitioning is generic and can\nbe implemented using a variety of platforms and/or pro-\ngramming languages. For our subsequent experiments we\nimplemented it as a Storm topology as illustrated in Figure 2.\nObserve that each phase of our approach is implemented\nas one or more Storm bolts, which can be individually\nreplicated. Each copy of a bolt is referred to as a bolt\ninstance. In particular, the representation phase is spread\nFigure 2. Our approach implemented as a Storm topology.\nover two bolts, namely Vectorisation that converts each\ndocument into its spacial representation v; and the Key-\nGrouped Hashing bolt that produces \(70 multiple keys are produced to improve\nthe accuracy of the distance estimation key generation and represent documents in\nvector-space, as these have been previously shown to be\neffective for non-distributed event detection [12].\nThe local distance comparison phase of our approach\nis represented by the Local Cosine Distance Calculation\n\(LCDC to a subset of the possible hash keys ?. For\neach hash key k? ? ?, the bolt maintains a ?xed-size rst-\nin-?rst-out \(FIFO 30 it is textually\ncompared using cosine comparison to the other documents in\nthe bin for k?, returning the identi?er of the closest document\ndocidj and the distance to that document dist\nk?\ndi?dj\n.\nEach of the potential closest documents identi?ed are\nemitted, grouped by their id docidi and then sent to the\nglobal clustering phase of our approach. This phase is\nrepresented by the Global Cosine Distance Calculation &\nError Correction bolt, which ?nds the closest of all of the\ndocuments \(based on the emitted distances 12],\nthis bolt also performs a further error correction function by\nchecking whether any of the most recent m documents are\ncloser that those previously found.\nThe ?nal phase of our proposed approach; Event Clus-\ntering is represented by the K-Means Clustering bolt. This\nbolt maintains clusters of documents based upon the closest\ndocument found. A threshold ? is used to determine whether\neach incoming document should be added to an existing\ncluster or should form a new cluster. If a document has\nbeen added to an existing cluster, that cluster is emitted as\na new event if its size is greater than ? \(5 have not been emitted after an\nhour since their creation.\nB. Optimisations for Storm\nNotably, using a distributed stream processing platform\nlike Storm to process high-volume data streams can incur\nadditional overheads. In particular, each bolt maintains input\nand output message queues and messages from different\n545\nFigure 3. Event Detection using sub-stream partitioning in Storm.\nbolts on a variety of machines that need to be routed across\nthe network and grouped at their destinations. Moreover,\nsince multiple bolts are chained together, a single document\nwill be processed sequentially by each bolt \(and possibly\nby multiple instances of a single bolt as well processing\nthousands of documents each second can be in the tens or\nhundreds of thousands. Hence, to avoid excessive overheads\nfrom message passing, we introduce two optimisations to\nthe topology.\nFirst, we introduce buffering and aggregation of messages\nat the representation phase. In particular, rather than emitting\nonce per key k? produced for a document, we instead\nbuffer documents for each key, emitting them as compressed\nmessages multiple times each second. By producing fewer\nmessages, we can reduce the size of the 


message queues\nand enable each message to be better compressed. Second,\nat the local distance calculation phase, we pre-calculate the\nglobal distance calculation instance that each document will\nbe grouped at. We use this to group multiple documents and\nthe calculated distances for those documents together. This\noptimisation is similar to the role that a combiner plays in\nMapReduce; reducing the number of emits and hence the\ntime spent sorting/shuf?ing messages between bolts.\nIV. AN ALTERNATIVE EVENT DETECTION TOPOLOGY\nRecall that one of the main motivations for our proposed\napproach was to avoid effectiveness degradation while scal-\ning, which can occur when approaches that partition the\ndocument stream are used. In this section, we describe an\nalternative event detection approach and associated Storm\ntopology that implements such a stream partitioning strategy,\nwhich we use as a baseline in our later experiments. In\nparticular, given a high-volume input stream, a natural\napproach would be to arbitrarily partition that stream into\nsmaller sub-streams. Given an event detection approach with\na maximum throughput x, that approach can be replicated\nand deployed on each sub-stream so long as the rate at which\ndocuments arrive on a single sub-stream does not exceed x.\nThe events detected from each effective sub-stream can then\nbe merged into a global event stream as a ?nal step.\nFigure 3 illustrates how this approach can be implemented\nas a Storm topology \(assuming the same event detection\napproach by [12] is used, as before evenly In/Out Sub-stream Partitioning Distributed Lexical Key Partitioning\nVectorisation In < docidi, doci, ti >\nOut docidi, vi, ti >\nDocument-Grouped Hashing / In < docidi, vi, ti > < docidi, vi, ti >\nKey-Grouped Hashing Out docidi, vi, k\n?[], ti > < k\n?, [vi, docidi, ti] >\nCollision Detection and In \(1  k\n?, [vi, docidi, ti] >\nDistance Calculation / Out \(1  In \(2  2  nError Correction / In < docidi, ti, docidj , distj > < docidi, [ti, docidj , distj ] >\nGlobal Distance Calculation Out < docidi, ti, docidj , distj > < docidi, ti, docidj , distj >\nEvent Clustering In < docidi ti, docidj , distj >\nOut < docid[] >\nmultiple sub-streams. Documents assigned to each sub-\nstream are converted into their vector representation v within\nthe vectorisation bolt, as before. The vectorised documents\nare then hashed locally \(creating bins local to each sub-\nstream hashing bolt. Each\ndocument is then emitted along with all of its hash keys\n\(grouping by document rather than grouping by key collision detection bolt\nand subsequently compared to ?nd the closest within the\ndistance calculation bolt This is followed by Petrovic et al’s\nerror correction step [12] as a separate bolt. The resultant\ndistance is then used to determine whether an existing local\nevent cluster for the current sub-stream would be updated or\na new event cluster for that sub-stream created, as per our\nproposed approach. All local events are then merged into a\nglobal event stream. We refer to this approach in our later\nexperiments as Sub-stream Partitioning.\nTable I illustrates the differences between the sub-stream\npartitioning and our distributed lexical key partitioning\ntopologies in terms of the input and output formats for their\nbolts. From Table I, we see that sub-stream partitioning\ndiffers from our approach in two critical ways. First, the\nstream is partitioned into multiple sub-streams rather than\npartitioning on the coarse-grained \(hash output\nof the hashing bolt changes from one emit per document\nin the sub-stream partitioning topology containing multiple\nhash keys for that document, to periodic emits of multiple\ndocuments per hash key under our approach. Second, rather\nthan spreading the distance computation of a single doc-\nument over multiple machines by having each bolt process\nindividual hashes, documents are processed fully using a pair\nof bolts namely collision detection and distance calculation.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nDataset: To evaluate the effectiveness, ef?ciency, latency\nand scalability of event detection, we require a large stream\nof documents covering an extended time-period covering\nmultiple noteworthy events. Twitter is currently one of the\nlargest social media sources – producing over 160 billion\nposts each year – and has been shown to be a good\nsource of information about events as they happen [4].\nHence, we use a Twitter dataset containing a sample of 51\nmillion tweets from the period of the June 30th 2011 to\n546\nTable II\nMAXIMUM PER-BOLT THROUGHPUT AND AVERAGE PROCESSING LATENCY OF THE TWO EVENT DETECTION TOPOLOGIES. † INDICATES THAT THE\nTHROUGHPUT IS ESTIMATED BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF HASHES NEEDED TO PROCESS ONE TWEET.\nTopology Measure Storm Bolts\nSub-stream Partitioning Vectorisation Document-Grouped Collision Distance Error K-Means\nHashing Detection Calculation Correction Clustering\nThroughput \(tweets/sec 5ms <0.05ms\nDistributed Lexical Vectorisation Key-Grouped Local Distance Global Dist.

collected\nusing the public streaming API. From an effectiveness\nevaluation perspective, although this dataset represents only\na fraction of the full Twitter stream, it still covers multiple\nnoteworthy events, including the death of Amy Winehouse\nand the Moscow Airport Bombing among others. From an\nef?ciency/scalability perspective, high volume streams can\nbe simulated by controlling the rate at which tweets are\ningested by the topology.\nEvents: From the above dataset, we manually identi?ed 27\nmajor events, which we use as the ground truth for our\nsystem to detect. For each event, we manually searched the\ndataset starting from the time when each event occurred with\nthe aim of ?nding tweets about each. From this search, we\nfound a total of 117,983 tweets over the 27 events.\nHardware: For our experiments, we use a cluster of ma-\nchines, where each machine contains two 64bit quad-core\n2.13GHz processors \(8-core connected together by a gigabit\nEthernet switch on a single rack. Another machine outside\nthis cluster is used for Storm topology control.\nMeasures: We evaluate the ef?ciency of our topologies and\nthe individual bolts that comprise them by measuring their\nthroughput in terms of the maximum number of tweets that\nthey can process per second, denoted tweets/sec. Due to\nsmall variances in the maximum throughout, we report the\naverage throughput over three runs. Topology scalability is\nmeasured in comparison to linear scaling, i.e when doubling\nthe number of processing cores doubles the throughput. The\naim is to achieve as close to linear scaling as possible.\nSince our topologies are complex and bolts have different\nthroughput rates, the replication factor of multiple bolts\nneed to be increased concurrently to avoid bottlenecking\non those bolts that were not replicated. Hence, the linear\nscaling factor \(gradient the\nnumber of processing cores needed to increase throughput\nin a stable manner. Finally, we measure the effectiveness of\nevent detection in terms of event detection recall, i.e. how\nmany of the 27 events were identi?ed by our system. In this\ncase, an event is considered identi?ed if the system emits a\ncluster that contains 3 or more tweets about the event.\nBaselines: We compare our distributed lexical key partition-\ning approach in terms of effectiveness, ef?ciency, latency\nFigure 4. Event detection recall over the 27 identi?ed events for the two\ntopologies at different degrees of parallelism.\nand scalability against the sub-stream partitioning approach\ndescribed in Section IV. All event detection parameters were\nset as per the single stream approach that both topologies\nwere based upon [12].\nVI. RESULTS\nThrough experimentation, we investigate three research\nquestions in relation to our approach for real-time event\ndetection, each in a separate section:\n• How is effectiveness impacted by parallelisation in\ncomparison to the baseline topology?\n• How ef?cient is our event detection approach in com-\nparison to our baseline topology and are low levels of\nprocessing latency maintained?\n• Does our approach facilitate event detection that scales\nclose to linearly with processing capacity and can it\nkeep-up with the full Twitter Firehose stream?\nA. Effectiveness\nWe begin by evaluating our ?rst research question, i.e.\nhow is effectiveness impacted by parallelisation under both\nour approach and the alternative sub-stream partitioning\ntopology. Recall from Section III that we noted that sub-\nstream partitioning approaches may cause event detection\neffectiveness to degrade when parallelism is increased, since\nthe aggregate of events detected from parts of the stream\nare not equivalent to events detected from the whole steam.\nAn effective event detection topology will maintain its per-\nformance regardless of the degree of parallelism employed.\nAs such, we evaluate the topology generated using our\nproposed event detection approach in comparison to the\nbaseline topology described in Section IV.\n547\n 0\n 500\n 1000\n 1500\n 2000\n 2500\n 3000\n 3500\n 10  15  20  25  30  35\nT\nh\nr\no\nu\ng\nh\np\nu\nt\n n\(\nt\nw\ne\ne\nt\ns\n/\ns\ne\nc\n 7-core scaling factor a Sub-stream Partitioning\n 0\n 500\n 1000\n 1500\n 2000\n 2500\n 3000\n 3500\n 5  10  15  20  25  30 35\nT\nh\nr\no\nu\ng\nh\np\nu\nt\n \n\(\nt\nw\ne\ne\nt\ns\n/\ns\ne\nc\n 8-core scaling factor b the two event detection topologies in terms of tweets/sec as we increase the number of processing cores allocated in comparison\nto linear scaling \(using a scaling factor of 7 cores and 8 cores per increment respectively to which the process\nis parallelised across multiple machines. N degrees of paral-\nlelism indicates that each bolt within the topology is repli-\ncated N times. From Figure 4, we see the following. First,\nthat for both topologies, an event recall of approximately\n55% is achieved when only one degree of parallelism is\nused, i.e 15 of the 27 events in our dataset were identi?ed.\nSecond, we see that as we increase the degree of parallelism,\nthe effectiveness of our proposed approach remains stable,\nwhile the sub-stream partitioning topologies effectiveness\ndegrades. Indeed, over 18% absolute recall is lost moving\nfrom one to three degree’s of parallelism, which represents\nonly a fraction of the parallelism that we would need to\nprocess the entire Twitter Firehose stream \(as we show later\nin Section VI-C 


key-based partitioning scheme for attaining parallelism\nrather than partitioning over the tweets themselves Hence,\nin answer to our ?rst research question, we conclude that\nour proposed approach is more effective than the baseline\napproach as it maintains event detection recall while scaling.\nB. Ef?ciency and Latency\nHaving shown that our approach is more effective than\nthe baseline approach, we next evaluate the ef?ciency of it\nin comparison to the baseline topology. Indeed, for a real-\ntime event detection system to be useful, the topology needs\nto be suf?ciently ef?cient, i.e. such that it can be scaled\nusing relatively few machines. To evaluate how ef?cient our\ntwo topologies are, we simulate high-volume streams by\nfeeding a 1 million tweet sub-sample of our dataset through\neach at very high input rates \(up to 5000 tweets/sec maximum rate at which each individual bolt\ncan process tweets \(when no bottlenecks are present maximum throughput over three tests, reporting the\naverage. Table II reports the throughput of each Storm\nbolt within both topologies. A higher throughput indicates\nthat the bolt is more ef?cient. Note that for our proposed\napproach, the data is partitioned by hash rather than by\ndocument \(tweet measure tweets\nprocessed each second for the local distance calculation bolt\n\(where each buffered emit represents one hash and multiple\ndocuments needed to process a single tweet.\nFrom Table II, we observe the following. First, the\nthroughput of the bolts can vary greatly within a single\ntopology. For instance, under our proposed approach, the\nfastest bolt was vectorisation; processing over 4000 tweets\nevery second, while the slowest was the local distance\ncalculation bolt, processing just over 100 each second. This\nis important, since in a deployment scenario we would\nwant to best utilise the available compute resources, i.e. not\nreplicate bolts more than needed to serve the input stream\n\(with some spare capacity to deal with ?uctuations in load as expected,\nthey differ mainly in terms of the bolts that perform the\ndistance calculations and subsequent error correction \(addi-\ntional distance computations computation over three bolts, each able\nto process between 340 and 266 tweets each second. In\ncontrast, under our proposed event detection approach, the\nsame computation is performed using just two bolts; local\ndistance calculation which is more computationally expen-\nsive and global distance calculation, which is less expensive.\nOverall, the throughput for both topologies are close to\nequal, although sub-stream partitioning does demonstrate a\nslight advantage in overall throughput.\nFinally, since the aim of event detection is to identify\nevents as quickly as possible, it is important to minimise\nlatency within the topology. Table II also reports the average\nper-bolt processing latency for a single tweet within each\ntopology. From Table II, we observe that the processing\ntime a tweet spends within each single bolt is 1-5ms. The\nexceptions are the key-grouped hashing and local distance\ncalculation bolts from our proposed approach, which buffer\ntweets to minimise network traf?c as described in Sec-\ntion III-B and hence have longer latencies between emits\n\(10-100ms equivalent in\nterms of ef?ciency and maintain very low processing laten-\ncies for event detection.\nC Scalability\nHaving shown that unlike the baseline approach, our\nproposed approach maintains event detection effectiveness,\n548\nTable III\nSAMPLE TOPOLOGY CONFIGURATIONS THAT CAN PERFORM EVENT DETECTION OVER THE ENTIRE TWITTER FIREHOSE STREAM.\nTopology Storm Bolts Total Throughput\nVectorisation Hashing Collision Distance Error K-Means\nDetection Calculation Correction Clustering\nSub-stream Partitioning 2 12 18 18 18 2 70 4864\nDistributed Lexical Key Partitioning 2 14 40 14 2 72 4518\nwhile using similar levels of processing power We next\ninvestigate our third research question, i.e. is our approach\nscalable to high volume streams. To this end, we report\nthe maximum overall throughput observed as we increase\nthe number of processing cores allocated to perform event\ndetection. A scalable event detection topology should scale\nclose to linearly with processing power allocated, i.e. dou-\nbling the processing cores should also double the topology\nthroughput. The linear scaling factor indicates how many\ncores are needed to double the throughput from the ?rst\ndata-point. Note that since each bolt in a topology can not\nachieve the same throughput, it is expected that some bolts\nmay be under-utilised in each con?guration. In all cases, the\nreplication factor of each bolt is chosen to minimise under-\nutilisation \(based upon the per-bolt throughputs observed in\nSection VI-B a b the maximum\noverall throughput of the two event detection topologies in\nterms of tweets/sec as we increase the number of processing\ncores allocated in comparison to linear scaling.\nFrom Figure 5, we observe that both topologies scale in a\nclose to linear fashion, i.e. the throughput of both topologies\nincreases in a consistent manner to the number of processing\ncores allocated. This indicates that both topologies would\nbe suitable for processing of high volume streams \(although\nwe showed previously that event detection recall degrades\nwhen using the sub-stream partitioning topology sub-stream partitioning\ntopology is slightly lower \(7 8 


sub-stream partitioning is slightly\nmore ef?cient, i.e. fewer cores are needed to double the\nthroughput supporting our observations from Section VI-B.\nFinally, to illustrate a practical deployment of these\ntopologies, we perform an additional scaling experiment to\ndetermine how many processing cores would be needed to\nprocess the entire Twitter Firehose stream \(4500 tweets/sec con?guration for each of the\ntwo topologies and the resultant throughput. From Table III,\nwe observe that approximately 70 processing cores are\nneeded to process the entire Twitter Firehose stream, or\napproximately 9 8-core machines.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nWe introduced a new scalable event detection approach\nto tackle the dif?cult task of online event detection using\nembarrassingly high volume social streams. This approach\nuses a novel lexical key partitioning strategy to spread the\nevent detection process across multiple machines while\navoiding divide-and-conquer strategies that partition and\nprocess the stream as a series of sub-sets. We described an\nimplementation of this approach within Storm, distributing\na state-of-the-art event detection system. Through experi-\nmentation of a large Twitter dataset, we showed that the\nproposed approach is able to ef?ciently scale to big data\nstreams providing thousands of tweets every second, without\ndegrading event detection effectiveness.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors acknowledge ?nancial support for the ReD-\nites Project from EPSRC grant EP/L010690/1.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.

Thus the \ncodeword buffering delay for DSN missions and \nSN/NEN missions are 3x2048/R and 3x4500/R \nrespectively \(in unit of seconds

As ground transmission latency \nis a small fraction compared to the other delays, we \nuse the rough estimation of two times propagation \ndelay to model the ground transmission delay.   \n \nUsing the Straight-Forward Leveling Scheme we estimate \nthe link sizes of the network paths of the four ISE options \nfor the “base” case and high” case traffic scenarios, both \nfor bulk science latency requirements of 1 hour and 8 hours nrespectively.

All other links are store-and-forward links, and the \nlink sizes are driven by the combined effects of nmission data rates, data types with different latency \nrequirements, and duty cycles.   \n3. For ISE-3 and ISE-4, the aggregated WAN \nbandwidths are insensitive to data type latency \nrequirements as their WAN bandwidths are \ndominated by the real-time GSS-INOC links.   \n4. For ISE-4 with two different bulk science latency \nrequirements, the aggregated WAN bandwidths for \nthe high-case are only 20% higher than those of the nnominal case.  This is because the ISE-4 WAN \nbandwidths are dominated by GSS-INOC links that \ntransport RF/IF samples, and are independent of \nthe data rates.   \n5. For ISE-3, ISE-4, and ISE-5, the aggregated WAN nbandwidths of the “high” case are approximately \nthree times as those of the “base” case.  This is nconsistent with the fact that the “high” case \nconsists of future mission data rates that are 3 times \nthose of the “base” case.   \n6. The WAN bandwidths of ISE-3 and ISE-4 are \nmuch higher than those of ISE-1 and ISE-2.   \n \n \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK \n \nIn this paper, we describe new leveling schemes to model \nthe traffic flow and buffering mechanism of a large-scale \nstore-and-forward network.  We apply these techniques to \nestimate the wide area network \(WAN options of the \nproposed Integrated Space Communication and Navigation \n\(ScaN improve the fidelity \nof the leveling schemes and enhance the INA Study are as \nfollows:   \n1. Use statistical description to define link bandwidth \nrequirements.  The current analysis uses the min-\nmax approach to estimate the link sizes of a \nnetwork as described in Section 4.  A better \napproach to quantify the link sizes is to describe \nthe individual link size in terms of mean and \nvariance based on the simulated traffic that flows \nthrough the link.  By invoking the Gaussian \nassumption and using the 2nd order statistics ngathered from the traffic flow simulation, one can \nspecify the link sizes based on the statistical nconfidence level to prevent overflow.   \n2. Provide data type modeling for each individual \nmission.  The current analysis makes blanket \nassumptions on mission data types across all the \nmissions as described in 


Section 4.  When data \ntype allocation information is available for an \nindividual mission, we can implement the specific \ndata type allocation for that particular mission to \nimprove the simulation fidelity.   \n3 Include other latency contributions.  The current \nanalysis only models the store-and-forward delay \nbased on the latency requirements of the data types, \nwhich accounts for the majority of the latency in \nthe data delivery operation.  We can improve the \naccuracy of the analysis by modeling the additional \nlatency contribution of codeword buffering delay, \nframe buffering delay, and ground transmission \ndelay as described in Section 4.   \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe authors would like to thank John Segui for his \nengineering and simulation support, and Loren Clare for his \ninsightful comments.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
