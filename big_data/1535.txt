Monopole antenna possesses 
wide-band frequency characteristic and high radiation efficiency It is easy to be designed and manufactured with guarantee consistency, but with the fatal flaw of a large size. Helical antenna can provide sufficient bandwidth for transferring data generate circular polarized wave. It can reduce the axial size to sixty percent, but must be with comparatively big radial dimension to acquire the excellent performance. The advantages of micro-strip antenna are light weight, compact size, relatively thin thickness, and so on. And the last kind of antenna still requires aggressive miniaturization to meet the requirements of the wireless capsule endoscope. Techniques for miniaturization of antenna mainly include a ground plane, double-layer patch 
shorting pin or wall, lossless high dielectric substrate, and the spiral structure. The influence of humane tissue on the antenna behavior must be considered. So the relationship between the antenna and issue was analyzed in this article to improve the antenna characteristic such as return loss, input impedance and standing wave ratio Keywords-wireless capsule endoscope; miniaturization;human tissue; micro-strip antenna I   I NTRODUCTION  Wireless capsule endoscope has become increasingly attractive for low cost visualization of the status of organs health 1 It contains image sensor, optics and illumination, a 
transceiver, a system control with image data compression unit and a power supply. It can examine the disease of the small intestine, but also be used for tissue samples and biopsy or treatment 2 In order to check the organs clearly, wireless capsule endoscope must be required to transmit the high quality image faster. But the signal is easily interfered by other radio-frequency signals and can be attenuated by the humane tissue during transferring image package. In order to enhance the anti-interference ability, the author designed the optimized transceiver mode with channel changing 3 Although these methods can enhance the ability of wireless endoscope RF communication for transferring image package, the 
characteristic of antenna must be enhanced to ensure the data transfer The selection of frequency for wireless capsule endoscope is complicated. The electrical properties of human tissue directly affect the frequency. The magnetic permeability of humane tissue is same as that of vacuum. But the permittivity and conductivity of humane tissue are depended on the frequency. Because of the high water content of humane tissue the absorption of electromagnetic power increases with frequency. At higher frequencies, the increased electrical spacing between an antenna and the body counteracts losses in biological tissues W. G. Scanlon et al 5, 6 used the FDTD techniques and the 
Visible Human Dataset to simulate the body-worn antenna for 418MHz, 916.5MHz and 2.45GHz, which means that bodyworn antenna suffers from reduced efficiency due to electromagnetic absorption in tissue, radiation pattern fragmentation and variations in feed-point impedance at UHF and microwave. Despite with much higher tissue losses at 2.45GHz, antenna performs surprisingly well in this band. L C. Chirwa et al 7,8 considered the effect of the human tissue on the propagation of radio signals from a wireless ingested diagnostic device in the gastro-intestinal tract. Unfortunately they only researched at the frequency  from 150MHz to 1.2GHz. And they studied the radiation emitted from two 
representative antennas built into an ingested medical device and indicated the maximum radiation occurs between 450MHz and 900MHz. And Q. H. Meng et al   estimated attenuation at the four ISM bands from 100MHz to 6GHz with a simplified experimental model. The result showed 915MHz and 2.45GHz were good choices for the wireless link because of their relatively large electrical size of antenna. And there are many prototypes of wireless capsule endoscope used the frequency of 2.45GHz 10,1  This article firstly analyzes the type of small-size antenna and compares the merits and flaws. Besides that, it studies the miniaturization technique of micro-strip antenna. Finally, it 
simulates the performance of antenna using the mean parameter of human tissue at the frequency of 2.45GHz II  A NTENNA ANALYSIS  Antenna is an important part of radio frequency micro device. It requires reducing size as small as possible without changing the characteristic parameter. Because, after wireless capsule endoscope is swallowed into the gastro-intestinal tract the receiving instrument need to be worn on the abdomen. The radio signals are required traveling no less than fifty cm 978-1-4244-4713-8/10/$25.00 \2512010 IEEE 


through intestinal wall, muscle, bone, nervous, connective tissue, skin, especially other organs. These human-antenna interactions effect electromagnetic performance of the antenna by changing antenna input impedance, modifying the antenna radiation patterns and absorbing antenna delivered power. And the reflection of different tissue border causes the multipath fading to modify the polarization direction. Therefore, the antenna elements must ideally possess these features The ideal antenna for the wireless capsule endoscope should be with low profile and un-obstructive to the gastrointestinal tract. The difficulty comes from the disturbing of biological tissues to the antenna’s electromagnetic characteristics. In order to degrade the coupling of tissue and electromagnetic wave to avoid performance degradation and health risks, new antenna must be less susceptible to human tissue influence The system need transfer the image data from the wireless capsule endoscope to out of body. With the high resolution of the image sensor, the data volumes lineally increase. The antenna must be enough wide bandwidth to accommodate spread-spectrum schemes The antenna is encapsulated with the image sensor, control unit, power, and so on. Low-profile physical geometry makes it facilitative be encapsulated. Usually the antenna has a diameter of no more than 1cm. There are some other components should to be considered. And the thickness of antenna should be as thin as possible A  The mini- type antenna  Because of the wide-band frequency characteristic and high radiation efficiency, monopole antenna is used to portable communication device. And it usually appears in the electronic systems with facility to design and manufacture for guarantying consistency. But the size of the antenna is big especially in length. According to the theory of electromagnetic wave propagate, the length of antenna is usually the quarter of the wave length. When the carrier frequency of the system is 2.45GHz, the length of monopole antenna reaches to thirty mm When taking account of the tissue electromagnetic characteristic, the length could be shorter. Even so, it is hard to encapsulate the antenna into the wireless capsule endoscope Helical antenna is regarded as the modified monopole antenna by hovering the line to reduce the axial distance. The size of helical antenna can be decreased by forty percent Helical antenna can provide the same performance as the monopole antenna, provide sufficient bandwidth for transferring data, and generate circular polarized wave. Helical antenna owns the normal mode and the axial mode. In the axial mode, the maximum radiation is along axial direction. And the radiation field is circularly polarized field. In the normal mode the physical dimensions of the antenna, such as perimeter and pitch, are much smaller than the wavelength. The maximum radiation is in a plane normal to the orientation of the antenna The helix can be approximately composed of series small loops and dipoles, whose diameter is equal to the diameter of the helix, and length is equal to the pitch of the helix, respectively It can reduce the axial size to sixty percent, but must use comparatively big radial dimension to acquire the excellent performance. And in order to acquire the excellent performance, helix must strictly ensure the diameter, pitch and number of turns Micro-strip antenna includes micro-strip traveling wave antenna, micro-strip patch antenna and micro-strip slot antenna Micro-strip traveling wave antenna is composed of substrate periodic structure or quasi TEM transmission line and a ground plane. The last two parts cover on the two sides of the substrate respectively. Micro-strip patch antenna consists of a single metal patch suspend over a ground plane. Patch antenna is easily to be fabricated,, modified and customized. Micro-strip slot antenna is composed of micro-strip feed line and the ground plane with slot. Micro-strip patch and slot antenna are attractive to be used in many applications as they have a low profile, and are light weight, comfortable and easy to integrate with wireless capsule endoscope Although these antennas have different advantages, the performance of the first two antennas will deteriorate rapidly by reduced in size. Micro-strip antenna has a compact structure but is hardly integrated into the wireless capsule endoscope Consequently, miniaturization needs be researched to further reduce the size of antenna B  The miniaturization technique  The purpose of the miniaturization technique is to get smaller dimension without significant reducing performance Micro-strip patch antenna owns such features as flexibility consistency, and optional shape. Therefore, the research hot point at present is the relatively shorter micro-strip antenna that can reduce the volume of the antenna considerably Technology for miniaturization of antenna mainly includes a ground plane, double-layer patch, shorting pin or wall, lossless high dielectric substrate, and the spiral structure The multi-layer of micro-strip antenna has a remarkable feature which has a length of sixty percent and a bandwidth of four times of the conventional patch, and good crosspolarization characteristic The shorting wall leads to a quarter-wave patch. One of the vertical walls is connected to the lower patch, and the other is connected to the ground without touching the lower patch This structure reduces the resonant frequency and attains a bandwidth enhancement Adding a shorting pin in close proximity to the probe feed reduce the resonant length. The shorting pin is capacitively coupled to the resonant circuit of the patch, which effectively increased the permittivity of the substrate. It has been shown that a shorting pin in suitably place can reduce the resonant length to one third, and the area of the patch to one ninth. The shorting pin and the feed are generally placed at opposite sides of the patch. If the pin is placed close to the feed, which is the case for the rectangular patch, the antenna fails to function properly 12  Very roughly, the resonant frequency of the patch antenna is inversely proportional to the square root of the permittivity  of material. To reduce the dimension of the antenna, highpermittivity material substrate layer is used. The substrate is capable of protecting surrounding tissue from the RF energy 


and decreasing the frequency sensitivity of the antenna affected by the electrical char acteristics of the biological tissues The shape of the patch antenna is rectangular or circular Spiral and serpentine micro-strip antennas are significantly smaller than a traditional rectangular patch. Their radiation pattern at the resonant frequency is same as PIFA. The serpentine antenna has a higher resonant frequency for the same physical length, and is more difficult to design 1  C  The summary of antenna  As a conclusion, the multi-layer patch antenna is complicated, and limited to reduce the size. The structure of shorting-wall needs relatively big space to implement. In the system of wireless capsule endoscope, the techniques of shorting pin, high-permittivity substrate, and spiral shape will be adopted S. I. Kwak et al 14 proposed a wideband small spiral antenna which had size of 10.1mm diameter and 3mm height The impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna is from 430 to 500MHz for VSWR<2. And it has isotropic radiation pattern. The antenna used the RF35-A as the dielectric substrate with dielectric constant of 3.5, thickness of 1.524mm and the metallic thickness of 0.0173mm. B. Huang et al 15  designed a four spiral slot using high dielectric substrate materials and adding a short strip for  capsule endoscope. The antenna is 8.25*8.25*0.6mm integrated into the capsule. The resonant frequency is 915MHz. Xiang Xie et al 16 designed a less than 9mm diameter micro-strip antenna using the shorting pin and F4BK35 substrate. It resonates at 2.45GHz while the impedance bandwidth reaches 104MHz And, S. Jacobsen et al 17 concentrated on the single-arm micro-strip antenna. It showed that micro-strip single-arm Archimedean spiral antennas owned excellent medium coupling, insensitivity to different tissue properties and applicator positioning, broad band-with, and circularly symmetric radiation fields  So the Archimedean spiral patch antenna is a wise choice III  S IMULATION  On the basis of analyzing the mini-type antenna and the miniaturization techniques, this paper adopts the resonant frequency of 2.45GHz, shorting pin and high-permittivity substrate to design the Archimedean spiral patch antenna for wireless capsule endoscope. The concept diagram is shown in Fig 1  Fig 1. Concept diagram of the Archimedes spiral antenna  The influence between human tissue and antenna is an important factor of propagating electromagnetic wave. During designing the antenna, the tissue must be taken into account The tissue around the antenna could change its performance such as the radiation efficiency, resonant frequency, input impedance, and radiation mode. Characteristic parameters change along with  different distance, different frequency, and other factors. Therefore, it is very important that the antenna is quantitatively analyzed by electromagnetic measurement to simulate the situation The endoscope encapsulated the antenna is shown in Fig 2 There is image sensor, the optic system, controlling unite and power source in the right part of the capsule. The dielectric material is vacuum in the capsule. According to the FCC document, when the average muscle tissue dielectric parameters is at 2.45GHz, dielectric constant is 53.6 and conductivity is 1.8   Fig 2. Diagram of capsule within antenna module  The same antenna is simulated in the condition that there is vacuum and muscle around the wireless capsule endoscope respectively. The result of return loss is shown in Fig 3   A\ tissue                   \(B\out tissue  Fig 3. Correlation curve of return loss and frequency  During the antenna is surrounded by tissue, the resonant frequency reduced quickly. It will help to miniaturize the antenna IV  C ONCLUSIONS  The miniaturization of antenna is very important. And it is a hard task in the system of wireless capsule endoscope. First of all, a suitable type of antenna must be selected, such as the helical antenna, the spiral antenna, and so on. Then one or many miniaturization techniques, like shorting pin or lossless high dielectric substrate, must be chosen to reduce the compact and enhance the performance. At last, a simulate software is used to analyze these parameters and adjust the dimension to acquire the excellent antenna according to the real case A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research was supported in part by Chongqing Education Committee\(Grant No.KJ090517\ and the Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing CSTC 2009BB5284

 5 changes to the technical ba seline, and communicating the approved changes in subsequent revisions of the document Focusing on the key areas of a technical baseline, the technical parameters, operational concepts, risks, and tests are the areas that should be continuously evaluated for quantifiable changes.  If these areas are monitored and changes controlled and communicated through a formal process the technical baselin e becomes the authoritative source for technical data on th e project and an excellent measure of the progress and changes at the end of the project 5  I NFORMATION T ECHNOLOGY P ROJECT T ECHNICAL B ASELINE I MPLEMENTATION  The Information Technology \(IT\ where the technical baseline concept was implemented was the Unified Messaging System \(UMS\S is an IT project that transitioned all 7,000 JPL electronic mail client users from the Eudora mail client to Microsoft Outlook Exchange. When I joined the project it was already underway and had been operating with a high-level project management plan that included a schedule and deliverables Roles and responsibilities, tec hnical parameters, risks and mitigations and test protocols had not been defined.  Most of these items were recognized as activities that would take place at some point in the pr oject but were not documented or planned.  Figure 2 below is a sample diagram from the JPL UMS Communication Plan.  It is a diagram of the JPL UMS system and with the exception of some software builds and version documentation was the most technical part of the documentation.  Needless to say there were many other more technical parameters, activities, and tests that needed to be documented and communicated to the team  Figure 2: JPL Unified Messaging System Diagram IT Projects have similarities with large-scale engineering projects such as space systems because of their technical nature, large stakeholder base, and need for test and redundancy.  Unfortunately IT projects are managed like an average work project and the t echnical parameters that are so important to all of the st akeholders are treated as an afterthought.  The UMS project was no exception after the first five months of operation.  We immediately recognized that the project was struggling mostly with stakeholder communication, an authoritativ e source for technical data and a test plan to avoid rework and mitigate risks By implementing the technical baseline concept we had used so often on space programs and other large scale engineering projects our team was able to bring discipline back to the project in a few ke y areas that helped bring the whole project around and heading in the right direction Some of the most positive results from the technical baseline documentation were ar eas where discipline in the approach and execution were critical to success and controlling scope creep and rework.   The top three areas with positive results are listed here and described further in this section  Stakeholder Communication  Authoritative Source for Technical Data  Test Plan  Five months into the project communication between stakeholders had broken down in some critical areas such as implementation and training and was non-existent in other areas such as test planning.  Exacerbating the communication issue was the lack of an authoritative source for Technical Data for the stake holders to use.  As a result when communication did occur and decisions were made there was no mechanism to eith er reference the baseline to ensure scope compliance or make note of the revision to the baseline and documentation of any impacts to the scope change.  The test plan was another critical area that had difficulty gaining momentum until a technical baseline was implemented and the team had a common set of parameters to plan for in their test system and test scenario preparation If these three areas had not had a common baseline for the project to work from, to document revisions, and to use for communication the project would have continued to drift and been at major risk of extreme cost and schedule growth  Stakeholder Communication One of the most important lessons learned from the benefit of implementing a technical baseline on the UMS project was using it as a communication vehicle within the project team and to project stake holders.  Once the system characteristics, key design factors risks, and test plans were documented in one baseline all of the stakeholders had a place to go first to answer ques tions or take issue with a parameter.  The technical team had a place to document their plans and changes through the revision control process where everyone else on the t echnical team could see the changes and use it as an authoritative source.  The clients could use the technical base line to communicate concerns desired changes, or insight into risk mitigation or changes 
 


 6 The users and other stakeholders were able to use the technical baseline to communi cate concerns or parameter changes they needed so the sy stem was interoperable with other systems.  In the end this was probably the single greatest benefit of the technical baseline documentation \226 an authoritative document providing all of the technical, risk and test parameters in one place to facilitate communication among all stakeholders Authoritative Source for Technical Data As mentioned previously, the importance of an authoritative source for technical data cannot be underestimated Unfortunately too often on IT projects, the IT parameters risk assessment and mitigations, and test strategies remain in the hands, heads, or hard drives of the technicians.  When these individuals come together to document and agree on the technical parameters for the system it helps everyone.  A common technical baseline provides the framework for this collaboration and documentation to take place.  It also allows the team and the clients to look at the technical information differently and translate the big picture into other consequences, mitigate risks, understand cost and schedule impacts, and plan for testing. Most importantly having a set baseline allows control of requirements and scope changes and a mechanism for comparison after project completion.  Rather than an ever changing and drifting IT system where victory would eventually be declared and the system operational, we now had a set baseline for decision making and project metrics.  When a change was considered it could be measured in relation to the requirements, impact, risk, cost and schedule and appropriate action could be taken and a revision to the baseline documented.  Changes that were deemed out of scope could be documented a nd prioritized for another phase of the project, allowing focus to resume on the critical path to completion Until we joined the team five months into the UMS implementation process there was no common source where the technical team could r ecord their information requirements and scope changes and associated impacts Once the framework was created for the technical baseline interviews were conducted to populate the data, and communication sessions were conducted to ensure everyone understood the document, it became useful. Knowing that the data was accurate and that the technical team was relying on the data to communi cate with each other, develop interoperable systems, and plan for future tests, the technical baseline became an authoritative source for UMS data for the team and the client Test Plan Once the project team had a complete set of technical parameters, a technical baseline document to use to communicate with clients, and an area where risks were identified, test became the next focus.  A solid test plan is critical to ensuring timely IT project implementation and acceptance.  A system that has not been properly tested can still be implemented but risk will undermine client confidence and implementation delays if issues surface later The technical baseline allowed the UMS team to articulate the UMS test plans, schedules, and requirements and communicate them to all users In addition the test team was also able to take into account potential risk areas where mitigation options should be identified and tested as alternatives.  The UMS program went from a \223test when it\222s done\224 plan to a detailed and incr emental test plan that was responsive to the client concerns as they were raised or as issues were uncovered The UMS technical baseline allowed the entire team and stakeholders to have an open book on the UMS technical parameters and implementation plan in a way that was more effective than the average project plan.  The simple technical tables of authoritative data generated discussion questions, and ultimately a bette r product.  The discussions generated improved communication with the client and helped to manage expectations for final delivery.  In the end all of the things that project managers think comes naturally on a project team were brought together in an effective and fact based way through the technical baseline to achieve solid results for the UMS program 6  P ROCESS I MPROVEMENT P ROJECT L ESSONS L EARNED  The JPL Acquisition Process Improvement program was even less technical than the JPL UMS implementation.  The basis for the process improvement is Lean Six Sigma and the intent is to improve processes in the Acquisition Division on non-engineering initiativ es at JPL.  Other than statistics from metrics or surveys there was little data resulting in anything resembling technical information on this project The advantage was being able to implement the technical baseline on this project from the start.  While much of the project was not technical, there was still a Project Charter for the overall Acquisition Process Improvement Lean Six Sigma Implementation, and a project plan that included a schedule, selected LSS projects, and the original project Statement of work.  From these supporting documents a technical baseline for the overall project that included technical parameters, operational concepts, risks, and tests was created.  Technical Parameters in this case were adjusted to be program objec tives and success metrics for the overall program.  Operational concepts were important to document in the case of the API LSS program as much of the programs success focused on change management during the implementation phase of the LSS initiative.  Risk is not often documented in the context of a LSS program Risks to the API LSS program were documented in the 
 


 7 technical baseline which has proven useful as a proactive management and communication tool for risk management Test is another unusual area for a LSS program to evaluate and baseline.  In this case test became protocol and metrics for stakeholder communication, change management, and limited tests for LSS implementations.  These adjustments from a traditional technical baseline to the API LSS technical baseline were usef ul for the project team communication and for revision tracking back to the baseline to measure program progress and success Given this project construct the technical baseline was documented in a MS Power Point document.  The document is shown in Figure 3 below  Figure 3: API LSS Project Technical Baseline Working with process improvement experts and Lean Six Sigma Black Belts, the projects are always well organized and often well communicated.  So how did the practices from a technical baseline help the project?  The technical baseline concepts were introduced to provide more detail to the project plan and help as a communication vehicle to API stakeholders Unlike a traditional project plan the technical baseline was a companion document that provided an additional level of detail with the project implementation plans, the critical success factors, metrics that would be measured, potential risks, and any early test cases for the process improvement and their results.  This information was available to all stakeholders and project leads which provided an authoritative source of measurable data that went beyond the project schedule.  This allowed the stakeholders to participate at a deeper level and provide comments at early and critical points in the proj ect lifecycle.  The technical baseline also became a communication vehicle for the project team to communicate progress, results and changes to their stakeholders which was important in light of the many mini-projects taking place concurrently on a LSS program.  This baseline allows for overall program tracking and adjustments rather than only focusing on individual initiatives which has become continuous source of lessons learned feedback to improve future projects under the API LSS project 7  C ONCLUSIONS  The technical baseline approach provided a team unfamiliar with large scale engineer ing projects with a common baseline for their projects.  For both UMS and API the participants gained a solid vehicle that improved communication, became an authoritative source for technical information, and allowed for risk mitigation and test planning R EFERENCES    2232004 NASA C o st Est i m at i ng Handbook \(C EH  www.ceh.nasa.gov  223NPR 7120.5 NASA Space Flight Program and Project  Management Requirements\224   M e m o randum  Owen E.

Discussion and Conclusions  This study examined factors influencing organization assimilation of information technology in the context of Korean local governments. Of particular interests was the influence of organizational culture and types of knowledge on assimilation. The result of this study can be summarized as follows First, centralization is negatively associated with assimilation of IT. It seems that structural perspective on organizational innovation has been upheld again by this study Second, rational organizational culture is positively associated with assimilation of IT.

result of actions by individuals and units within the organization. These actions of assimilation, in turn are stimulated or discouraged by an organizational milieu of norms, values, and rules. To the extent that assimilation of IT lies in the arena of rational choice of individuals, organizations may be able to foster assimilation by providing appropriate incentives Third, the quality of information resource management is positively associated with organizational assimilation of IT. The capacity of IT department in providing end-user support and enduser participation in IT project planning continue to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6   be important in promoting the organizational assimilation of IT   6.

managed. Although the provided methodology is flexible with respect to the level of detail, the decision to develop highly detailed RPBBs causes higher efforts for documenting processes. Further refinements of the methodology could address this issue by identifying typical sequences of components patterns basis of a semantic standardization of RPBBs using the comprehensive basis of 200 process models for the public sector. Consequently, such patterns will enable standardization of process fragments, too, and support a more efficient modeling \(cp. analogy-based construction [14 identification of typical process patterns is required Concluding previous discussions, the main strength of RPBB-based process documentation is the semantic standardization of models. This not only enables distributed modeling by heterogeneous user groups but also allows for the automation of analyses such as pattern-based mechanisms for plausibility and consistency check, performance measurement identification of organizational weaknesses and potentials for optimization \(organizational technology-driven, etc into other \(e.g. more technical or user-dependent notations and views [26]. However, automation approaches obviously require technical support Hence, a realization in form of a web-based prototype is currently progressing. On the one hand this prototype supports distributed process modeling with RPBBs implementing the idea of stepwise specialization via dynamic dialogues \(guided modeling semantic reasoning enables the pattern-based identification of organizational deficiencies weaknesses technologies The prototypical implementation allows for flexible modifications of existing RPBBs and for the extension with additional RPBBs and weakness pattern. It enables comprehensive testing and evaluation of the described approaches. Furthermore it supports the transfer of the developed methodologies to other domains and further associated adaptations and refinements. The underlying methodological foundation and the prototypical implementation thereby represent a rigorous as well as relevant contribution to the field of collaborative process modeling 6.
