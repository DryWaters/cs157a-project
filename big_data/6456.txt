The Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm in mining association rules. With the time a number of changes proposed in Apriori to enhance the performance in term of time and number of database passes. For the two bottlenecks of frequent item sets mining: the large multitude of candidate 2-itemsets, the poor efficiency of counting their support. This paper main focus lies in the generation of frequent patterns which is the most important task in explanation of the fundamentals of association rule mining. This is done by analyzing the implementations of the well known association rule mining algorithms Apriori and  Proposed algorithm Set operation for Frequent Item using Transaction database   Keywords  Association rule; Frequent Itemset Mining; date mining; KDD; Set operation I  INTRO DUCTION Data mining is the core of knowledge discovery in databases. It’s a procedure to find the useful and potentially knowledge in database. Association rules are one of the most important knowledge of data mining’s result which can be defined as the relation and dependency between the itemsets by given support and confidence in data The mining method of association rule in the transaction databases is suitable for analytical databases Finding  frequent item sets is one of the most investigated fields of data mining. The problem was first presented in [1 The  subsequent paper i s con s i d ered as o n e of t h e m o st important contributions to the subject. Its main algorithm APRIORI, not only influenced the association rule mining community, but it affected other data mining fields as well APRIORI is not only an appreciated member of the FIMI community and regarded as a baseline algorithm, but its variants to find frequent sequences of itemsets isod e s  12  Boo l ean for m u l a s   9   an d l a be le d grap h s [10, 1 1   hav e  proven to be efficient algorithms as well[3   Two new algorithms for Association Rule Mining Apriori and AprioriTid, along with a hybrid of the two algorithms, are described in the paper. The performance of these algorithms is shown to be from many times better for smaller datasets to many orders of magnitude better than the then current algorithms. The algorithms described in the paper represent a huge improvement over the state of the art in Association Rule Mining at the time. The new algorithms improve upon the existing algorithms by employing the following. Apriori and AprioriTid reduces the number of itemsets to be generated each pass by reducing the number of candidate itemsets   AprioriTid uses an encoding of the database for each pass instead of using the complete database This greatly reduces the overhead cost associated with making passes over the dataset especially in later passes   Apriori Hybrid combines the features of the two aforementioned algorithms. It employs the Apriori algorithm for mining for earlier passes but switches to AprioriTid when the size of the encoding is expected to fit into memory.[4   II  PROBLEM DECOMPOSITION AND PAPER ORGANIZATION The problem of discovering all association rules can be decomposed into two sub problems  1  Find all sets of items \(itemsets\that have transaction support above minimum support. The support for an itemset is the number of transactions that contain the itemset. Itemsets with minimum support are called large itemsets, and all others small itemsets. In section V we present experimental overview of modified Apriori 2  Use the large itemsets to generate the desired rules Here is a straightforward algorithm for this task. For every large itemset 1, find all non-empty subsets of 1 For every such subset a, output a rule of the form a 1 - a if the ratio of support l o support a is at least minconf .We need to consider all subsets of 1 to generate rules with multiple consequents. Due to lack of space, we do not discuss this sub problem further, but refer the reader to [10 f o r a f a st  algorithm In Section 3, we show the discovery of association rule in large database. We also describe the classical Apriori AprioriTid. We also describe how the Apriori and AprioriTid algorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm AprioriHybrid, in section 4. In section VI we show the relative performance of the proposed improved-Apriori algorithms against the Apriori [5  an d  Apri oriTi d [4 algorithms, which is a combination of Apriori algorithm and transaction space with frequent Itemset tree. We conclude by pointing out some related problems in Section VII  309 ___________________________________ 978-14244 8679-3  11 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE 


III  ASSOCIATION RULE MINING  The discovery of association rules in large databases was first described by Agrawal et al. \(1993\. The initial motivation for association rules was to aid in the analysis of large transaction databases, such as those collected by supermarkets. The discovery of associations between the purchases of various line items can potentially aid decision making within retail organizations. Transaction databases are therefore the primary domain targeted for association rule discovery. [4 The initial algorithm, AIS, proposed by Agrawal et al operates by looking for itemsets with the required support within the database, called large itemsets. Trying to find all of the large itemsets in a single pass over the data is inefficient because most of the itemsets that would be measured are not large. The AIS technique reduces this inefficiency by making several passes over the data and using the results of the current pass to produce candidate large itemsets to evaluate in the next pass. This process of discovering large itemsets continues until no more large itemsets are found. This approach however has proven to produce too many small itemsets as candidates for large itemsets. This is because it produces candidate itemsets by extending the existing large itemsets using itemsets that are not large. Mannila et al. \(1993, 1994\describe an algorithm that is faster than the Agrawal et algorithm, and has demonstrated a performance improvement of a factor of five in testing examples. The efficiency gain in their algorithm is based upon the observation that subsets of large sets must also be large. The number of candidate sets can therefore be dramatically reduced by using only large itemsets in the construction of other candidate large itemsets. They also point out the viability of sampling as an efficient method for finding large itemsets. However, as expected, sampling techniques result in a trade-off in accuracy. As a result of the same observation as Mannila et al, Agrawal and Srikant propose two alternative algorithms, Apriori and AprioriTid both of which are more efficient than AIS \(Agrawal and Srikant 1994\[5   Classical Apriori algorithm Cl = {candidate I-itemsets L1 = {c  C1 c.count  m insup FOR \(k=2 ; Lk-1 k++\BEGIN Ck=apriori-gen\(Lk-1 FOR all transactions t  D D O BEGIN Ct=subset \(Ck,t FOR all candidates c  Ct D O c.count END Lk={c  Ck c.count minsup END Answer L k   The association rule mining is a two-step process 1  Find all the frequent itemsets in the transaction database. If support of itemset X, support\(X minsup then X is a frequent itemset. Otherwise, X is not a frequent itemset 2  Generate strong association rules from frequent itemsets. For every frequent itemset A, if B  A  B   and support \(A\port \(B minconf, then we have association rule  B A-B step is relatively easy, and its algorithm generation can be found in the reference The present focuses in research are to find highly efficient algorithms in the first step[6  Ap r i o r i a nd AprioriTid generate itemsets by using only the large itemsets found in the previous pass, without considering the transactions. AprioriTid improves Apriori by only using the database at the first pass. Counting in subsequent passes is done using encodings created in the first pass, which is much smaller then the database. This leads to a dramatic performance improvement of three times faster than AIS and four times faster than SETM in one of their experiments in 4  AprioriTid algorithm L1={large 1-itemsets C1’=database D FOR \(k=2; Lk-1 != 0; i++ \O BEGIN Ck=apriori-gen\(Lk-1 Ck’=0 FORALL entries t in Ck-1’ DO BEGIN Ct={c in Ck | \(c-c[k  in t.set-of i t e m s ets   c c  k 1  i n  t.set-of-itemsets FOR ALL Candidates c in Ct DO c.count IF \(Ct != 0\ THEN Ck’ +=<t.TID,Ct END Lk={c in Ck | c.count >= minsup END Answer = Sum Lk  AprioriTid uses the database only once and use apriorigen to generate candidates. Database D is not used for counting support after the first pass. The set is Ck’used, for this purpose. Elements of Ck’are in the form <TID, {Xk where each Xk is a potentially large k-itemset present in the transaction with identifier TID. The member of Ck corresponding to transaction t is <t.TID, {c  Ck’ | c contained in t}> [4 7  IV  APRIORI-HYBRID ALGORITHM It is not necessary to use the same algorithm in all the passes over data. Figure 4.1 shows the execution times for Apriori and AprioriTid for different passes over the dataset T10.14.DlOOK. In the earlier passes, Apriori does better than AprioriTid. However, AprioriTid beats Apriori in later passes. We observed similar relative behaviour for the other 310 


datasets, the reason for which is as follows. Apriori and AprioriTid use the same candidate generation procedure and therefore count the same itemsets. In the later passes, the number of candidate itemsets reduces. However, Apriori still examines every transaction in the database. On the other hand, rather than scanning the database, AprioriTid scans Ck’ for obtaining support counts, and the size of Ck’ has become smaller than the size of the database. When the Ck sets can fit in memory, we do not even incur the cost of writing them to disk                 Figure 4.1: Per pass execution times of Apriori and AprioriTid T10.14.DlOOK, minsup = 0.75  Based o n these observations, we can design a hybrid algorithm, which we call AprioriHybrid, that uses Apriori in the initial passes and switches to AprioriTid when it expects that the set Ck’ at the end of the pass will fit in memory. We use the following heuristic to estimate if Ck’ would fit in memory in the next pass. At the end of the current pass, we have the counts of the candidates in Ck. From this, we estimate what the size of Ck’ would have been if it had been generated. This Size, in words, is candidates c  Ck  Support\(c\ + number of transactions\. If Ck’ in this pass was small enough to fit in memory, and there were fewer large candidates in the current pass than the previous pass, we switch to AprioriTid. The latter condition is added to avoid switching when Ck’ in the current pass fits in memory but Ck’ in the next pass may not   Switching from Apriori to AprioriTid does involve a cost. Assume that we decide to switch from Apriori to AprioriTid at the end of the kth pass. In the \(k + 1\th pass after finding the candidate itemsets contained in a transaction we will also have to add their IDS to Ck+1. Thus there is an extra cost incurred in this pass relative to just running Apriori. It is only in the \(k+2\th pass that we actually start running AprioriTid. Thus, if there are no large \(k + 1 itemsets, or no \(k+ 2\candidates, we will incur the cost of switching without getting any of the savings of using AprioriTi N o w, Fi g 4.2  sh ow t h e e x e c u t ion  t i m e s f o r  Apriori,AprioriTid and AprioriHybrid for different passes over the dataset T10.14    Figure 4.2 Per pass execution times of Apriori, AprioriTid and AprioriHybrid \(T10.14.DlOOK, minsup = 0.75   V  PROPOSE D ALGORITHM SFIT SET OPERATION FOR FREQUENT ITEM-SET USING TRANSACTION DATABASE  In this section we describe our new approach for frequent Itemset mining is described. This approach is a combination of Apriori algorithm and frequent Itemset lattice Our algorithm is a combination of Apriori, which is the most popular mining algorithm, and set operations Principles of set operations, which are intersection and union are used. These principles are related to frequent Itemset tree In frequent Itemset tree, there are nodes holding frequent itemsets and transactions containing related itemsets In order to construct k-itemsets, frequent \(k-1\-itemsets are used. Their union is formed and for their support count and intersection operation is employed between the Tids of the itemsets Itemset {A} is in transactions with Tid 1,3,4,5 and {B} is in transactions with Tid 1,2,3,4,5,6, i.e. T\(A\={1,3,4,5} and T\(B\={1,2,3,4,5,6}. The Itemset {A, B} is the union of these two itemsets and intersection principles is used to find the tids for {A, B} as follows  T\(AB\T\(A  T B\ ={1,3,4,5   1,2,3,4,5,6 1, 3, 4, 5 If the result is greater than minimum support, it will be joined to frequent Itemset tree. If the result is lower than minimum support, it will be pruned off  Now, steps of the proposed  Algorithm “Set Operation for  frequent Itemset using Transcation Database” SFIT   1  Scan database and find frequent 1-itemsets, at the same time obtain transaction sets, which includes the Itemset Assume that the frequent 1-itemsets and transaction 311 


sets, require no more memory that available and also there is space for generating candidate 2-itemsets from frequent 1-itemset 2  Generate candidate 2-itemsets from frequent 1-itemset only 3  Prune off the candidate 2-itemsets whose node count is lower than min support using their Tidset. Now frequent Itemset tree contains only frequent 2-itemsets at the second level 4  Consequently, for each frequent 3, 4… n–Itemset, scan the database to approve the consistence of the Itemset 5  Finally, Itemset are used to generate strong rules having minimum confidence in the frequent Itemset tree  This is an example based on the transaction database, D of Figure 5.1. There are four transactions in this database that is, |D|=4. We use the improved Apriori algorithm for finding frequent itemsets in D, based on the set operation Intersection  Below Fig shows the example implementation of Apriori and proposed Apriori SFIT   Fig 5 1 Example Implementation showing Apriori   Fig 5.2 Example implementation showing Proposed Apriori SFIT  VI   IMPLEMENTATION AND ANALYSIS  The target of this section is implementing Apriori and DIC. Our concerns include comparison of frequent item sets obtained, and factors that affect the efficiency of the algorithms  By this means, we intend to state the advantages of SFIT over Apriori  6.1  Environment and Database  The programming language we use to implement the algorithms is .NET C# 2008  6.2  Result analysis  For the experiment we have used datasets of different application.

Through pruning candidate itemsets by the infrequent itemsets, the present algorithm can reduce the number of database scanning and the redundancy while generating subtests and verifying them in the database Validated by the experiments, it can obtain better efficiency The presented new approach for mining frequent itemsets is a bottom-up level wise approach that utilizes both Item set space and transaction space 313

    Fig.3. Sample pairs within a patient case myalgia\ccurs before all the start dates of Enalapril, it does not form a pair with the drug. The ICD-9 code 786.2 \(cough occurs after the first start date of Enalapril in 24 days. Thus a pair is found, i.e., Enalapril \226 786.2. The code 276.7 Hyperkalemia\rs twice after the second start date of Enalapril. A pair is formed between the drug and the closest occurrence of 276.7  After a pair is found, its degree of association is assessed using the fuzzy RPD model. Four cues \(i.e., temporal association, other explanation, dechallenge, and rechallenge are utilized in this process. The temporal association of a pair is determined by the length of duration between drug start date and ADR occurrence date. We let Ta and L represent the temporal association and length of duration, respectively Then the following fuzzy rules are used to infer Ta       Both L and Ta are fuzzy variables, and their fuzzy values short, likely, etc.\ented by triangular membership functions. The universe course for L is set as 0 to 180 days That is, if the ADR occurs within 180 days after the drug start date, the pair is considered as having temporal association Dechallenge refers to the relationship between discontinuity of the drug and abatement of the ADR. We cannot directly evaluate the dechallenge of a pair since the drug stop date is usually unavailable in electronic health databases. However, we can indirectly assess the existence of dechallenge of a pair using the rule \223if the potential ADR occurs after the drug start date and another drug in the same class was prescribed after the potential ADR, then dechallenge is likely intended by the physician for the former drug\224. In medical practice, if an apparent adverse effect is found on a patient and is suspected to be caused by a drug, the physician often stops the drug and prescribes another drug in the same class to avoid the problem and still treat the original disease. Thus, it is very likely that there exists dechallenge between the original drug and the ADR in this situation Rechallenge depicts the relationship between re-introduction of the drug and recurrence of the ADR. That is, the same pair appears again after the drug is taken by the patient again. Rechallenge is defined as a fuzzy variable and its value is determined by the temporal associations of the two consecutive occurrences of the same pair. We let Ta1 and Ta2 represent the two temporal associations, respectively. Then the following fuzzy rules are used to assess the value of the rechallenge of a pair          The cue \223other explanations\224 denotes alternative explanations by concurrent disease or other drugs. Thus, it is drug- or disease-dependent. To make our algorithm as general as possible, this variable is not utilized at present. Note that the other three variables can be easily extended to other applications since they can characterize the causal relationship between two general events After the cue values of a pair are extracted from a case we use the procedure \(called feat ure matching\ introduced in Section III to transform the data of a pair to the format shown in Table II. We then compute the support and causal-leverage  for all the pairs, each of which implies a causal association rule. Instead of setting an explicit threshold for the causal-leverage measure, we rank all the causal association rules in the decreasing order of the measure and return the most interesting rules V  E XPERIMENTS  To evaluate the effectiveness of our new data mining strategy, we retrieved the electronic data of all patients who received at least one of the 8 drugs of our interest in the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit during the time period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2008. The interested drugs include 6 statin drugs \(i.e., rosuvastatin atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin\ and 2 ACEI \(angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\gs \(i.e., captopril and enalapril\Event\222 data such as dispensing of drug  office visits and certain  laboratory testing was retrieved for all the patients. For each event certain details were obtained. For example, the data for dispensing of drug includes name of the drug, subject ID quantity of the drug dispensed, dose of the drug, drug start date, drug schedule, and the number of refills  The total number of retrieved patients was 16,206. All the data were stored in a Mricrosoft Access database. The database has five tables, each of which contains one of the five types of information: demographic data, patient visit data, diagnostic data, drug-related data, and laboratory data JDBC  Java Database Connectivity\, an application programming interface for the Java programming language was used to access the database. It can wrap SQL \(Structured Query Language\ment, send it to the database, and retrieve the desired data. Fuzzy rules and fuzzy reasoning were implemented using the freeware FuzzyJess [19  a  Java-based fuzzy inference engine. It allows the user to use Java language to define membership functions, set antecedent and consequent of a fuzzy rule, and make a fuzzy inference This made it easier to integrate the reasoning process with the If L is short then Ta is likely  If L is medium then Ta is possible  If L is long then Ta is unlikely  If Ta1 is likely and Ta2 is likely then rechallenge is likely If Ta1 is likely and Ta2 is possible then rechallenge is likely  If Ta1 is likely and Ta2 is unlikely then rechallenge is possible  If Ta1 is possible and Ta2 is likely then rechallenge is likely  If Ta1 is possible and Ta2 is possible then rechallenge is possible If Ta1 is possible and Ta2 is unlikely then rechallenge is possible  If Ta1 is unlikely and Ta2 is likely then rechallenge is possible  If Ta1 is unlikely and Ta2 is possible then rechallenge is possible  If  T a1 is unlikel y and T a2 is unlikel y then rechallenge is unlikel y 


   other parts of the data mining algorithm which were also implemented in Java To test the proposed data mining algorithm, we select a drug that has high frequency in the database since ADRs occur infrequently. In general, if the occurrence rate of an ADR is greater than 1%, it can be detected in the pre-marketing clinical trials and the drug is not likely to be approved for marketing. Thus, the occurrence rate of an ADR is generally less than 1% in post-marketing surveillance Moreover, to generate a valid signal, the interestingness measure is often used together with another criteria \226 the count of drug-ADR pairs being greater than or equal to That is, even if the calculated interesting measure for a pair is higher than a threshold, the pair cannot be considered as a valid signal if there are only one or two patient cases containing the pair. This requires at least 300 \(3/0.01=300 cases in order to generate a valid signal. The real situation is even worse since the occurrence rate of most ADRs is much lower than 1%. Many more cases will be needed We finally picked the drug enalapril to test the proposed algorithm since 888 patients were found taking the drug at least once in the database and a number of its known ADRs had relative high occurrence rate Causal-leverage values were calculated for each of the pairs between enalapril and all the 3,953 distinctive ICD-9 codes found in the database. All the pairs were ranked in a d ecreasing order according to their causal-leverage values. A pair between the drug and one of its known ADRs, 276.7 \(hyperkalemia\was found to be ranked as 33 out of 3,953. That is, our data mining algorithm classified the pair into top 1% of all the pairs. Note that, in post-marketing surveillance, the primary purpose of using data mining is to shorten the long list of potential drug-ADR pairs. Like the other data mining methods, the signal pairs found by our approach will be subject to further analysis \(e.g epidemiology study\ and case review and interpretation by drug safety professionals experienced in the nuances of pharmacoepidemiology and clinical medicine  VI  C ONCLUSION  Causal association represents an important relationship between two events in many applications. Finding causal associations can help us prevent adverse effects caused by their antecedents. We have introduced a knowledge representation - CAR and have developed a new interestingness measure causal-leverage to quantify the degree of causality of a CAR. Based on this novel measure and an experience-based fuzzy RPD model, we have developed a data mining algorithm to search an electronic health database for ADR signals. Experimental results showed that our method could greatly shortlist the number of pairs between a given a drug and all its potential ADRs A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We would like to thank Ellison Floyd for retrieving the patient information from the VAMC Detroit\222s databases.

repository, a knowledge miner and a case based rule structure In the knowledge miner component, the decision tree technique is used to build trees from a database of cases. The decision tree technique is also used in the Case Based Reasoning Module to find possible solutions to a new child case [11 A decision tree starts with root attributes and ends with leaf nodes. Usually it has several branches which represent classes Below, we show an example of decision tree algorithm that was used for childhood obesity prediction [10 The tree is generated based on information-gain measure The steps are as follows.  Calculate  12  13  where pi is the probability that an arbitrary sample belongs to class C                   Figure 6.  Child weight management counseling system architecture [11      


Then, calculate the entropy E\(Ai based on partitioning by attribute Ai  as follows  14   15  where Pij = sij / | Sj |, and | Sj | is the number of samples in subset Sj. Then by branching on Ai, the encoding information that would be gained is  16 For the root node, the attribute Ai with the highest information gain is selected. Then the branches are built based on different values of aij, j = 1,,q. The tree will grow until all the samples are in same class, at which point the node becomes a leaf and is labeled with that class [10]. Fig.7 shows a graphical example of a decision tree for an obesity problem. S1, S2, and S3 in Fig. 7 refer to the solutions of the obesity problem IV. DISCUSSION In this section, we discuss the effectiveness, efficacy, strengths and weaknesses of the three data mining techniques. We also include the challenge within the problem and its applicability to other adult diseases. Table 1 summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of each technique discussed ANN, nave Bayes classifier, and decision tree are data mining techniques that are applicable for childhood obesity prediction. For ANN, environment is considered as an important factor for childhood obesity prediction. The prediction result can be more promising because environment undeniably plays major role in a childs growth. The nave Bayes classifier focuses more on the childs personal attributes rather than the environment. However, the result of nave Bayes classifier has been proven acceptable for childhood obesity prediction [10       


     Table I.  Data mining methods comparison Technique Strengths Weaknesses Artificial Neural Networks \(ANN  1. Can handle a large amount of input data   2. Fault tolerance and low energy consumption  1.  Efficiencies \(error vs network size problem dependent 2.   The run time speed may be slow when many problems are involved Nave Bayes 1. Accurate when sample attributes are independent 2. Simple and computationally efficient  1.  High bias 2.  Less accurate and performance degrades when attribute are dependent Decision Tree 1. Fast learning and classification speed 2.  Results in humanunderstandable rules  1.  Prone to error if there 


are many classes and a relatively small number of training examples 2.  Can be computationally expensive to train  For the decision tree, we see that the technique is easier to build than the other two methods since various attributes can be used for childhood obesity prediction In the future, we will work on hybridizing two or more applicable data mining methods. We hope that the results will be better than current methods available.  Our goal is to increase the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of predictions, and reduce the cost \(time and space methods. We will also increase our efforts to find better solutions to childhood obesity                 Figure 7. A decision tree for an obesity problem [11 The main challenge within this problem is to successfully predict obesity at an early age. As we know, it is difficult to identify potentially obese children when they are still young Their parent\(s become obese when they grow up. Many factors are related to obesity, including environment, family, lifestyle and habits Obesity may lead to many co-morbidity disorders such as type 


2 diabetes, cardiovascular, early puberty, suicide, smoking bulimia, poor self image, social isolation and hypertension [1 If obesity prediction is successful, then early prevention steps can be taken The data mining techniques outlined above have also been used to predict other adult diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases [12][13]. The similarities with childhood obesity prediction are the way data was collected and the risk factors, while the differences are the input and output of the prediction and how the techniques were implemented for that purpose V. CONCLUSION This survey has shown that data mining can be used to successfully predict childhood obesity. The three methods presented  ANN, nave Bayes, and decision tree  are proven applicable to childhood obesity prediction.  These methods each have their weaknesses and strengths; thus, further improvements of the techniques are necessary to fully resolve the childhood obesity prediction problem. This survey also reminds the reader about co-morbidity of childhood obesity and why it is important to prevent it at early age ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia \(USM REFERENCES  1] A.

follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
