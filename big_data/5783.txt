CAPRE A New Methodology for Product Recommendation Based on Customer Actionability and Pro\002tability Thomas Piton Julien Blanchard and Fabrice Guillet KnOwledge  Decision Team LINA UMR CNRS 6241 Computer Science Laboratory of Nantes-A tlantique Polytechnic School of Nantes University France f thomas.piton julien.blanchard fabrice.guillet g univ-nantes.fr Abstract Recommender systems can apply knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making product recommendations This aims to establish a customer loyalty strategy and thus to optimize the customer life time value In this paper we propose CAPRE a data-mining based 
methodology for recommender systems based on the analysis of turnover for customers of speci\002c products Contrary to classical recommender systems CAPRE does not aspire to predict a customer's behavior but to in\003uence that behavior  By measuring the actionability and pro\002tability of customers  we have the ability to focus on customers that can afford to spen d larger sums of money in the target business CAPRE aggregate s rules to extract characteristic purchasing behaviors and then analyzes the counter-examples to detect the most actionabl e and pro\002table customers We measure the effectiveness of CAPRE by performing a cross-validation on the 
MovieLens benchmark The methodology is applied to over 10,000 individual customers and 100,000 products for the customer relationship management of VM Mat´eriaux company thus assisting the salespersons objective to increase the customer value Keywords customer data mining data mining for marketing recommender system actionable knowledge discovery indu strial case-based application I I NTRODUCTION In a world where the number of product and service offers can be overwhelming Recommender Systems RS help customers 002nd and evaluate products or services RS are software tools and techniques providing suggestions fo 
r products to be use by a customer 1  2   T h e y c o n n e c t customers with potential products to purchase by associating either the content of products or the opinions of customers or both In recent years RS have found numerous applications in industry especially in e-commerce They help to develop and maintain pro\002table relationships with customers 3  f o r e x a m p l e t h r o u g h c r o s s o r u p s e l l i n g  With most RS the recommendations depend on the products that are currently bought by the customer 4  T h i s principle is perfectly appropriate to e-commerce websites  where the customer is alone for driving the product exploration However it is hardly adaptable to salespersons vi 
sits to customers We propose to adopt a different strategy when salespersons visit customers which product\(s can they recommend to trigger purchasing Contrary to classical RS our goal is not to predict customer behaviors but to in\003uence customer behaviors Making such recommendations requires i to identify characteristic purchasing behaviors and  ii to apply them on customers while respecting their own behaviors This last point is crucial because the cost of an inappropriate recommendation is higher in the case of salespersons visits than on e-commerce websites 5  T h e salespeople may even refuse to use the RS if they consider 
the recommendations not suf\002ciently relevant 6  In this paper we propose CAPRE  Customer Actionability and Pro\002tability Recommendation  a new methodology for recommender systems based on the analysis of turnover for customers of speci\002c products More precisely CAPRE aggregates rules to extract characteristic purchasing beh aviors and then analyzes the counter-examples to detect the most actionable and pro\002table customers Recommendations are made by targeting the actionable counter-examples with the most pro\002table rules Actually we do not use rules as naive implications of purchasing behaviors We use the 
rules as a model to detect counter-examples i.e customers with deviant purchasing behaviors that have the potential to spend larger sums of money in the target business Our methodology is applied over 10,000 customers and 100,000 products for the customer relationship management of VM Mat  eriaux  A Contributions of the Paper The main contributions of this paper can be resumed as follows 017 We develop a new methodology for recommending products from a turnover database 017 We propose a measure of actionability of the recommendations based on the similarity between the 
examples and counter-examples 017 We offer an original measure of the pro\002tability of the recommendations based on criteria de\002ned by experts 017 We apply CAPRE on an actual VM Mat  eriaux trading group database composed of more than 10,000 customers and 100,000 products 017 We measure the effectiveness of our system on the MovieLens benchmark with a cross-validation

B Organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows section II presents a state of the art in the recommender systems and rule mining 002elds Then section III discusses our methodology CAPRE with the two measures of actionability and pro\002tability We apply CAPRE in order to make recommendations on an actual dataset of VM Mat 264 eriaux trading group 1 in section IV We analyze the effectiveness of CAPRE in section V by performing a cross-validation on the MovieLens benchmark The 002nal section concludes and describes our future work II R ELATED W ORK The growth of Internet and the emergence of e-commerce has led the development of RS 7  T h e s e a l l o w c o m p a n i e s to 002lter information and recommend products to customers according to their preferences Recommend products and services can enhance the relationship between customer and seller and thus increase pro\002ts 8  A c t u a l l y r e c o m m e n d a tion is not a new concept it is already used on the Web through movies books and music RS have become an important research area since the appearance of the 002rst papers on collaborative 002ltering 7  R S a r e d o u b l y u s e f u l  on one hand they help customers 002lter through enormous numbers of products and focus on the few ones that match their preferences on the other hand recommender systems help companies increase their sales on the long tail Many techniques have been developed and several classi\002cations have been proposed 2  M o n t a n e r e t a l   9  provide a taxonomy and classify existing RS applications to speci\002c application domains entertainment movies music and IPTV content personalized newspapers Web pages elearning applications and e-mail 002lters e-commerce products to purchase such as books cameras PCs etc and services travel services experts for consultation houses to rent matchmaking services Examples of such applications include recommending books at Amazon.com movies by MovieLens or music by Yahoo Music Schafer et al 10 present a detailed classi\002cation of recommender systems in e-commerce and elucidate how they can be used to provide personalized service customer loyalty RS are usually classi\002ed into the following categories 017 Content-based recommendations  the customer will be recommended products similar to the ones the customers preferred in the past 017 Collaborative recommendations  the customer will be recommended products that customers with similar preferences and behaviors liked in the past 017 Hybrid approaches  this approach combine collaborative and content-based methods In the following subsections we will focus on collaborative 002ltering and rule mining for RS 1 http://www.vm-materiaux.com A Recommender Systems Based on Collaborative Filtering Collaborative recommender systems 7 p r o d u c e c u s t o m e r speci\002c recommendations of products based on patterns of ratings or purchases without need for exogenous information about either products or customers In other words the main idea is to exploit information about the past behavior of an existing customer for predicting which products the current customer will most probably like or be interested in These types of systems are in widespread industrial use today in particular as a tool in online retail sites There have been many collaborative systems developed in the academia and the industry It can be argued that the Grundy system 11 w a s t h e 002 r s t r e c o m m e n d e r s y s t e m  which proposed using stereotypes as a mechanism for building models Later on the Tapestry system relied on each customer to identify like-minded customers manually 12  GroupLens Video Recommender and Ringo use collaborative 002ltering algorithms to automate prediction In the recommendation 002eld the dif\002culty to collect descriptions customers and content is a recurrent problem B Rule Mining for Recommender Systems In the context of RS a transaction could be viewed as the set of all the previous ratings or purchases of a customer Association rules can be used to develop TopN recommendations for each customer depending on past purchases Frequently products are sorted by the con\002dence of the rules 13  u s i n g m u l t i l e v e l r u l e s  1 4  o r d e p e n d i n g on the antecedent length of rules 15  Recently rule mining has become a current application of RS Leung et al 16 p r e s e n t a m o d e l b a s e d o n f u z z y rules by exploiting similarities in product taxonomies Liu et al 17 p r o p o s e t o e x t r a c t c u s t o m e r p u r c h a s i n g b e h a v i o r s using sequential rules Finally Smyth et al 18 p r e s e n t t w o different case studies using association rules for RS III CAPRE M ETHODOLOGY In this section we propose CAPRE a new methodology to apply rules to recommendation systems A real-world application is presented in section IV CAPRE is divided into 002ve steps see 002gure 1 Figure 1 The Five Key Steps of CAPRE

A Purchasing Behavior Rule Mining 1 Data Let C be the set of all customers f c 1  c 2     c n g and P be the set of all products f p 1  p 2     p m g that can be recommended Let u be a utility function that measures the usefulness of product p for customer c  032 u  P 002 C  R p c  u  p c  1 where R is a part of R  e.g positive integers or numbers In our methodology u concerns a target business and has a 002nancial meaning For instance it can be the turnover of product p for customer c  The greater u  p c   the more the purchase of p by c is pro\002table for the company The function u depends on customer transaction history and can be materialized by a matrix customers 002 products This context is directly applicable in the usual framework of rating datasets see section V Then we apply two transformations see 002gure 2 on the values of the utility function to make the customers commensurable and to extract rule behaviors on discretized data u  p c  u   p c  u 003  p c  Utility fonction Normalization Discretization Figure 2 Normalization and discretization of the utility f unction 017 The 002rst step is to make the turnover of a customer c comparable with another regardless of their 002nancial potential For each customer c  the sales are transformed as a percentage of sales representing the usefulness ratio of a product p to a customer c  032 u   P 002 C  0 100  p c  u   p c  2 with u   p c   u  p;c  P p 2 P u  p;c  017 The second step is to normalize the proportions u   p c   that we denote u 003  p c   by taking into account their distribution for each product This normalization results in a discretization of proportions in several intervals 026 1  026 2      026 t  032 u 003  P 002 C  U  f 026 1  026 2     026 t g p c  u 003  p c  3 The normalization and discretization depend on the application Each customer c 2 C is described by various characteristic variables numerical or categorical suc h as age income etc For example  the utility function u is the turnover of customers for product families such as plaster concrete etc u 003  p c   026 1 respectively 026 2 and 026 3  means that the turnover of customer c for product p is low respectively medium and large Each building contractor customer c is described by characteristic variables composed of the number of employees the professional category etc 2 Mining Cohorts of Rules step 1 on 002gure 1 We apply an association rule mining algorithm 19 t o e x t r a c t purchasing behavior rules of the form u 003  p X  005   026 X  u 003  p Y  005   026 Y      u 003  p Z  005   026 Z 4 where 8 i p i 2 P and 8 j 026 j 2 U  The examples of the rule are the customers who satisfy the antecedent and the consequent corresponding to the dots  005  in 4 By contrast counter-example customers satisfy the antecedent a nd not the consequent 2  Such a rule means that the customers who satisfy the antecedent tend to satisfy the consequent I n our methodology as our goal is to make recommendations we use rules with only one product in the consequent For simplicity we will denote u 003  p X  c   026 X by p X  026 X where p X 2 P and 026 X 2 U  So we denote the rules in 4 as follows p X  026 X  p Y  026 Y     p Z  026 Z 5 In the classical association rule terminology p X  026 X is called an item The set of rules is 002ltered by support and con\002dence thresholds The resulting ruleset is denoted R  Given an item p X  026 X  a cohort is the set of all the rules in R concluding on this item Ct  p X  026 X   f r 2 R j consequent  r    p X  026 X  g 6 R is partitioned into as many cohorts as consequents of rules For the cohorts to be robust we retain only the cohorts with a suf\002cient number of rules The sets of examples and counter-examples of the cohort noted Ct   p X  026 X  and Ct 000  p X  026 X  are the union of the sets of examples and counter-examples of the rules respectively Detecting counter-examples provides us with a precise group of customers who can theoretically allow the company to run at a healthy pro\002t The interest of the cohorts is to merge all the rules which provide the same recommendation By exploiting rule redundancy we are able to extract more robust purchasing behavior models with more examples Given a cohort Ct  a Ct-Recommendation is to propose the consequent of Ct to a counter-example For example  let us consider the cohort Ct  Gravel  c  composed of two rules 017 Cement  c AND Sand  c  Gravel  c has 190 examples and 70 counter-examples 017 Sand  c AND Concrete Mixer  c  Gravel  c has 135 examples and 40 counter-examples The Ct-recommendation consists in proposing some gravel to customers who are counter-examples of at least one of the rules 2 In CAPRE the eligible counter-examples are only the custom ers who purchase p Z at a level lower than 026 Z

B Actionability of Counter-Examples Let us now consider a cohort With their partially unexploited purchase potential the counter-examples can theo retically help the company to develop its turnover However all the counter-examples cannot be equally receptive to our recommendations This is why our methodology focuses on the most actionable counter-examples i.e the counterexamples that are similar to examples according to the customer characteristic variables age gender income e tc The more a counter-example is similar to the examples the more it is likely to behave like an example i.e to purchase more of the consequent of the cohort 1 Pre-actionability on Purchasing Variables step 2 on 002gure 1 To be close to the examples Ct  of a cohort a counter-example e 000 should not display an extreme purchasing behavior on the antecedents of the rules of the cohort Ct  Given the purchases of example distribution on the antecedents of the cohort we de\002ne the median M and  Q 3 000 Q 1  the interquartile range of the distribution A counter-example e 000 2 Ct 000 is pre-actionable if and only if M 000  Q 3 000 Q 1  024 X p 2 antecedents of the cohort Ct u   p e 000  024 M   Q 3 000 Q 1  7 For example  given the cohort Ct  Gravel  c   the purchases of examples on the antecedents of the cohort are characterized by M  40  and Q 3 000 Q 1  20   To be pre-actionable a counter-example e 000 2 Ct 000 must have spent between 20  and 60  of its turnover on cement sand and concrete mixer 2 Actionability on Characteristic Variables step 3 on 002gure 1 In the multidimensional space of the customer characteristics we need a distance measure to assess similarities between customers As customer characteristics a re numerical and categorical variables we consider the frame work of Factor Analysis of Mixed Data FAMD introduced by Esco\002er in 1979 see 20 a n d  2 1  f o r f u r t h e r d e t a i l s   This framework provides the distance measure for mixed data that we use in CAPRE The customer characteristics consist of numerical and categorical variables 017 Let N be the set of centered and reduced numerical variables 017 By applying a complete disjunctive coding on categorical variables we generate a set I of indicators 3 a binary variable by modality The FAMD distance between customers c 1 and c 2 is de\002ned by d 2  c 1  c 2   v X i 1  N i;c 1 000 N i;c 2  2  w X j 1  I j;c 1 000 I j;c 2  2 8 3 The values of these indicators are divided by the square root of frequency of each indicator For example  roofers and tilers purchase many common products They can be close by their purchases see section III-B1 but remote by their characteristic variables For the rule Cement Bag  Tile  most examples are tilers However roofers tend to regularly purchase 25kg bags of cement to sink a fork or install a ridge roof Even if the counter-examples are tilers and roofers you have to recommend purchasing tiles only to tilers Computing actionability allows to avoid recommend purchasing tiles t o roofers To sum-up a counter-example e 000 is actionable if it is close enough to the examples Given two thresholds minDist and 016  e 000 is considered as 016 actionable for a cohort Ct if and only if 1 e 000 is pre-actionable see section III-B1 2 e 000 respects the following inequality 014 014 f e  2 Ct  j d  e 000  e   6 minDist g 014 014 014 014 Ct  014 014  016 9 with minDist a threshold de\002ning a neighborhood around the counter-example e 000  and 016 a threshold de\002ning a minimum ratio of neighbor examples to be actionable Given the distribution of the examples in the space of customer characteristics the distance from a counterexample to the barycenter of the examples is not necessarily representative That is why we do not use the barycenter in our measure C Pro\002tability of the Cohorts step 4 on 002gure 1 The pro\002tability of a counter-example corresponds to the value in Dollars of the Ct-Recommendation For example for each actionable counter-example see section III-B w e compute the total turnover in Dollars that should have been spent if the counter-example had behaved as an example of the cohort We denote by u  005  c  the sum P p 2 P u  p c   Given a threshold 022 2 R   a counter-example e 000 is de\002ned as 022 pro\002table for the product p Z  i.e for the recommendation Ct  p Z  if and only if P rof it  Ct  p Z   e 000    u  005  e 000  003 013  000 u  p Z  e 000   022 with the mean purchase ratio 013  P c 2 Ct  u  p Z  c  P c 2 Ct  u  005  c  10 Therefore the pro\002tability of a cohort of rules correspond s to the sum of the pro\002tabilities of the 022 pro\002table counterexamples of the cohort From this value we deduce 002xed and variable costs incurred by a business approach Moreover w e suggest using a scoring to re\002ne the pro\002tability expected for each customer The learning phase is guided by the examples of the cohort and the application phase by the pro\002table counter-examples

D Triggering the Most Actionable and Pro\002table Cohorts step 5 on 002gure 1 1 Marketing Recommendation Campaigns Several scenarios exist for decision makers to pro\002tably action the recommender system 017 Sorting cohorts in order to identify the most pro\002table Ct-Recommendations Therefore commercial actions can be triggered to promote products 017 For each customer sorting the cohorts in which the customer is a 022 pro\002table counter-example Salespersons can trigger to one or more recommendations creating a personalized relationship with the target customer 2 Return On Investment The methodology presented above allows us to propose an equation to calculate the expected ROI before triggering the most actionable and prof itable cohorts assuming that for each 022 pro\002table counterexample e 000  the pro\002tability P rof it  Ct  p   e 000  is computed for the most pro\002table cohorts ROI  X c 2 C p 2 P P rof it  Ct  p   c  000  with   013  014 000 015 11 017 013  operation 002xed costs salespersons visits communication gifts meals advertising etc 017 014  data mining costs time for preprocessing modeling and reporting 017 015  cost reduction due to time spent gain in the marketing department to establish recommendations IV A PPLICATION ON R EAL D ATA A Context The VM Mat  eriaux trading group offers more than 100,000 product references for professional building contractors whose have different characteristic variables an d often atypical purchasing behaviors Therefore the use of our methodology is appropriate to pro\002tably recommend products for target customers creating a personalized rel ationship and assisting the salespersons objective to incr ease the customer value B Purchasing Behavior Rule Mining 1 Data To address the problem of over-specialization  we use the product taxonomy of VM Mat  eriaux  The advantage of this approach is to obtain relevant rules in which the most common products do not hide the less common products by their frequency For example the rarest products such as photovoltaic panels will be codi\002ed in a more general level while the most common products such as plaster boards will be codi\002ed at a 002ner level We decided to collect data from our datawarehouse composed of approximately 91 tera-bytes and 180 tables 9,575 customer s having achieved a turnover threshold de\002ned by decision makers are selected and described through variables divid ed into three groups 017 20 internal variables in the datawarehouse address loyalty main salesperson authorized outstanding etc 017 9 external variables obtained from a Coface 4 002le number of employees professional category etc 017 414 aggregates computed from levels of the taxonomy sum of turnover for each product family cement insulation etc within the year before a datetime This data preprocessing produces a model with 9,575 observations and 443 variables In agreement with business requirements the purchases are made commensurable and are discretized see section III-A1 into three intervals a  b and c of the same frequency 1 3  to segment the small medium and large customer purchases respectively 2 Mining Cohorts of Rules The extraction of association rules is performed using the algorithm CHARM based on indepth research of closed itemsets 22 w i t h s u p p o r t t h r e s h o ld of 0.005 i.e about 50 customers and a con\002dence threshold of 75  A set of 7,788 rules is extracted see table I and partitioned into 57 cohorts of rules Table I S OME R ULES E XTRACTED BY THE CHARM A LGORITHM Sup Conf Rules 0.006 78.13 Plaster  b  Metal  c  Plaster Board  c 0.008 78.22 Tile  a  Parpen  c  Cement  c 0.011 76.81 Adhesive Coating  c  Plaster  c To illustrate CAPRE we focus on the cohort to recommend the purchase of plaster Ct  Plaster  c   The cohort is composed of 12 rules 150 distinct examples and 50 distinct counter-examples C Actionability of Counter-Examples To select the actionable counter-examples of Ct  Plaster  c   we compute the parameter minDist  28  43 which is the average distance between all customers see section III-B2 and we de\002ne with the commercial direction trading director purchasing direc tor and sales force team the threshold 016  10   Therefore a counter-example will be actionable if and only if 017 It is pre-actionable i.e its purchasing behavior for the antecedents of the rules of the cohort are in the interquartile range de\002ned in section III-B1 017 It has 10  of the examples Ct  of the cohort in its neighborhood at a maximal distance of 28  43  To apply these two steps let us visualize on 002gure 3 the distributions of examples Ct  and counter-examples Ct 000 on purchases from the antecedents of the cohort Antecedent purchases of Ct  are characterized by a median M  37  32  and an interquartile range Q 3 000 Q 1  28  05   Therefore the counter-examples outside the interval 9  27  65  37  are considered non pre-actionable  This 002ltering allows to prune 4 counter-examples 4 http://www.coface.com

We are currently using CAPRE in a real business application The goal is to use extensively CAPRE for any databases of the type customers 002 products This article offers the prospect for further work First the measure of pro\002tabili ty can be improved the actionability of cohorts could be modulated by the number of actionable counter-examples and the net margin of recommended products Secondly an application of recommendations can be integrated in the corporate information system for decision makers Finally  an OLAP-based approach can be adapted to address decision makers by trying to provide aggregated recommendations e.g for brands or product families to certain segments of customers A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Pierrick Richard and Ga¨etan Blain  VM Mat

Memory Requirements Evaluation For evaluating the memory requirements of three algorithms, the experiments focus on two aspects 1 We verify the memory requirements of tree construction among three algorithms with different minimum supports in T10I4D100K database. The result is shown in Fig. 11 As shown in Fig. 11, the results are not influenced by different minimum supports because theses algorithms are minimum support value independent. Nevertheless, for constructing T10I4D100K data set, CATS tree spent 15,654KB 


GC tree spent 19,881KB, and SC tree only spent 13,030KB SC tree algorithm saves about 17% and 34% than CATS tree and GC tree Then, we evaluate the influences of different transaction sizes with a fixed minimum support 0.4%. As shown in Fig. 12 we can find that the average constructing space for SC tree saves about 16% and 34% than CATS tree and GC tree 2 In this part, we focus on memory requirements of mining process. Three algorithms will be verified with different minimum support under 500K transactions and different transaction sizes under fixed minimum support 0.2%.

CONCLUSION AND FURTURE WORKS In this paper, a new tree structure called SC tree and a mining algorithm for association rule are proposed. Advantages of several algorithms are combined in this algorithm, and experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm outperforms CATS tree and GC tree mining algorithms For the SC tree algorithm, the mining model \(tree structure does not need to be re-constructed while the minimum support is changed. This property enables users to adjust the minimum support dynamically to find out satisfied large itemsets Because the database is sorted before mining, the SC tree can be mined only from the bottom-up direction, which is quite different from the bi-directional mining in CATS tree and thus the mining time for SC tree is shorter than CATS tree Moreover, the arrangement of sorted transactions is consistent so it is unnecessary for SC tree to adjust the tree structure as in CATS tree. That further improves the efficiency of tree construction in SC tree In addition, the memory requirements for constructing and mining the tree structure of SC tree are also less than both the CATS tree algorithm and the GC tree algorithm. Experimental results show that SC tree algorithm saves 16%~ 34% of memory space Although SC tree algorithm is more efficient than the other approaches, there are still some aspects can be considered for further improvement. One is the process of pre-sorting. When 


the data set is updated, the whole database has to be re-sorted If only partial tree structure rather than the whole tree structure is to be adjusted, execution time can be reduced substantially Another aspect is the scalability. When applying the SC tree algorithm in a large database, employing the technique of parallel and distributed computing can not only lightens the loading of processers and the requirement memory space but also suits for the architecture of disturbed computing environment in enterprises REFFERENCE 1] Peng, Y., Kou, G., Shi, Y., and Chen, Z., A Descriptive Framework for the Field of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery , International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, Vol. 7, Issue: 4, Page 639 - 682, 2008 2] R.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
