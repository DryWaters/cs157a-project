Secure Two and Multi-party Association Rule Mining Saeed Samet and Ali Miri Abstract Association rule mining provides useful knowledge from raw data in different applications such as health insurance marketing and business systems However many real world applications are distributed among two or more parties each of which wants to keep its sensitive information private while they collaboratively gaining some knowledge from their data Therefore secure and distributed solutions are needed that do not have a central or third party accessing the parties original data In this paper we present a new protocol for privacy-preserving association rule mining to overcome the security aws in existing solutions with better performance when data is vertically partitioned among two or more parties Two sub-protocols for secure binary dot product and cardinality of set intersection for binary vectors are also designed which are used in the main protocols as building blocks Index Terms Data mining Association rules Mining methods and algorithms Security and privacy protection Distributed data structures I I NTRODUCTION Privacy-preserving data mining is an emerging challenge in computer science because of the importance of security and privacy of individuals when data is distributed among two or more parties each of which is not willing and is often prohibited to reveal its private and sensitive information to the others Therefore standard algorithms for data mining have to be replaced with secure protocols Many secure protocols have been proposed so far for data mining and machine learning techniques such as 3 19 16 10 for decision tree classiìcation 23 in Na  ve Bayesian Classiìcation 15 6 12 for clustering 4 13 11 for Neural Networks and for Bayesian Netw orks One of the other popular and useful techniques in data mining is the association rule mining in which associations and/or correlations among items in a large dataset are discovered This technique has a wide variety of applications such as in health and medical research business and marketing homeland security etc There are some privacy-preserving protocols for this technique proposed by 17 22 In this paper we introduce new protocols for privacy-preserving association rule mining when data is heterogeneously distributed among two or more parties We also provide a review of existing work highlighting some of their potential security problems and a comparison to our proposed protocols In Section II  the association rule is brieîy reviewed In Section III  we rst explain why we need two building blocks Secure Binary Dot Product and Cardinality of Set Intersection and then we present our sub-protocols and main protocols for a privacy-preserving association rule Correctness complexity Saeed Samet and Ali Miri are with the School of Information Technology and Engineering SITE University of Ottawa Ottawa Canada email  saeed.samet,ali.miri  uottawa.ca and security analysis are also discussed in this section In Section IV  experimental results and comparisons with previous work are shown Section V is dedicated to related work and some of its potential security problems Finally conclusions and future work are described in Section VI  II A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING Association rule mining has been widely used since its introduction by Agrawal and Imielinski to help disco v e r patterns and associations in datasets A short deìnition of this technique follows Suppose X and Y are two sets of items Given a database S of tuples a tuple t will satisfy rule X  Y if t contains X and also contains Y  The percentage of tuples satisfying X and Y to the set of all possible tuples is called the Support of X  Y  and the ratio of the support of X  Y to the support of X is called the conìdence of X  Y  Thus formally we have Support X  Y   S Count X,Y   S  Conìdence X  Y  Support X  Y Support X Normally there are two support and conìdence thresholds in every application to which support and conìdence of rules are compared The association rule is usually applied on binary data and non-binary data can be easily converted to binary data using discretization The major steps of the standard algorithm for the association rule is shown in algorithm 1 Function apriori-gen generates the set of Algorithm 1 Association Rule Mining Procedure 1 L 1   large 1-itemsets  2 for k=2 L k  1     k do 3 C k  apriori-gen  L k  1  4 for all candidates c  C k do 5 Compute c.count 6 end for 7 L k   c  Ck  c.count  min.support  8 end for 9 return L   k L k candidate itemsets C k using its argument L k  1  Details are discussed in 2 III N EW P ROTOCOLS FOR P RIVACY P RESERVING A SSOCIATION R ULE M INING In this section we introduce two new and secure protocols for Secure Binary Dot Product SBDP and Cardinality of Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Security and Defense Applications \(CISDA 2009  2009 Crown Copyright 


TABLE I R AW BINARY DATA OF THREE VECTORS V 1  V 2 AND V 3   V 1 V 2 V 3 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 Set Intersection CSI when we are dealing with two and more than two parties respectively However we rst explain why we need these sub-protocols for vertically partitioned data As we saw in the procedure for computing the support and conìdence of each rule because each attribute belongs to one party values of each attribute can be considered as a vector Now suppose P 1 and P 2 have binary vectors V 1 and V 2 respectively If they want to compute the number of rows that have value 1 in both vectors they have to run a SBDP together In the same way with three or more parties CSI must be jointly computed To illustrate the concept letês consider the values in Table I as an example In this table we can see that  3  V i i 1  2  Here set intersection means the set of row numbers that have value 1 in all vectors In these protocols we assume that parties are semi-honest i.e they follow the protocols but may keep intermediate information to infer others data A Secure Binary Dot Product SBDP Suppose P 1 and P 2 each of which has a binary vector V 1 and V 2  respectively want to jointly and securely compute the dot product of their vectors They will perform the following steps 1 P 1 converts its vector V 1  to the summation of two non-binary vectors U 11 and U 12  2 P 2 does the same and constructs two non-binary vectors U 21 and U 22 from V 2  V 1  U 11  U 12 V 2  U 21  U 22 3 Now the scalar product of the binary vectors V 1 and V 2 is transformed to four scalar product of non-binary vectors V 1  V 2  U 11  U 21   U 11  U 22   U 12  U 21   U 12  U 22  Each dot product can be securely computed using a Secure Dot Product SDP protocol One of the best techniques for security and efìciency is presented by Goethals et al  Suppose X  x 1 x 2   x N  and Y  y 1 y 2   y N   P 1 creates a pair of public and private keys using a homomorphic encryption such as Pallier and sends the public k e y t o P 2  P 1 sends C i  e  x i  1  i  N  to P 2  P 2 computes W  N  i 1 C y i i  generates its private share S 2 and sends W   W  e   S 2  to P 1  P 1 computes its private share S 1  d  W    X  Y   S 2  This procedure is applied for all SDPs between P 1 and P 2  4 Now each party has four private shares such that the summation of these numbers is the dot product of V 1 and V 2  Note that if we apply the SDP protocol directly on binary vectors such as in pri v a c y of the parties is no longer preserved P 2 has the public key and therefore by encrypting 1 and comparing it with the received encrypted items from P 1  P 2 is able to reveal the private vector of P 1  B Cardinality of Set Intersection CSI among three or more parties When we are dealing with more than two parties SBDP is not applicable and to nd the support or conìdence of a rule we have to compute the CSI of the vectors involved However we cannot simply apply secure protocols for this problem on binary vectors because of security aws discussed before We now present a new and secure protocol for computing the CSI for more than two parties with binary vectors Suppose P 1   P n   n  3  each of which has a binary vector want to jointly and securely compute CSI of their vectors This means they have to count the number of the rows whose values in all vectors are 1 They will take the following steps 1 P 1  by using a random number generator converts its vector V 1  to the summation of n vectors such that V 1  V 1  1  V 1  2    V 1 n 1 2 P 1 generates public and private keys  e d  for an additive homomorphic encryption and publishes the public key e  to the other parties 3 P 1 encrypts V 1  2 V 1  3   V 1 n using the public key and sends e  V 1 i  to P i  2  i  n  4 P 2 computes e  V 2  and sends V  2  e  V 2   e  V 1  2  to P 3  5 P i  3  i  n  1  computes e  V i  and sends V  i  e  V i   e  V 1 i   V  i  1 to P i 1  6 P n generates a random vector U n  encrypts this vector e  U n   computes V  n  e  V n   e  V 1 n   V  n  1  e  U n  and sends it to P 1  7 P 1 decrypts V  n  and sets U 1  V 1  1  d  V  n   8 P 1 and P n jointly generate a random permutation   and create U  1    U 1  and U  n    U n  respectively Then they divide these vectors to n  2 parts and send parts U  1 k and U  n,k  2  k  n  1 to the corresponding party  P 2   P n  1   9 Each party P k  2  k  n  1  computes U  1 k  U  n,k  and counts the rows with the value n  The summation of these counters is the nal result for the CSI of the n parties Note that this protocol can be also applied to two parties if we have a trusted third party to receive the nal permuted vectors and compute the counts To make the protocol more clear we give a small example Suppose the number of parties is

focus on privacypreserving association rule mining using the second approach i.e Secure Multi-party Computation when data is vertically partitioned among two or more parties Vaidya and Clifton proposed a protocol for pri v a c y preserving association rule mining when data is vertically partitioned between two parties By considering boolean data they use a secure dot product SDP to compute the support and conìdence of each rule They use an algebraic solution for SDP by placing values in equations which are masked with random values However as indicated in their paper it has security problems with boolean values Vaidya and Clifton also present a protocol for the CSI in the two and multi-party cases which can be used in vertically partitioned data They use commutative oneway hash functions through which parties transform their private sets and compute the intersection of these sets In this protocol each party rst converts its binary vector to a nonbinary one by keeping the order of ones in the original vector For instance if a party has a vector V 1  0  0  1  1  0  1  it will be transformed to V  1  4  5  7  Although the protocol is not dealing with binary vectors any more at the end of the protocol each party knows the number of 1ês in the private vectors belonging to the other parties Zhan et al  introduced tw o algorithms in the tw o and multi-party cases for privacy-preserving association rule mining when data is vertically partitioned among the parties They used additive homomorphic encryption as the main building block In the two-party case one party say P 1  after generating encryption and decryption keys selects a random vector R and a random number X and sends e  A 1 i  R i  X  to P 2  in which A 1 i and R i are the i th item of P 1 s vectors A 1  and R  respectively P 2 then computes n  i 1 e  A 1 i  R i  X   A 2 i and sends it to P 1  P 1  by decrypting this number and computing mod X of the decrypted value obtains the result of the dot product The main problem in this protocol is that the rst party by knowing R and X  after decrypting the number received from P 2 and before computing mod X of the result can gure out P 2 s private vector with high probability We give a simple example to show the security problem of the protocol Suppose A 1 1  0  0  1  1  1 and A 2 1  0  1  0  0  1 respectively belong to P 1 and P 2  and also that P 1 selects R 5   3  2  1  4  6 and X 11  Therefore P 1 sends  e 56 e   33 e 22 e 12 e 45 e 67 to P 2  P 2 computes e 56  e 22  e 67 because the other components of A 2 are zero and sends it back to P 1 Now P 1 rst decrypts this number and obtains 145 and then computes 145 mod 11 which is 2 Next P 1  by using these two numbers is able to arrange different possible combinations for A 2 and to decrease them to the ones that satisfy the result In this example 1  0  1  0  0  1 is the only vector satisfying the nal result Thus the number of possible vectors for A 2 decreases to 1 and P 1 can exactly obtain P 2 s private vector The main reason for information leakage and security problems in is that it w orks directly with binary v alues which restricts the possible values of the second partyês vector Also the information received by the parties is not balanced i.e the rst party receives more information than the second party which helps the former to reduce the privacy of the latter Our protocol is completely balanced both parties having the same amount of intermediate information through the protocol We also work with non-binary vectors after the rst step and therefore the possible values are not restricted to 0 and 1  For the multi-party case in the public k e y and the private key e and d  as well as the integer number X are known to all parties except one  P n  Therefore the possibility of P n knowing these values is very high Although it is assumed that parties involved in the protocol are semihonest by conspiring between P n and only one party among P 1 to P n  1  e  d  and X are transferred to P n and the other parties private vectors will be revealed to P n  However in our protocol for the multi-party case only two parties P 1  and P n need to be trusted to not transfer private key d note that d is only known to P 1  and permutation   to the other parties None of the other parties is able to help a party breach the protocolês security VI F UTURE WORK AND CONCLUSIONS In this paper two secure and efìcient protocols have been presented for privacy-preserving association rule mining in the two and multi-party cases when data is vertically partitioned among the parties These protocols use two new sub-protocols that use additive homomorphic encryption for secure binary dot product and cardinality of set intersection We have also reviewed the existing protocols in this area and have pointed out some of their potential security problems The comparison of these work to ours shows that our proposed protocols can avoid these possible security shortcoming while achieving a better communication and computational performance One possible future direction is to apply our new sub-protocols as building blocks in other privacy-preserving data mining techniques such as sequential pattern mining support vector machines classiìcation and clustering especially when using binary data where preserv 


ing privacy is more difìcult because the attribute values are restricted to 0 and 1 VII A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was partially supported by a grant from Ontario Centres of Excellence OCE R EFERENCES

Figure 3 Precision-recall curve in ROI-250 image dataset 5.3 Experiment 3 Mammograms-1080 image dataset This experiment employed a dataset composed by 1080 mammograms images collected in the Clinical Hospital of University of Sao Paulo at Ribeiro Preto The dataset was previously classi\002ed into 4 levels of breast tissue density 0501\051 mostly fatty 050362 images\051 0502\051 partly fatty 050446 images\051 0503\051 partly dense 050200 images\051 and 0504\051 mostly dense 05072 images\051 Figure 4 Precision-recall curve in Mammography-1080 image dataset Breast density is an important risk factor in the development of breast cancer In this experiment the images are represented by the feature set proposed in b uilding a vector of 85 features including shape and size of the breast the conditions of the breast contour nipple position and the distribution of 002broglandular tissue This dataset was divided in training set and test set The training set is composed of 720 images and test set is composed of 360 images Figure 4 shows the P&R curves over test dataset and also the number of features selected in each method Again the proposed methods reached the highest values of precision and select the smallest number of features 050a\051 050b\051 050c\051 050d\051 Figure 5 Queries in Mammography dataset 050a\051 226 is the query image 050b\051 using the features selected through 002tness function F cB  050c\051 using the features selected through classi\002cation error of C4.5 and 050d\051 using the all features extracted Results for the retrieval of the 5 most similar images from a query image are also provided in this experiment as illustrated in Figure 5 The image 5.\050a\051 is the query image taken from the mostly fatty image class Images shown in 5.\050b\051 are the 5 most similar images retrieved for the proposed 002tness function F cB  The row 050c\051 shows the results for C 4  5 classi\002er whereas 050d\051 illustrate the images resulting from all features 050no selection applied\051 In Figure 5 the images surrounded by dashed lines are false positives 050not relevant images\051 For this query the proposed method achieved the highest precision 050100%\051 when compared the results of C4.5 and the original feature vector 050precision of 40%\051 


6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
