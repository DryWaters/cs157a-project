which supports both forward and backward secrecy in UWSNs We show that the stored data based on our scheme can be used to ef\036ciently compute statistic values e.g expected value and variance of the sensed data and at the same time the storage cost is signi\036cantly reduced using our scheme Detailed analysis has been conducted to evaluate the scheme in terms of ef\036ciency and security 
I I NTRODUCTION Research aspects of security in Wireless Sensor Networks WSNs has gained some progress recently in the research community Most proposed security schemes however are based on assumption that a trusted party sink or base station is always available leading to that unnormal actions of 
compromised sensors can be detected by the on-line sink  However in Unattended WSNs UWSNs there is no static sink but a mobile sink periodically accesses the UWSN to collect data instead and the sensor nodes store their sensed data locally or at some special designated nodes within the network till a mobile sink visit instead of immediately forwarding the data to a centralized location out of the network In such a network a mobile adversary we denote it as 
ADV 
hereafter which behaves in UWSNs when the mobile sink is absent can steal data stored in compromised sensors without modifying any sensed data and interfering with communications of any sensors In other words the 
mobile adversary is 
read-only 
data during the mobile sink visiting interval which is impossible to detect by the mobile sink When a sensor is compromised as the corresponding secret key is also revealed the mobile adversary can obtain the encrypted data using the secret key Therefore providing data con\336dentiality is a big challenge Additionally in the unattended areas such as environment monitoring in humanbeing unfriendly areas the users of UWSNs usually interested in some 323history\323 data rather 323live\323 data For instance what is the average temperature in one month what is the average activities of volcano in half a year etc Furthermore in 
contrast with traditional WSNs the sensors cannot of\337oad data to an on-line sink at will instead they will store the data locally till a mobile sink accesses it to retrieve the data Transmission happens only when the mobile sink visits the UWSN and broadcasts data retrieval requests Consequently each sensor must accumulate sensed data and have ability to wait 
long enough 
until a mobile sink visits it Since the memory size of sensor nodes is limited the storage ef\336ciency problem has to be solved In this paper we propose a novel homomorphic encryption and key evolution based scheme for ef\336cient and secure data storage In our scheme secret keys of sensors are updated 
in each round according to one-way hash function In other words previous keys cannot be derived from current keys Forward secrecy is guaranteed Additionally storing data collected by sensors are encrypted by using homomorphic encryption and stored as sum of encrypted data and sum of encrypted data squares in sensor memory Thus statistic values such as expected value variance value can be easily computed based on those encrypted data values which can signi\336cantly reduce the storage needs Furthermore combined with homomorphic encryption and key evolution our scheme can guarantee both forward secrecy and backward secrecy We show through detailed analysis that our scheme has low storage cost and low computational cost as compared to other existing 
schemes and can be suitable for resource-constraint UWSNs The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II introduces the background and related work In Section III the network model and threat model are addressed Section IV provides the detailed description of our proposed schemes Section V analyzes performance of the scheme Finally Section VI concludes the paper II B ACKGROUND AND R ELATED WORK In this section we introduce related work and some necessary background for our proposed scheme 
Achieving data con\336dentiality in UWSNs is a big challenge because there is no an on-line sink presented The authors

 III N ETWORK M ODEL T HREAT M ODEL AND N OTATIONS This section presents our network model threat model and notations A Network Model We consider a UWSN that consists of N sensor nodes A sensor node in UWSN is denoted as s i 1  i  N   There is a mobile sink that visits the UWSN periodically to collect data It can be more than one sink in practice For simplicity we consider only one mobile sink in the paper The sensor s i generates data at every round and the data generated at round r is denoted as d r i  Since sensors have speciﬁc sensing task we assume that data generated in each round requires the same memory where the data are operated in GF 2 p   that is p  log 2  d r i    r  0 R   where R is the number of rounds between successive sink visits We further assume that the data d r i generated in each round is not a large value e.g p 64 or 160  etc here we don’t consider audio WSN and multimedia WSN Once a data value d r i is generated d r i is stored locally and waits until an authorized mobile sink requires them ofﬂoad it Each sensor has the ability to perform one-way hashing and symmetric key encryption We assume that the mobile sink is a trusted party which cannot be compromised Additionally the mobile sink will ofﬂoad the data accumulated in sensor nodes re-initializes the secret keys and reset the round counters when the mobile sink visits the network B Threat Model In this paper we investigate that ADV that is only interested in stealing read-only the data from the compromised sensor nodes and cannot be detected by the mobile sink ADV can compromise sensor nodes during the time interval when the mobile sink is absent Consequently the mobile adversary can visit the UWSN again and again until the whole network is compromised by it without knowing by the mobile sink Here we assume that an adversary can compromise up to v  v<N  sensors in one interval C Notations Our notation is listed in Table I TABLE I Notation  K m master key of a mobile sink K r i

IV P ROPOSED S CHEME In this section we propose a family of four schemes for efﬁcient and secure data storage Our goal is to guarantee both forward and backward secrecy while maintaining low storage cost and low computation cost A Scheme 1  S 1  Initially the mobile sink picks a master key denoted as K m  The initial key of a sensor node s i can be computed as K i  h  K m  i  which is setup before the deployment of the UWSN Here  stands for the concatenation operator The mobile sink needs to store only one key because it can use K m to compute all the secret keys deployed in s i  1  i  N  Then at round r  1  as it collects data sensor s i encrypts data d r i with K i by Enc  K i d r i   Computation of expected value and variance  1 To compute expected value the mobile sink needs to retrieve the encrypted data Enc  d 1 i  Enc  d 2 i    Enc  d r i    Enc  d R i  from the sensor s i  and then decrypts the encrypted data using its master key K m by generating corresponding secret key that is K i  h  K m  i   For plaintext data d 1 i d 2 i   d r i   d R i  the expected value of data can be easily computed as EX i   R r 1 d r i R  1 2 The variance of data can be computed as Var i   R r 1  d r i  EX i  2 R  2 Discussion  Before the mobile sink retrieves the data the sensor s i generates R rounds data So the storage cost of encrypted data in sensor memory can be denoted as  R r 1 log 2  Enc  d r i  Ifthevalue R tends to be a very large value e.g 100000 the storage cost tends to a large value as well Since our goal is to get expected value and variance of data we transform Eq.\(2 as following Var i   R r 1  d r i  2 R    R r 1 d r i R  2   R r 1  d r i  2 R    R r 1 d r i  2 R 2  3 


Given Sum R i   R r 1 d r i and SumS R i   R r 1  d r i  2 Eq 1 and Eq 3 can be further presented as EX i  Sum R i  R  4 and Var i  SumS R i R   Sum R i  2 R 2  5 In other words to compute EX i and Var i  the mobile sink need to get Sum R i  SumS R i  and R instead Note that the storage cost of sensors can be largely reduced if Sum R i and SumS R i are stored instead of storing the encryptions of data generated in each rounds Proposition 4.1 The storage cost of Sum R i and SumS R i is less than storing the encryptions of data generated in each rounds if R 1 and p 1  Since in UWSN setting given R tends to a very large value e.g 10000 and p is a xed small value the storage cost reduce signiﬁcantly as shown in Fig 1 if Sum R i and SumS R i are stored instead Thus these motivate us to design a data summation scheme that can reduce storage cost B Scheme 2  S 2  The S 2 is detailed as follows Initially the sensor s i allocates two parameters Sum 0 i and SumS 0 i in its memory which denote summation of data and summation of data square respectively The main process is shown in Algorithm 1 At the end of the rst round the sensor s i generates the data d 1 i  computes its square  d 1 i  2  initializes Sum 1 i  d 1 i and SumS 1 i  d 1 i  2  encrypts them as EncSum 2 i and EncSumS 2 i  and then stores them in its memory At the end of each round r  the sensor s i decrypts the EncSum r  1 i and EncSumS r  1 i to get the summation of previous data Sum r  1 i   d r  1 i and the summation of previous data square SumS r  1 i    d r  1 i  2  adds current data and data square to them and stores the encrypted results EncSum r i and EncSumS r i on local memory Computation of expected value and variance Afterthe mobile sink retrieves the EncSum R i and EncSumS R i  it can decrypt them to get summation of data Sum R i and data square SumS R i  Then the expected value and variance can be easily computed by Eq 4 and Eq 5 Discussion  The scheme reduces the storage cost However as shown in Algorithm 1 steps 6,7 and 11,12 in order to obtain Sum r i and SumS r i  the sensor s i needs to encrypts    sensor s i starts round r   collect new sensed data d r i  1 if r 1 then 2 set Sum r i  d r i  3 set SumS r i  d r i  2  4 else 5 compute Sum r i  Dec  EncSum r  1 i   d r  1 i  6 compute SumS r i  Dec  EncSumS r  1 i    d r  1 i  2  7 compute Sum r i  Sum r  1 i  d r i  8 compute SumS r i  SumS r  1 i  d r i  2  9 end 10 compute EncSum r i  Enc  Sum r i K i r    11 compute EncSumS r i  Enc  SumS r i K i r    12 store EncSum r i  EncSumS r i on local storage 13    end round r   Algorithm 1  Scheme 2 and decrypts data at each round which causes very high computation burden This limitation motivates us to design next scheme that can reduce computation cost and yet maintain low storage cost C Scheme 3  S 3  To deal with the limitation in S 2  we now propose a homomorphic encryption based scheme In this scheme we utilize additive homomorphic encryption to encrypt new sensed data such that sum of encrypted data corresponds to encryption of those message summation that is Enc  d r i  Enc  d r i K i M  d r i  K i  mod M  6 and Enc  d r i  2  Enc  d r i  2 K i M   d r i  2  K i  mod M    Due to the properties of additive homomorphic encryption we can obtain Enc  d r i  d r 1 i  Enc  d r i  Enc  d r 1 i   Thus EncSum and EncSumS can be obtained by EncSum  Enc  R  r 1 d r i  R  r 1 Enc  d r i  SumEnc 7 and EncSumS  Enc  R  r 1  d r i  2  R  r 1 Enc  d r i  2  SumEncS Therefore the sensor s i does not need to decrypt and encrypt at each round to get Sum and SumS butsimply add the encrypted data up SumEnc R i   R r 1 Enc  d r i  and SumEncS R i   R r 1 Enc  d r i  2   In the end of round r  as shown in Algorithm 2 the sensor s i encrypt the data d r i by using homomorphic encryption and its secret key K i  that is Enc  d r i  Enc  K i d r i M  d r i  K i  mod M   Each encrypted data is added with previous encrypted data and stored locally SumEnc R i   R r 1 Enc  d r i   R r 1 d r i  R  K i  mod M   and SumEncS R i   R r 1 Enc  d r i  2   R r 1  d r i  2  R  K i  mod M    Here M and M  are deﬁned as M  2 log 2  d max  R max  and M  2 log 2  d max  2  R max   We can see that actually M and M  are the storage costs of EncSum and EncSumS  respectively To decrypt the EncSum and EncSumS  by computing the corresponding secret key by R  K i  R  h  K m  i   the mobile sink can get SumEnc and SumEncS as following    sensor s i starts round r   collect new sensed data d r i  1 compute Enc  d r i  Enc  d r i K i M  d r i  K i  mod M   2 compute 3 Enc  d r i  2  Enc  d r i  2 K i M    d r i  2  K i  mod M    if r 1 then 4 SumEnc r i  Enc  d r i   5 SumEncS r i  Enc  d r i  2   6 else 7 compute SumEnc r i  SumEnc r  1 i  Enc  d r i   8 compute SumEncS r i  SumEncS r  1 i  Enc  d r i  2   9 end 10 store SumEnc r i  SumEncS r i on local storage 11    end round r   Algorithm 2  Scheme 3 


Sum  Dec  EncSum  Dec  SumEnc   Dec  R  r 1 Enc  d r i   R  r 1 Enc  d r i   R  K i  mod M   R  r 1 d r i 8 and SumS  Dec  EncSumS  Dec  SumEncS   Dec  R  r 1 Enc  d r i  2   R  r 1 Enc  d r i  2   R  K i  mod M    R  r 1  d r i  2  9 Computation of expected value and variance  After the mobile sink retrieves the SumEnc and SumEncS  it can decrypt them according to Eq 8 and Eq 9 to get Sum and SumS by using key R  K i  Then the expected value and variance can be easily computed according to Eq 4 and Eq 5 An Example  For simplicity we assume that the sensor s 5 generates 3 rounds data d 1 5 11  d 2 5 23  and d 3 5 18  and sets its corresponding secret key K 5 80 with M  100  and M   1000  Based on Eq.\(6 s 5 can compute the encryption of data at the end of round 1 that is Enc  d 1 5  d 1 5  K 5  mod M   11+80 mod 100  91  then s 5 stores 91 on its local memory At the end of round 2 s 5 generates new data d 2 5 18  then it gets the encryption of new data by Enc  d 2 5   23  80 mod 100  3 Next s 5 does the additive homomorphic encryption to get sum of data SumE  Enc  d 1 5  Enc  d 2 5   mod 100  91  3 mod 100  94  And then it stores the SumEnc 94 on its memory Following the same procedure at the end of round 3 the s 5 get SumEnc   3 r 1 Enc  d r 5   mod 100  82 If the mobile sink retrieves the SumEnc from the s 5 itcan decrypt it by Dec  SumEnc  Dec  EncSum  Sum for SumEnc  EncSum based on Eq 7 that is Sum  Dec 94  94  3  80 mod 100  42  The SumS can be obtained following the same approach Therefore the mobile sink can easily compute the EX 5 and Var 5 based on Eq.\(4 and Eq.\(5 Discussion  Comparing to the S 2 the S 3 supports both low storage cost and low computation cost However a problem is raised if a ADV compromises the sensor s i at round r  The secret key K i of s i is hold by the ADV  Consequentially all the data generated in previous rounds r  0 r   will be revealed because the ADV can use K i to compute corresponding secret key  r   1  K i  Furthermore new generated encrypted data are also encrypted by the same key which means generated data can be decrypted by ADV by using the key K i as well To guarantee both forward secrecy and backward secrecy we propose the next scheme D Scheme 4 S 4  If the sensor keeps the secret unchanging all encrypted data can be read by ADV  no matter the data are generated before or after the compromised period for it only needs to compromise the sensor once and gets the secret key consequently Therefore we need to change the secret key after each round to guarantee that the ADV who holds the secret key K r i in compromised period r   r  r   cannot derive the secret key K  r i in the previous rounds  r  0 r    To solve this problem we utilize key evolution approach that is t he secret k e y o f a sensor node is updated by its owner The secret key of s i in round r is computed as K r i  h r  1  K 1 i   where h    is an oneway hash function  K r  1 i is then securely erased After the secret key K r i updates itself at the end of round r the ADV cannot derive the previous round’s key before the sensor was compromised due to h    one-way property Additionally the mobile sink can easily compute the corresponding secret key of sensor s i in round r for K r i  h r  1  K i  h r  1  K m  i   To decrypt the EncSum and EncSumS  similar to Eq 8 and Eq 9 after computing the corresponding secret key as  R r 1 K r i   R r 1 h r  1  K m  i   the mobile sink can get SumEnc and SumEncS as following Sum  Dec  EncSum  Dec  SumEnc   Dec  R  r 1 Enc  d r i   R  r 1 Enc  d r i   R  r 1 K r i  mod M   R  r 1 d r i 10 and SumS  Dec  EncSumS  Dec  SumEncS   Dec  R  r 1 Enc  d r i  2   R  r 1 Enc  d r i  2   R  r 1 K r i  mod M    R  r 1  d r i  2  11 Similar to S 3 the S 4 has the same homomorphic encryption and decryption process but the secret key Algorithm 3 shows the operation process in sensor s i      sensor s i starts round r   collect new sensed data d r i  1 compute Enc  d r i  Enc  d r i K r i M  d r i  K r i  mod M   2 compute 3 Enc  d r i  2  Enc  d r i  2 K r i M    d r i  2  K r i  mod M    if r 1 then 4 SumEnc r i  Enc  d r i   5 SumEncS r i  Enc  d r i  2   6 else 7 compute SumEnc r i  SumEnc r  1 i  E r i  8 compute SumEncS r i  SumEncS r  1 i  E 2 r i  9 end 10 store SumEnc  SumEncS on local storage 11 compute K r 1 i  h  K r i   12 erase K r i securely 13    end round r   Algorithm 3  Scheme 4 


Computation of expected value and variance Afterthe mobile sink retrieves the SumEnc and SumEncS itcan decrypt them by it can decrypt them by Eq 10 and Eq 11 to get Sum and SumS using the corresponding secret key  R r 1 K r i  Then the expected value and variance can be easily computed by Eq 4 and Eq 5 Proposition 4.2 The S 4 can provide forward secrecy as well as backward secrecy Proof Since key evolution is adopted in the S 4 the ADV cannot derive the previous key from the current key it hold due to the one way property of hash function thus the ADV cannot decrypt the data encrypted in previous rounds which means the forward secrecy is guaranteed Moreover the data generated in previous rounds are stored as SumEnc and SumEncS in sensor nodes To decrypt them the corresponding secret key  R r 1 K r i is needed which consists of all keys generated in each rounds Since the previous keys cannot be derived from current key the corresponding key  R r 1 K r i cannot be obtained by ADV  that means backward secrecy is guaranteed Therefore the S 4 can guarantee both forward secrecy and backward secrecy  V A NALYSIS In this section we investigate numeric performance of the proposed schemes with respect to storage cost and computational cost Security analysis is also given in this section A Storage Cost Fig.1 left shows the analysis results of proposed schemes in term of storage cost We can observe that the S 1 has the highest storage cost in all four proposed schemes no matter p 64 or 128  and that the rest three scheme has the lowest storage cost that means the storing summation of data can signiﬁcantly reduce the storage cost in sensors We further observe that the storage cost of S 2  S 3  and S 4 are almost zero when they are compared with S 1  and the inﬂuence of p cannot be identiﬁed Therefore as shown in Fig.1 right we ignore the storage cost of S 1  where only S 2  S 3  and S 4 areplottedintermsof p 64 and p  128  respectively We observe that p can increases with a little inﬂuence on the storage cost 0 5000 10000 0 5 10 15 x 10 5 The number of rounds \(round Storage Cost \(bit 0 500 1000 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 The number of rounds \(round

schemes B Computation Cost In S 1  sensors encrypts data sensed in each round and stores them locally In S 3 and S 4  sensors encrypts data by doing simply modulo arithmetic in each round which based on homomorphic encryption In S 2  however sensors decrypts encrypted data sum updates new data sum and encrypts it again which causes extra computational cost C Security Analysis In S 1  S 2  and S 3  both forward secrecy and backward secrecy cannot be guaranteed for the secret key is the same in each round Once the secret key is compromised all the encrypted data are revealed As discussed in Section IV-D Proposition 4.2 the S 4 can guarantee both forward secrecy and backward secrecy Finally we summarize the comparison results between S 1  S 2  S 3 and S 4 in TABLE II in terms of storage cost computation cost Forward Secrecy FSe and Backward Secrecy ASe TABLE II shows the conclusion that S 4 has the best conformance compared with the rest three schemes in terms of storage cost and computation cost and that S 4 can further guarantee forward secrecy and backward secrecy TABLE II Performance comparison results between proposed schemes in terms of Storage Cost Computation Cost

Likelihood function decomposition enables the derivation of multi-target tracking and data fusion algorithms for heteroge\255 neous multi-source data types from a unified point of view This is important not only theoretically but also in practice because it means that tracking algorithms derived via likeli\255 hood decomposition can accommodate a dynamically chang\255 ing mix of the sensor types comprising the heterogeneous field Likelihood function decomposition provides a rigorous yet intuitive method to fuse state constraints into the tracking al\255 gorithm Such constraints include for example operational geographic constraints such as no ships on land This capabil\255 ity is achieved in a straightforward method by restricting the manifold Likelihood function decomposition greatly simplifies the un\255 conditional data likelihood function This is important since it greatly reduces the computational complexity of a quan\255 tity vital to clutter rejection In the special case of linear\255 Gaussian Kalman filters the unconditional likelihood func\255 tion is written explicitly in terms of the innovation sequence 55 56 57 I I I v 2 225 1 1 1 1 9 E E I 91 I 0'1 2  M M 1 1 1 1 I 1 H U f a W N x dz n  falling in the forbidden region are simply truncated and eliminated from the decomposition Note that the left side of 60 is linear in the measurement Zl and non-linear in target state  Path distortion effects due to propagation in nonisotropic me\255 dia can be mitigated provided the medium is sufficiently well understood that the path distortions can be modeled The dis\255 tortion model is essentially a change of variables applied to the original likelihood function decomposition The trans\255 formed decomposition merely replaces the original decom\255 position Y\(zd q\(Zl in IR a neighborhood in Let which need not coincide with be an arbitrary random vari\255 able i.e an integrable function Let 1 7 o Equation 54 is an approximation of the marginal o Similarly 27T 0'1 0'1 The integral 27T o The sense in which this converges to the marginal O'r is illustrated by returning to the one-dimensional case Let Unconditional Data Likelihood I\(u for 0 by 1 1 Non-isotropic Media and and 7\(Zl 59 60 u eUc/>\(Z n n n n a eUq,\(z x as 0'1 as 0'1 as 0'1 x 1 State Constraints x dZ 1 x dZ 1  54 such that while the situation is reversed on the right side Y\(gl\(X 58 of the decomposition to the region of the state space to which targets are confined Equivalently those parts of the manifold 2"1  To apply the Laplace formula 47 we need a local maximum of 242 for fixed If of of n-1 242\(z then takes the form Note that Substitution of 5 into the left side of Unified Tracking in Heterogeneous Fields 242\(z W identity matrix Then using 47 exp x dZ x dZ 1 yields the right side with 92\(X   9n\(X For x h\(z 53 Smoothness conditions on where Simplifying and rearranging terms gives as 0 where the right side of the equation involves the square of the Euclidean norm of The Laplace formula 43 yields The maximum of 242 occurs at the minimum of that norm which is zero at  91 91      91   JRn-1 Y\(zd q\(Zl and 9 induce similar conditions and a function Exis\255 tence and other properties of this maximum follow from the Implicit Function Theorem We adapt the notation used in the statement of this theorem in Section 9.28 on page 244 of 4 Define Hessian ma\255 trix of dZ a 2  n zc eXP[--22b1\(Zc Y\(Zl q\(zll x dZ Y\(gl x Zl JR 1 n-1 IRn-1 Z2   zn ZC H 2  n zc I\(u 0'1 27T IRn 1/J JRn-1 Zl,1/J\(Zl 1/J\(Zl Zl 1/J\(b Zc X Zl Y\(Zl dZ 1 U 8\(9\(X 7\(Zl with respect to I\(n-1 x\(n-1 denote the 7 UTILITY OF LINEAR DECOMPOSITIONS Zl 1/J\(Zl where the right side of the formula is the additive inverse of the     x u\(n-1 1 Y\(zd q\(Zl x  q\(zlx 2 267\267\267dz n JIRn-1 z b U u 1 Y\(Zl q\(Zl in particular r h\(z Jdet\(-H 2  n zc 242\(zd I'\(Zl f\(Zl 0'1  1 91\(X  u\(n-1 242 achieves a maximum at Zl 0 where we have made use of 2 Together these imply 0 for any random variable  x x 8 0 since 0 by 49 The Implicit Function Theorem asserts that there is a neighborhood  0 whenever  4 In lV

  10  SV Technical Requireme nts Document \(FFP-3 227 Following the validation of critical outcomes and standards the acquiring agency should release a comprehensive systems requirements document that elaborates on the desired outcomes for the system by detailing significant system and subsystem requirements.  Some may suggest that this element is not required and it should be the responsibility of the developer to derive from the required capabilities and outcomes. However, in most cases, the agency has expectations for design development and test.  If the developer is expected to derive system or test requirements without the guidance that a comprehensive requirements document would provide there is likely to be serious discrepancies in the approaches taken with respect to requirements and standards A good example of this can be seen in the development practices for the Space Test Program.  The Space Test Program will commonly take risks in accepting a single string spacecraft design due to mass and volume constraints associated with their space lif t opportunities. However, in order to mitigate that risk, rigorous test requirements which may not be typically required for an S&T such as full MILSTD 1540-E are commonly levied to screen for workmanship issues and infant mortality.  Without these detailed specifications being documented in a technical requirements document to the developer it is unlikely that they would adopt the preferred approach.  This would result in extra time and cost expended in order to come to a consensus Space Vehicle System Specification \(FFP-4 227  This view represents the complete set of requirements associated with the system and the methods that will be used to demonstrate this requirement.  The requirements specification should demonstrate how requirements are organized at the system, sub-system and component levels Recommendations for how to construct this view are well documented in some Data Item Descriptions \(DID\s proposed formatting does allo w for tailoring and does not have specific requirements associated with how the document is prepared or managed.  However, careful consideration should be paid to the approach that is taken Several tools exist that make use of databases to allow the user and the developer to trace requirements compliance from the component to the syst em level.  This capability significantly enhances the ability to work with the information and assess changes as they are encountered throughout the design process.  This is important in the S&T environment because it allows the individuals associated with design trades to more effectively understand the impacts of change throughout the development process These lessons can be applie d into final interface control documentation and used to assess overall suitability entering the review.  If there are issues encountered during these activities, mitigations should be developed prior to a final design review in order to ensure that developers can successfully transition from design to integration at completion of the review.  These steps will help all parties validate the design and give them the requisite data to make informed decisions when planning for later phases of the mission  Preliminary System Design  The name for this phase can be somewhat of a misnomer Even though the first iterations of the design process is made, there are many elements which need to be completely solidified at this point in the design process.  Additionally this tends to be the point in the project where detailed interface boundaries and specifica tions must be developed among sub-systems and systems As can be seen in Figure 5, much of the effort expended throughout this phase is dedicated to resolving various design decisions and trades.  Tools that assist both the program developer and procuring agency add structure and organization to this time are particularly important.  Many of the systems architecture products that were mentioned previously \(i.e. schedule and CDRL list\in the chapter play a significant role in aiding this process The preliminary design phase is unique because although the review marks the closure of the phase, some milestones that are of equal or greater importance must occur before this happens.  As individual subsystem and system designs emerge and component trades for the various systems are developed, it becomes apparent that orders must be placed before the any design review occurs. This is to have longlead products delivered by the close of the design phase This can be very difficult b ecause, usually, the components that fall into this category are some of the most important system elements \(avionics flight computers and transceivers additional challenge for the systems engineering team to ensure the requirements and interfaces for the component and the systems are properly vetted.   This is where the program can heavily leverage system architecting products.   Table 4 lists the relevant architectural information for this phase System Subsystem Design Specific ations \(DIV-3, SV-5, OV6A, SV-10B 227  At the culmination of this phase the initial design for each subsystem and the system as a whole should be well understood.  Several Aerospace reference documents detail all of the pertinent design elements for the various subsystems.  However, what is often not seen are common views for how the information should be represented among the various subsystems ensuring that the approach the various developers have for conveying information translates well from subsystem to subsystem.  This is not to say that each presentation needs to be structured identically

  12 Table 5. Recommended Design Review Common Views Design Review Information Purpose Physical Functional View  This view would illustrate all of the components within the system and highlight their functional responsibility within the system as a whole.  If the system was software intensive, component references may be less important than identifying the software tasks and their relationship within the system   This view\(s\the different operating states or modes of the system Data Transfer View Demonstrate how data moves throughout the subsystem/system in both hardware and software. Illustrate the various ways that format is altered in the process Reliability Views Analysis\222 showing sub-system reliability and the supporting data/methods implemented Subsystem and component flight heritage pedigree Identify any limited life items within the system to properly identify constraints and risks associated with the development Technical Budgets Performance View Identify the system requirements and the expected design performance, demonstrate that design has sufficient margin per industry standards \(AIAA\given level of maturity Define the level of analysis/ simulation required to demonstrate the suitability of systems  At first glance it can be seen that the views suggested by various SMEs closely resemble the various DoDAF2.0 viewpoints.  This suggests that the recommended views address the different aspects of design from a fairly complete set of perspectives  Interface control documents al so need to be reviewed carefully in order to ensure that the proper information is included within the document.  In several instances ambiguous references to existing standards have resulted in compatibility problems.  Specifically, when selecting command and telemetry data protocols. particular attention needs to be paid to ensure the view completely demonstrates the planned implementation.  In the recent past, references to standards such as CCSDS have given system developers the false security that a format is well understood.  Away to eliminate such ambiguities is to include sample data references in the views that can be reviewed and decomposed by the receiving agency to ensure that a consensus is reached  Operational Environments \(FFP-7 227   A critical element of component and system design is finalizing the environmental conditions that the space vehicle will experience throughout launch and upon separation.  This can be complicated in the S&T environment, because there ar e instances where acquisition begins without a complete understanding of what launch vehicle environments will be experienced.  Regardless whether or not this is known, a best effort needs to be made to indentify an enveloping environment for testing as early as possible.  In many instan ces insufficient testing can put undue risk to testing at the sp ace vehicle and drive cost later in the program.  Also, incorrect assumptions regarding notching can lead to potential susceptibilities.  The acquiring agency should strive to define environment at the launch vehicle interface before any requirements are flown for component level testing.  This will pay large dividends later in the program by avoiding very extensive and costly tests and analysis later in the program.  If there is some level of uncertainty that cannot be resolved prior to component level procurement, the acquiri ng agency must either accept the risk or plan for significant cost growth later in the program.  Documentation that details the tests environments for each component and the test methods used for verification will help in baselining expectations.  A matrix that identifies verification me thods will help ensure that there is consensus is an e ffective method for accomplishing this  A satellite failure demonstrates an example of what can occur if environments aren\222t well understood.  In this case decisions were made regarding notching launch vehicle environments at low frequencies, serendipitously in the same range a launch vehicle mode existed. Furthermore, the telemetry received from the la unch vehicle indicated that the rocket exceeded its maximu m predicted environment in the same range.   In this case, when the space vehicle was not able to be contacted on orbit a potential cause for failure was determined to be incorrect notching strategies during vibration testing.   Although root cause cannot be positively confirmed, data that shows what environments the system elements should be tested will allow all agencies to understand the risk that is be ing accepted early and develop mitigation strategies if they are required later in the program Final System Design At this point in the development a focused effort needs to be made early in the phase to finalize interfaces and resolve any lingering trades.  As pre liminary designs are accepted, a review of each subsystem needs to be completed before the remaining procurement decisions are finalized and production planning can begin. Figure 6 depicts the detailed systems design process Reviews should be thorough, include appropriate stakeholders and mission assurance bodies to ensure decisions are made in an informed fashion prior to proceeding into a review.  In terms of systems architecting very little new information is recommended at this phase Instead, the architecture models should act as management

  14 tools to ensure the design is has properly matured, open issues are resolved and form al interface agreements have been driven to closure Table 6 shows the system architecture framework and maturity that is suggested for this phase In order to do this in an effective manner designs and models need to be finalized and circulated with stakeholders ahead of the review.  Al so, for critical interfaces simulations or test with engineering models should be considered to validate a design.  This is especially important when considering interfaces among systems that are near the program critical path. The program CDRL lists and open system trade data models will help assess if this has been completed in a timely manner In many cases for S&T missions, the desire to transition from design to integration rapidly is paramount at this point in the mission.  If this is desired, the element of production planning needs to also be considered at this juncture in the design.  In this case, a detailed model that shows how all developmental items will procured, prepared and tested to support planned integration is critical is assessing the validity of the approach for ensuing phases.  This plan model should show how all elements both flight and nonflight support the baseline schedule or how they are deficient in order to highlight risk areas to mitigate Integrated Production Tracking Tool \(FFP-6 227  There have been many instan ces in the development of systems where a small and relatively inexpensive system element causes a significant schedule delay due to unavailability or oversight in th e product planning effort.  In most instances these issues could have been avoided if comprehensive tools are used to identify all required parts including ground support equipment\and track their availability versus need date for system integration.  This information will be essential in being able to assess the readiness of a group to transiti on from design to integration 5  C ONCLUSIONS  Architecture needs to be pur pose driven.  The value of system architecture is not plainly apparent to many and the existence of regulatory guidance will not force architecting to be well aligned with engineering.   Unless architecting activities for a given system are given a clear purpose, it may be difficult for people to identify how they serve a purpose and immediately are useful and applicable DoDAF V2.0 has come a long way in helping to change the perception of architecture by being data-centric and attempting to re-align system architectures to support the decision making processes within a development.  Given the novelty of version 2.0 que stions of supportability and fusion are still largely left unanswered Tailoring systems architectures to meet the need of a specific development is equally important. Architecting emerged as a concept that was essential for large interoperable systems that required long term sustainment and scalability.   In the sp ace S&T arena where the long term supportability and interoperability aren\222t major concerns,  an architecture needs to be tailored to address the issues that are relevant to th e systems such as  managing the complexity and parallel nature of the development providing tools and views to help a developer see that the system or group of systems mature appropriately.   The flexibility built into DoDAF2.0 with composite and \223Fit For Purpose\224 views were used ex tensively in this effort A systems architecture adopted for this S&T environment needs to be kept simple.  Given the finite nature of the missions in a schedule constrained situation, documentation and excess deliverables are always one of the first cost elements to be cut.   Howeve r, if the architecture artifacts are well aligned with existing program documentation, then benefits emerge.  There is little to no benefit in developing architecture simply to document the design which is contained in other documentation, which may be in a variety of formats and often more detailed.  Keeping it simple will allow the architecture to mature more easily with other design efforts Finally, accessibility of the information is extremely important regardless of the tools or methods employed Providing commonly accessible ar eas where a stakeholder knows how to access the information will bolster the alignment of engineering and architecting.  Both the DOD and industry have tools that are available to assist this, and careful review of several options should be completed ensure that  they meet give n needs prior to selection Significance of Research One of the most important aspects of a space science and technology demonstration is timeliness.  If systems cannot be developed and demonstrated in a timely fashion their applicability is diminished significantly.  While schedule performance is very important there is a tenuous balance between the approach im plemented to accelerate a development and the level of technical rigor required.  If a methods like system architecting can facilitate timeliness by helping to reinforce decision making processes and coordinate appropriate technical review this could add significant utility to the developer and deserves consideration as a method for bolstering systems engineering processes Future Research and Application This effort was primarily focused on understanding DoDAF Version 2.0 applicability and challenges to space system development. , and how strategic changes in 2.0 address some of those issues and offering a example of how it could 


  15 be implemented for a given application \(developmental space systems eful to augment this effort some in different areas Extending the application of this architecture beyond the space domain to other system ty pes would provide valuable insight.  One could begin to see practical \223shared\224 elements beyond DoDAF suggested views. This architecture could also be expanded further in the space development process to include integration  and test and operations and maintenance. Additionally, the adoption and trial of an architecting effort for a deve lopmental space system would provide important feedback on the applicability of the suggested implementation System architecting\222s real value lies in its ability to optimize the manner that information is exchanged among system elements in order facilitate development of the complete system.  The method that is used to achieve this is going to be drastically different based on the actual system, its goals its stakeholders, schedule, funding and many other factors In order to make system architecture relevant and useful it needs be tailored.   Additionally, tailoring needs to extend beyond simply what is included in the model to how and when the information is gathered and must be well aligned with organizational or industry wide practices for development REFERENCES   Depart m e nt of Defe nse.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
