The H olographic N etwork A nalysis   Ivan Demydov   Bohdan Strykhalyuk Mykhailo Klymash  Telecommunications Department  Lviv  Polytechnic  National  University  Lviv  Ukraine  demydov@lp.edu.ua          Abstract   These materials contain the physically  and mathema tically based representation of combined network hyper structures meta properties using their holographic definition and reconstru ction principles as well as similar approaches to representing analyzing prediction and storing of big  amounts of the netw ork related proprietary data are given  Keywords  holography, network, communications, analysis  I  I NTRODUCTION  It is evidently simple on the opinion of physicians to imagine 3D holographic structure at the continuous space furthermore at least 50 years ago s ome pretty examples of photo holographic pictures were created successfully This picture, for example could capture some set of amplitudes and phases of light beams on the planar projection under mirrored from pictured object coherent radiation of laser a nd the direct radiation of same laser \(that has equal time frequency, but not equal phase characteristics to interfere beams mutually [1    T o  restore the initial object optically we need the reference radiation of laser beam to illuminate our holographic planar source written with appropriate holographic picture In principle, it is possible to make a hologram for any wave [1, 2   It is well known to physicians [3 6   u n f o r tu n at ely  n o t s o  t o  the wide public that holographic picture is undividable  by conte nt at least in the dimension D 1  in the sense of pictured object of dimension D It means that given only the little part of the written holographic planar source we could restore the entire initial object picture but with respective worsening of resoluti on For example at holographic reconstruction each region of a photographic plate contains the whole image  3   So evidently the principle described here could be used for any hologram that was created for objects with wave nature On our opinion a w orld meta network containing numerous heterogeneous subnets during its existence provides some periodic or not so periodic processes related to traffic distribution. Considering related sets of nodes, these processes could be represented as a set of wave functions for first examining on the basis of their self similarity The traffic distributing act and routing services implementation into a set of network nodes are wave pulsing processes with physical nature of medium different to light or acoustic beam s on the one hand but introducing broadband photonic nets this contradiction eliminates itself On the other hand all these mutually related processes could be considered numerically as a multi dimensional holographic object Then given the mathematicall  processes we could restore all the defined less dimensional metadata of network properties for some time period using some part of this meta   only It should be network connections stru cture in topology meaning traffic volume amounts distribution, prediction of net behavior due to higher dimension of holographic meta data in the case of known space continuum properties for modified net\ etc  II  C REATING HOLOGRAPHIC MODEL OF THE NETWORK  A  Th e  Rese a rch Subject  So the subject of this work is to determine the methodological basics and to create an approach for common network properties description and restoring extracting mathematically being them digitized at respective network structures wi thin principles of digital holography [7, 8   Therefore we need to consider two important tasks The first one is intended to create the holographic description of time frequency network structure properties Section  2.B\, and the second task will consider  the existing holographic metadata processing for evaluation, prediction and extracting of defined network properties for analyzed network infrastructure  Section  2.C\ and for selected node section Section  2.D  B  The Holographic Definition of Network Prope rties  It is clear that every network node should have numerous means to fix network  obviously be the information intended to be transmitted through the net. We should consider the properties of the traffic behaviors a t each point of the network Permanently these properties are divided to the service network messaging that upgrading the definitions of current network structure for routing purposes and some volume of information which describes the time frequency cha racter of the inter node traffic Appropriate calculation modules should be introduced at every  cloud network structures these ones are situated at the respective network nodes to complete the d ata analysis or service exchange procedures. Thus, we need to describe service traffic and data traffic at the each of N  nodes with number z  using some complex variables 8   I n  o r d e r  to  d esc r i b e  mentioned parameters for these nodes we need to assume that

 they are forming multilayered hyper structure, and every node has own layer z  within its parameterized connections to another ones Such variables are transfer functions for every discrete layer of the network object In other words every node will have i ts own transfer plane with number z  see Fig 1 and   time frequency traffic characteristics namely using common spatial transvers e Cartesian coordinates to characterize mutual   and co location  within the same network space continuum Respectively  a  complex time frequency variables of format  should be considered as  complex  traffic intensity  to respective exchange point of layer \(node z  with coordinates  on the plane, from another exchange point of layer \(node\ situated in the same network space  continuum with common spatial transverse coordinates It was mentioned, that format of these variables is complex, and let us assume that their real part is responsible for service traffic intensity description  due to its  topologic ally depending character\, while the imaginary part is used to determine the internode data traffic amounts due to their structural traversing  and  pulsating  properties  Using  8     1  where f  is the metric distance coefficient of  the network system    is the constant coefficient of the maximum available traffic intensity of the link in the entire network  and  are the pupil and object pu pil functions of a view  and  respectively that should be applied synchronously and    Fig. 1. The network nodes in the discrete network space continuum Links from Node 2 and Node z  to Node 1 are shown  Then after respective calculations and data exchange we need to calculate the common spatial network system impulse response in the cu rrent network space continuum  corresponding to all z  nodes  using IFFT transform as following      2  After these transformations, our multidimensional network proprietary description should be converted and stored to the more compac t complex holographic 2D form     3  Therefore this result is matching with 9  in  th e p a r t o f  planar while excluding z  interconnections numeric analysis  for the int ernode connectivity according to the graph theory  C  Predicting t he Network Proprietary Metadata Using i ts Holographic Representation  Thus in the case of partially network failure all the information will be restored immediately on demand using at least on e digitized copy of holographic network meta properties  Let us to restore the  whole  network proprietary metadata from its holographic representation  using inverse imaging approach 10  f o r  a p r o p e r t ies p r e d i cti o n  ca s e w it h in  new network conditions/structu re Using equation 3 let us convert 2D hologram   of size  into vector of length  g  by lexicographic ordering  Similarly becomes  And for t he prediction purposes the  space continuum impulse response  in the form of at least partially filled modified matrix   is formed from  and gives us  after  lexicographic ordering  Therefore 3 could be rewritten as      4   where  is a length of Gaussian random noises vector Respectively  and   The analytical solution 11  c o u ld  b e r ep r es en te d  as   Here  is a Lagrangian, and 1 is the identity matrix In other form this solution could be represented as [8     5  Where denotes the quadratic form of a vector and the term represents the regularization to the ill posed inverse problem

Solution 5 provides predicted complex values of flows intensity or desirable n etwork hyper structure restored  interconnections\ at the entire modified network structure using previously formed basic network holographic proprietary metadata  D  Sectional Network Proprietary Metadata Reconstr uction  To reconstruct network proprietary metadata partially for desirable network node  we need just use the appropriate number of section  z and convolve the complex hologram with  z  The matched filter should be obtained after 2 as  after that our solution is following [8    6  We should use first resulting term  as a most precious part of the solution and containing respective object of s patial proprietary network structure for selected node described and recovered as undividable part of the whole network using holographic principles The second term is referred to the defocus holographic noise from the rest sections away from the targeted  This term will arise if we would use not so full complex hologram with some parts loosed or excluded due to different reasons. An entire solution should be obtained its real and imaginary parts for the first term and second one respectively. Thus real ly internode traffic should be an imaginary part of solution as was assumed in the Section  2.B. If we wish to use traffic prediction while network is modifying, it should be realized using equation \(6\ similarly in the way presented at the Section  2.C wi thin modified network space continuum impulse response   III  C ONCLUSION  1  The new approaches to analyzing and storing of big  amounts of the network related proprietary data were proposed Network properties are analyzing in their undividabl e entity after the structural topology holographic representation, which well matches their cloud character  2  The ways for traffic analysis and prediction were proposed due to modified network system space continuum holographic properties calculation at le ast partial for some holographic sections and using them for network proprietary features reconstruction within new network conditions/structure  3  As well as entire network proprietary metadata restoring/extracting we could provide its sectional node by no de representation using entire holographic properties of the network  4  A partial loosing or inaccessibility of the holographic properties of the network will affect to the mathematical precision defocusing of the necessary proprietary data extracting resu lt, not the full calculation process  5  In the case of partially network failure all the proprietary information will be restored immediately on demand using at least one digitized copy of holographic network meta properties  6  Holographic network meta proper ties could contain complex proprietary data to describe service structural traffic and traversal network data traffic in the respective described network structure or its parts  7  The approach was proposed is quite similar with tensor analysis  12  but the undividable holographic description of interconnected discrete network objects looks more natural and precise in the continuous world   R EFERENCES  1  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography  2  Denisyuk, Yuri N. \(1962\.

of backward messages b p i k  f m b p i k  006 b p i k g  with i  1  2   N  These messages can be used to resolve the data association problem that is to select the measure from the tar get of interest discarding clutter and other targets detections More speci\002cally assuming to be at time k  we can predict the state at time k  1  propagating f s k through the track model to have f s M k  1  Using 05025\051 we get backward messages b s i k  1  i  1  2   N  Using 05019\051 we obtain b p i k  1  f m b p i k  1  006 b p i k  1 g  where m b p i k  1  f  x k 1 i  y k 1 i g represents the next 050predicted\051 position of the moving object into the image plane of camera C i  and 006 b p i k  1 represents how reliable is the estimate We can construct for each camera C i a prediction window W i around 050 x k 1 i  y k 1 i 051 into the image plane with dimensions determined by 006 b p i k  1  These windows can be seen as the frame portions which restrict the background subtraction algorithm operations In this way if the object is moving without sudden changes in speed and direction 050nearlyconstant-velocity hypothesis\051 the target can be found in the window We have noticed that this solution reduces both the probability to have a noisy estimate 050a very common issue in scenarios full of moving targets\051 and the computational load of the background subtraction algorithm 050an important feature for a real-time implementation of the algorithm\051 The use of backward messages to enhance the sensor data extraction seems to add some dependence between the sensor estimates and the target track However we use such messages only to restrict the portion of image into which to look for the measurement and we do not merge the two estimates In this way we reasonably say that the correlation effect of this procedure is negligible 3 E XPERIMENTS We have tested our framework with real data in various scenarios such as parking lots harbours busy streets etc In this section we report an experiment of state reconstruction of a car maneuvering in a busy parking lot We have deployed three cameras along the walls 050at almost 10-meters height\051 surrounding the parking of our Department in Aversa Italy The cameras are GE E1035 Samsung D70 and Fuji\002lm FinePix S3200 Cameras have been calibrated with data measured by hand in the parking lot and with world points calculated into the reference system showed in Figure 5 Pixel and world coordinates can vary in the following ranges  x y   1  640  1  for Camera 1 2 and 3 and  X Y    000 29  2900  000 40

More speci\002cally Figure 4 regards a step of the pixel extraction algorithm Figure 5 shows the views the three cameras have on the scene and Figure 6 depicts the state trajectory on a Google map image of the parking lot This experiment on real data con\002rms that if the object is moving without strange changes in speed or acceleration the tracker 224hooks\224 the object and follow its state The nearlyconstant-velocity model does not produce highly-reliable estimates in this experiment 050the car is changing its direction\051 but the probabilistic fusion allows it to automatically rely almost only on camera estimates yielding a global reconstruction of the car trajectory The factor graph parameters are T  1  033 0  10 4  050we do not know the initial state of the car\051 033 w  10

paper has focused on fusing data from heterogeneous sources where our a priori knowledge about target dynamics is only one block of the system Information 003ows bi-directionally into the whole system following the rules of gaussian belief propagation where for the non linear blocks we have computed local 002storder approximation We have focused on a con\002guration with multiple cameras However the system is very general and can be easily upgraded to include other sensor modalities such as AIS radar lidar IR camers etc The 003exibility of the factor graph in its normal form is such that when new data sources become available they can be just added to the fusion bus that acts as a probability pipeline Propagation of messages in both forward and backward directions in the graph enhances the quality of the state trajectory estimation There are many directions for future improvements The natural system enhancement is the provision for handling multiple tracks via mixture propagation Camera placement is also a crucial issue for scene coverage and for 3D tracking that will be addressed elsewhere Handling of multiple moving objects requires a merge of pattern recognition and tracking and is a topic of current research work The inclusion of simultaneous multiple track models into the graph is another important issue that will be addressed in the future 5

Figure 7  Simpli\002ed pinhole camera model Camera calibration 11 consists in estimating P or H given a certain number of correspondence points between the world and the image We detail the procedure for 002nding P  since H can be found by straightforward substitution in 05031\051 setting Z  z 0 050taken to be the homography world plane\051 Given the calibration points f 050 x i  y i 051  050 X i  Y i  Z i 051 g  i  1   N we can re-write 05031\051 as 050 x i  025x i  025  p 11 X i  p 12 Y i  p 13 Z i  p 14  p 31 X i  p 32 Y i  p 33 Z i  p 34  y i  025y i  025  p 21 X i  p 22 Y i  p 23 Z i  p 24  p 31 X i  p 32 Y i  p 33 Z i  p 34  i  1   N 05034\051 Finding P can be reduced to the solution of the homogeneous linear system  A p  0  05035\051 with  A  2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 X 1 Y 1 Z 1 1 0 0 0 0 000 x 1 X 1 000 x 1 Y 1 000 x 1 Z 1 000 x 1 0 0 0 0 X 1 Y 1 Z 1 1 000 y 1 X 1 000 y 1 Y 1 000 y 1 Z 1 000 y 1 X 2 Y 2 Z 2 1 0 0 0 0 000 x 2 X 2 000 x 2 Y 2 000 x 2 Z 2 000 x 2 0 0 0 0 X 2 Y 2 Z 2 1 000 y 2 X 2 000 y 2 Y 2 000 y 2 Z 2 000 y 2                                     X N Y N Z N 1 0 0 0 0 000 x N X N 000 x N Y N 000 x N Z N 000 x N 0 0 0 0 X N Y N Z N 1 000 y N X N 000 y N Y N 000 y N Z N 000 y N 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 and p   p 11 p 12 p 13 p 14 p 21 p 22 p 23 p 24 p 31 p 32 p 33 p 34  T  We need at least 5 world-image point matches because P has 10 degrees of freedom As showed in we can obtain the least-squares solution in p by applying singular values decomposition 050SVD\051 on  A and then taking the last column of the last matrix that is returned Rearranging p we get P  B D ERIVATIVES We calculate explicitly the 002rst derivatives de\002ned in 05010\051 Named D h  050 h i 31 X k  h i 32 Y k  h i 33 051  _ D h  050 h i 31 _ X k  h i 32 _ Y k 051  C 11  050 h i 11 _ X k  h i 12 _ Y k 051  C 12  050 h i 11 X k  h i 12 Y k  h i 13 051  C 21  050 h i 21 _ X k  h i 22 _ Y k 051  and C 22  050 h i 21 X k  h i 22 Y k  h i 23 051  we get 050 _ x i k  1  D 2 h  C 11 D h 000 _ D h C 12   f i 3 050 X k  Y k  _ X k  _ Y k 051  _ y i k  1  D 2 h  C 21 D h 000 _ D h C 22   f i 4 050 X k  Y k  _ X k  _ Y k 051  05036\051 In the following we report extended calculations of 000 i elements As stated in 05021\051 Jacobian matrix 000 i is de\002ned as 000 i 050 x y _ x _ y 051  2 6 6 4   X f i 1   Y f i 1 0 0   X f i 2   Y f i 2 0 0   X f i 3   Y f i 3    _ X f i 3    _ Y f i 3   X f i 4   Y f i 4    _ X f i 4    _ Y f i 4 3 7 7 5  05037\051 with elements   X f i 1  1  D 2 h 050 h i 11 D h 000 h i 31 C 12 051    Y f i 1  1  D 2 h 050 h i 12 D h 000 h i 32 C 12 051    X f i 2  1  D 2 h 050 h i 21 D h 000 h i 31 C 22 051    Y f i 2  1  D 2 h 050 h i 22 D h 000 h i 32 C 22 051    X f i 3  1  D 4 h 050\050 C 11 h i 31 000 _ D h h i 11 051 D 2 h 000 2 D h h i 31 050 C 11 D h 000 _ D h C 12 051\051    Y f i 3  1  D 4 h 050\050 C 11 h i 32 000 _ D h h i 12 051 D 2 h 000 2 D h h i 32 050 C 11 D h 000 _ D h C 12 051\051     _ X f i 3  1  D 2 h 050 h i 11 D h 000 h i 31 C 12 051     _ Y f i 3  1  D 2 h 050 h i 12 D h 000 h i 32 C 12 051    X f i 4  1  D 4 h 050\050 C 21 h i 31 000 _ D h h i 21 051 D 2 h 000 2 D h h i 31 050 C 21 D h 000 _ D h C 22 051\051    Y f i 4  1  D 4 h 050\050 C 21 h i 32 000 _ D h h i 22 051 D 2 h 000 2 D h h i 31 050 C 21 D h 000 _ D h C 22 051\051     _ X f i 4  1  D 2 h 050 h i 21 D h 000 h i 31 C 22 051     _ Y f i 4  1  D 2 h 050 h i 22 D h 000 h i 32 C 22 051  05038\051 Calculating the 002rst derivatives of 05013\051 named D r  050 r i 31 x k  r i 32 y k  r i 33 051  _ D r  050 r i 31 _ x k  r i 32 _ y k 051  C 31  050 r i 11 _ x k  r i 12 _ y k 051  C 32  050 r i 11 x k  r i 12 y k  r i 13 051  C 41  050 r i 21 _ x k  r i 22 _ y k 051  and C 42  050 r i 21 x k  r i 22 y k  r i 23 051  we get 050 _ X i k  1  D 2 r  C 31 D r 000 _ D r C 32   g i 3 050 x k  y k  _ x k  _ y k 051  _ Y i k  1  D 2 r  C 41 D r 000 _ D r C 42   g i 4 050 x k  y k  _ x k  _ y k 051  05039\051 As stated in 05016\051 Jacobian matrix J i is de\002ned as J i 050 x y _ x _ y 051  2 6 6 6 4   x g i 1   y g i 1 0 0   x g i 2   y g i 2 0 0   x g i 3   y g i 3    _ x g i 3    _ y g i 3   x g i 4   y g i 4    _ x g i 4    _ y g i 4 3 7 7 7 5  05040\051 7
