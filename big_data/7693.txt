Craniofacial Model Re construction From Skull Data Based on Feature Points    Ronghua Liang, Yao lei Lin, Li Jiang, Jiarui Bao, Xianping Huang  College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310032, China   Abstract  3D craniofacial model reconstruction from skull data has been a challenging research topic for many years. In this paper we develop a craniofacial reconstruction system based on feature points, and our approach only requires the skull model from a 
standard 3D scanner and feature points superimposed on the skull data. Our method consists of three stages hole repairing for the 3D skull model, facial reconstruction with Radial Basis Function\(RBF deformation and texture map ping. A new advancing layer-wise solution algorithm and a template matching method are proposed for repairing big and particular holes on the skull model. The reference face model is then transformed to reconstruct the face model base on marked feature points on the skull model , and we 
improve the RBF deformation.. The experiments demonstrate the high efficiency and visual realism achieved in our approach  1. Introduction  3D Cranio-Facial Reconstruction \(CFR\is a simulation technology that employs computer graphics to reconstruct facial models and it is founded on the sciences of forensic medicine, anthropology and anatomy. 3D CFR is a hot researching topic due to its broad applicability, for example, criminal cases require CFR technology for victim authentication. Numerous research groups in universities and research institutes 
have pursued CFR research e.g. University of Washington, Sheffield University, and Waseda University. However one of the major problems in reconstructing facial models is to do so with high efficiency for achieving a high level of realism 1  2 3   This paper proposes a novel CFR approach applicable to Chinese people based on feature points Firstly, we scan a skull model and the model holes typically generated by noisy scans - are repaired by building the implicit surface of holes and smoothing the mesh 
4 Secondly, a radial basis function \(RBF deformation method based on feature points is proposed to reconstruct the fa cial model quickly with a high degree of realism. This is essentially a mapping process from a reference facial model to a source skull model, deforming the reference facial model appropriately to generate a face to furnish the skull Thirdly, we use an algorithm for constrained texture mapping to strengthen the visual realism of the reconstruction. Section 2 gives an overview of our approach including the algorithm outline. The key 
steps in our algorithm are described in Section 3. Some experiments and relevant discussion are presented in Section 4. Finally Section 5 presents conclusions and outlines possibilities for future developments  2. System Description  2.1. System Overview  Our 3D CFR contains three stages. In the preliminary step, a ref erence facial model is extracted by iso-surfacing 5  from a set of Computer Tomography CT\ scans, and the source 3D skull mesh model is 
obtained with a 3D las er scanner. Typically the skull mesh model contains holes due to e.g. noisy scans or standard long-term dama ge \(especially in the soft-bone area around the nose we repair such holes using standard four-step repairin g technology, but we present novel advancing layer-wise solu tion for big holes and template model matching for specific hole e.g. nose Secondly, feature points are ma rked on the skull model in order to reconstruct the face surface model and we use a global and a local deformation for the reconstruction. The form er guarantees consistency among the reference facial model and the source skull 
mode. The latter allows us to obtain detailed facial model information. Finally, texture mapping is employed to strengthen visual realism. The details of our approachs, e.g. hole repairing, facial reconstruction based on feature points wo uld be introduced in the following sections  2.2. Hole repairing  _______________ ______________ 978-1-4244-3701-6/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE 


The holes are repaired to guarantee the consistency of resource model and reference model Figure 1  shows our algorithm process. For the standard hole, we employ the standard Four-stage Hole-Repairing Algorithm\(FHRA\. For holes in 3D Human skull are various, however, it is hard for us to apply this standard approach to repair some special holes\(big hole or specific area\. An improved algorithm advancing layer-wise solution \(ALS\ased on the standard FHRA method is presented for repairing the big holes , and a novel Template Matching Algorithm TMA\ is introduced for repairing the particular holes suitable for sp ecific areas e.g. nose   Figure 1   The hole-repairing algorithm  1\ Standard Four-s tage Hole-Repairing Algorithm The holes are identified by extracting and sorting points along their boundaries. Then generate all the necessary points for covering the hole area in its entirety. To guarantee the connectivity of the source skull mesh and the insertion points, we then build an implicit surface to represent the hole using a Radial Basis Function \(RBF   7   and the position of insertion points is adjusted by using the Newton Iteration Method 8 Finally a Laplacian operator is applied to smooth the triangul ar mesh surface 9  2\ALS method for the big holes With the above method the insertion points are directly adjusted to implicit surface, however, if the holes are big, it is usually impossible to control the shape with the points aroun d the hole for the implicit surface is usually flat. Th erefore, we first use these points around the hole to get the shape of the adjacent area and generate the implicit surface, we then adjust the insertion points in this implicit surface to generate the new points, finally we repeat these two steps and repair the holes. Th e method, call Advancing Layerwise Solution \(ALS\, is to improve the standard FHRA for large size holes, and guaran tee that all the insertion points and the points around the hole lie in the same implicit surface. The result is shown in Figure 2 b 3\ TMA for repairing specific areas In our experiment, we also find both the standard FHRA repairing and its impr oved algorithm ALS are not suitable for some specific areas, e.g. around the nose, as the relevant anatomical structures exhibit complex shapes that are not fully taken into consideration. We thus propose a novel Template Matching Algorithm \(TMA\, using a template model in order to repair the holes. The algorithm consists of two steps: model matching and mesh fusion. The model matching employs RBF deformation. The template nose model and the hole in the nose area are marked with some control points in pairs. By using these corresponding points as constrained points, the RBF deformation makes the the boundary of template nose model match the hole In mesh fusion, we first take the vertices of the template nose model after model matching as constrain t points, and the RBF implicit surface of the template nose model is then generated. We then adjust th e vertices around the hole of nose area to the impl icit surface. Finally, the vertices of the implicit surface and the vertices around the hole of nose are triangulated using Delaunay Triangulation. The result is shown in Figure 2 c   a\  FHRA            \(b\   ALS            \(c Figure 2 Hole-repairing results using different methods: \(a\is the result using FHRA, \(b\the result of large hole repairing using ALS, \(c\ is result of nose repairing using TMA  2.3. Facial reconstruction with RBF deformation  The CFR is a deformation process from the reference facial model to the source skull model. The reference facial model is deformed to generate the primary features of the source skull model after defining and extracting the feature points under a uniform coordinate system According to standard anatomy, an individual skull feature point is by default matched with a facial feature point. The line connecting a skull and its corresponding facial feature point can be viewed as the normal on a surface mesh; the length of this line represents the soft tissue depth. The facial feature points can be calculated from the marked skull feature points using the rules developed in Lan 1 for Chinese people The problem can be represented as a spatial deformation, the algorith m contains two steps Firstly, the reference facial model is deformed globally to register the ref erence facial model and the 


source skull model. Secondly, the improved RBF 1 12   deformation is implemented according to the network characteristic of RBF 1  Global Deformation The Oriented Bounding Box\(OBB  is applied to global deformation betwe en the reference face model and the resource skull model. Then the method of global coordinate scaling is used to make the registrations in facial features between the both models accurately, consequently, lay the foundation for the local deformation 2  Local Deformation We improved the RBF formulation from      1     N i i i x x h c x F to     1 i n i i p p c p f      1 where i p p  is the Euclidean distance between P  and P i and   i p p   is the radial basis function We add low-order polynomial to the transformation function to represent the global deformation, such as affine transformation, and the transformation function is then changed as the following form t Mp p p c p f i n i i            1 2 where n is the number of feature points c i  3  1 R  is the weights associated with feature points  is the radio symmetric function i p 3  1 R  is the control point 3  3 R M  and 3  1 R t  are the affine transformation, respectively Our CFR approach cons ists of the following three steps by using the above improved RBF r each feature point i the position on the reference facial model is marked by P i and the position of facial feature point associated with skull feature point on the source skull model is marked by q i  q i is calculated by q i s i d i where s i is the position of source skull feature point d i is the depth of soft tissue associated with s i  f\(p is a function that maps the p i  to q i  q i f  p i feature points position of the reference model can be obtained from f  p i   q i f  p i e transformation function and f is denoted by a radial basis function which is chosen as formulation \(4 To remove the contribution of affine transformation from the weight ed sum of the RBF, we have the additional constraints       n i T i i n i i p c c 1 1 0  0 3 Let    i i j p p a     n i j 012 012  1 and we can get the matrix equations          015                     015                    015           0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1   2  1 2 1 1 1 2 2 21 1 1 11 n n T n T n nn n n n p p p t M c c c p p p a a p a a p a a              4 After getting the coefficient i c   0 n i 012 012 of RBF and affine components of M and t, the source facial model is generated by transforming each mesh vertex of the reference facial model in the volume spanned by the feature points accordi ng to formulation \(2\e are some functions that can be chosen for RBF, such as the Gauss function 2     c r e r    the reverse squareroot function 2 1 2 2         c r r and the thin-plate spline r r r k ln   2   In our experiments, we have used the Gauss function as the RBF and c = 64  3. Experiments Results and Discussion  Our algorithms have been implemented under VC and the Visualization toolkit  and source skull data obtained from a hosp ital. The experimental environment is Pentium IV with 1.83 GHz main frequency of CPU and 1.5GB memory   According to the shape characteristics of the skull and the structure of facial model, we use RBF deformation to reconstruct the face model. After marking 36 feature points on the source skull model and the reference facial model, the reference facial model is deformed to get a realistic facial model which matches the source skull model under the control of these feature points The result is shown in Figure 3 a\. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm we use another 3D skull model to transform the same reference facial model see Figure 3 b\, and the result is also realistic. Finally we use the constrained texture mapping method to improve the visual realism of the reconstructed facial models. This method is to find a mapping function that maps each \(x,y,z\int on the mesh to the point  u,v of the texture image  We first mark the constrained points on the texture image, then employ an interpolating Radial Basis Function \(RBF   8  to get the texture coordinate of non-constrained points 


according to the constrained points. See the final result Figure 3 c\ and \(d   Figure 3 The results of our facial reconstruction  4. Conclusions and Future Work  Computer-aided CFR can be used in a variety of fields, such as criminal cases, face-lifting surgery archeology, and realistic facial animation. This paper presents a novel craniofacial reconstruction system based on feature points. It consists of three stages: hole repairing for the 3D skull mo del, facial reconstruction with RBF deformation and finally texture mapping. In the stage of hole repairing, new repairing methods for complex holes of the skull data are proposed ALS for big holes and TMA for particular area; In the phase of facial reconstruction, we improve the RBF deformation for face model reconstruction from the skull meshes Finally we optimize the constrained texture mapping for the realistic face model. Our approach is validated for Chinese people and this depends on the relationship between the facial feature points of the source skull model and the skull. The experimental results demonstrate the high r ealism of the method In the future, we will red uce the error propagation by introducing an extra pr ocessing stage in our method and also work on adapting our techniques so that for specific areas \(e.g. eye and mouth\reated differently by the matching algorithm  Acknowledgements  This work was partly supported by the National Natural Foundation of Chin a \(NSFC\ under grant No. 60703002, Zhejiang Provincial National Natural Foundation project under grant No. Y1080383 and Y106371, and key project from Science and Technology Department of Zhejiang Province under grant No.2007C11022  References   Gree f SD, W i llems G Thre e dimens ional craniofa cial reconstruction in forensic identification.

This work has relied on historical data for training purposes, and the historical data has generally not contained enough examples of faults to adequately train a supervised learning algorithm such as C4.5. The work described in this paper is diffe rent in that we now have a high-fidelity simulator \(the DRTM\at can provide training data for many different fault cases, which has enabled us to use a supervised learning approach Martin et al present s a com p ari s on of si x unsupervi s ed anomaly detection algorithms. They ran all six algorithms using Space Shuttle Main Engine data from four space shuttle flights and two test stand firings for training, and eight shuttle flights and four test stand firings for validation Although they acknowledge that they do not have enough data to make statistically significant comparisons of the relative performance of the six algorithms, they conclude that the algorithm with the be st accuracy appeared to be eith or t h e one-cl a ss Support Vect or M achi n e depending on how they classify ground truth in the validation data Park et al appl i e d t h e B E AM B eacon-based Exception Analysis for Multi-Missions\ to anomaly detection in SSME data. BEAM has nine components that use nine different approaches to anomaly detection including both supervised and unsupervised approaches The work reported in the referenced paper only used one of the nine components: the Dynamical Invariant Anomaly Detector \(DIAD\ch is an unsupervised anomaly    5

It detected all of the major failures in these seven tests, although it missed some minor failures and had some false alarms  descri bes an unsupervi s ed anom al y  detection algorithm known as the Inductive Monitoring System \(IMS\and its use in a Space Shuttle application After the STS-107 Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, Iverson applied IMS to data from four temperature sensors inside the Shuttle\222s wings. He trained it using data from five previous Space Shuttle flights, and then tested it using STS107 data. It detected an anomaly in data from the temperature sensors on the Shuttle\222s left wing shortly after the foam impact, suggesting in retrospect that with the aid of IMS, flight controllers might have been able to detect the damage to the wing much sooner than they did. More recently, IMS has been deploy ed to the Mission Control Center at NASA Johnson Space Center, where it is being used to monitor live data from the International Space Station Srivasta descri bes a sy st em  t h at  perform s unsupervised anomaly detection in sequences of discrete data using envelope detecti on methods and dynamic Hidden Markov Models. This system has been applied to data from the switches in an aircraft cockpit. In this application, it detects anomalies in the sequence of switch flips made by the pilot, including detecting if the switches are flipped in an unusual order. For example, it can detect if the pilot lowers and raises the landing gear multiple times, instead of just once \(as is usually the case in the training data Many of the existing approaches to supervised learning for systems health monitoring have used artificial neural networks to model the system. Artificial neural networks are a type of nonlinear model based loosely on the neural structure of the brain, in which the weights of the connections among neurons are automatically adjusted to maximize the fit of the model to the training data Guo and Mu appl i e d neural net w orks t o sensor validation for the SSME. He and Shi found t h at support  vector machines produced be tter accuracy than artificial neural networks when applied to a pump diagnosis problem One disadvantage of neural network approaches is that most humans are unable to understand or interpret the neural network models. Support vector machines suffer from similar lack of comprehensibility, but models based on decision trees are generally easier to understand, and therefore more likely to be accepted by human experts 8  C ONCLUSIONS  High-fidelity simulated J-2X data was used to train a decision tree for fault detection and fault isolation. Testing the tree on a separate set of simulated data showed that the tree has very low false alarm rates. It has very low missed detection rates for leaks of size 0.1 square inches or larger at four of the five locations, and adequate missed detection rates for leaks of size 0.2 square inches or larger at the fifth location. The tree almost always correctly isolates leaks of size 0.1 square inches or larger for three of the five locations, but tends to confuse the remaining two locations The decision tree described here was delivered to SSC for integration with G2 at Test Stand A-1 A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  We thank Chuong Luu and Hagop Panossian of Pratt Whitney Rocketdyne for their help with the DRTM.
