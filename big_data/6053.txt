In order to solve this problem, we present a proposal of healthy eating analyzing and recommender system based on web data mining, which would track your eating habit and recommend the types of foods that improve your health and avoid the types of foods that raise your risk for illnesses. In this paper, we first introduce some basic knowledge of web data mining. Then a web-based data mining solution to healthy eating analyzing and recommender system is brought up. Finally we post the system implementation proposal for this system Keywords-web data mining; healthy eating; recommender system I.  INTRODUCTION With the pace of life gradually accelerated nowadays people seem too busy to pay much attention to their eating Therefore fast-food becomes more and more popular in daily life, which would lead unhealthy eating habit. To resolve this contradiction, we resort to the new web technique: web data mining [1 Web data mining aims to discover useful information and knowledge from the web hyperlink structure, page contents and usage data. Here we present a proposal of healthy eating system based on web data mining, which would track your eating habit and recommend the types of foods that improve your health and avoid the types of foods that raise your risk for illnesses. Jinhua Sun and Yanqi Xie introduce a web data mining solution to e-commerce to discover hidden patterns and business strategies from their customer and web data propose a new framework based on data mining technology for building a Web-page recommender system [2], which would be used as the basic framework for healthy eating 


system In our proposal, this system consists of three correlative procedures: eating habit data acquisition, data mining process and healthy eating recommendation. We suppose that there is a website where people could take their orders over the internet just like that in the restaurant. We acquire people eating habit data in the database which could track peoples recipe record. Also people could directly input their eating data into the database through the website. Then we use mining algorithm like classification, association rules in the data mining process to extract the useful information of peoples eating habit. Finally we give out personalized recommendation for each individual II. WEB DATA MINING The characteristics of web data determine the immense challenge for effective data mining. According to the characteristics of web data and combining the general process of data mining, the web data mining process can be described as the five functional modules [3], namely the data acquisition, data pre-processing, data mining, analysis and evaluation and knowledge formulation modules. The functions of each module are shown as Figure 1  A. Data acquisition Generally speaking, in terms of functionality, data acquisition module selectively obtains data from the outside web environment to provide material and resources for the latter data mining. The data source that the web environment provided includes the web pages data, hyperlinks data and the history data of user visiting log. This module is composed by three relatively independent processes which are data search, data selection and data collection B. Data preprocessing Data preprocessing mainly processes and reconstructs the source data acquired in data acquisition phase and builds the data warehouse of related themes to create basic platform for data mining process. Data preprocessing is preparation for Data Acquisition Data Preprocessing Data Mining Knowledge Formulation Analysis

Data mining Data mining module is the core of the whole system Data mining is the process of extracting patterns from data which is becoming an increasingly important tool to transform this data into information. It is commonly used in a wide range of profiling practices, such as marketing surveillance, fraud detection and scientific discovery Generally speaking, the ultimate goals of data mining only are description and prediction, the so-called description is that using a comprehensible model to express the attributes and characteristics information contained in the data; and the prediction is to find the discipline of the attributes according to their existing data value and then speculate a possible attribute value in the future. Classical data mining techniques include classification of users, finding associations between different product items or customer behavior, and clustering of users [4 1 groups. For example, an email program might attempt to classify an email as legitimate or spam. Common algorithms include decision tree learning, nearest neighbor, naive Bayesian classification and neural networks 2 predefined, so the algorithm will try to group similar items together 3 the data with the least error 4 between variables. For example a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits. Using association rule learning, the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes. This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis 


D. Analysis and evaluation Analysis and evaluation module is to analyze the credibility and effectiveness of the knowledge model the data mining obtained, and to educe evaluated conclusions to provide information support for the management and decision-making of users E. Knowledge formulation Knowledge expression module refers to the knowledge models mined from the web data by using data mining tools and it will be shown with appropriate form to facilitate user acceptance and mutual exchange III. DESIGN OF HEALTHY EATING SYSTEM A. Function Description In our proposal, the system is composed by three parts eating data acquisition, data mining process and healthy recommendation. The system function description is as shown in figure 2 1 where people could take their orders over the internet just like that in the restaurant. We acquire people eating data in the database which could track peoples recipe record. Also people could directly input their eating data into the database through the website The eating data acquired through the website is the firsthand material for this system, e.g. the eating time, food name amount, material, etc. All these related items are shown as the first step in figure 2 2 classification, clustering, association rules, etc. in the data mining process to extract the useful information of peoples eating habit. First, we analyze the nutritive structure of each kind of food and calculate how much fat, energy, vitamin you have in your recipe. Then we use the classification mining algorithm to process the composition data and give out the result whether your diet is healthy or not 3 mining process in last step, we could get much useful information. For example what you lack, what you have too much, the potential disease, etc.. Then we could recommend the healthy recipe, group of dishes, tips, etc. according to the personal condition. The recommendations by our recommender system would improve your trophic structure 


and raise your health standards. On the other hand, we also track clients individual preferences. This system could 1. Eating data Time Food Name Amount Food Material  2. Result How much fat How much energy What you need Healthy or not  3. Recommendation Recipe Group of dishes Potential disease Healthy tips  Figure 2.  System function description 347 recommend the related dishes to fulfill personalized need by using association rules mining. Therefore it would provide better service and experience for clients B. Healthy Eating System The healthy eating system architecture consists of four parts: the integration layer, the data layer, the recommendation engine layer and the user interface. The basic framework of the recommender system is described in 2]. The system architecture is shown in figure 3 1 data for further processing. For instance: extraction cleaning, transformation and loading. This layer uses XQuery, XSLT and XML Schemas to feed the data repository, i.e., relational or XML native database. The web log parser component is used to parse and transform plain ASCII files produced by a web server to a standard database format This layer is used to tie the instances of web services and web pages to sessions and users. It is important to investigate the usage of the web services composition used through 


users sessions   2 It also stores pre-processed logs, e-commerce sessions, and information about the web services execution 3 engine and is in charge of bulk loading XML data from database, executing SQL commands against it and executes the mining algorithms. These algorithms could involve a simple classification of the users recipe in the database and could also find the association between users diet composition and some potential diseases. Then according to these relations we could recommend different groups of dishes, which would be better for peoples health We adopt decision tree algorithm to analyze clients recipes data and give out their healthy situation. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable based on several input variables. Here the attribute set is showed as a vector X=\(X1, X2, X3 , Xk for different attributes such as fat, protein, sugar, vitamin minerals amount, etc., which are extracted from history data of clients diet. The classification attribute set C=\(c1, c2 c3, , cn stand for different health situations. We use decision tree as the classifier to realize the mapping function Cf\(X which could be constructed by the prior knowledge of scientific nutritive structure For the recommender system association rule learning would be effective. The original definition of association rule mining is described in [5]. For example, the rule beef}potatoes}{onions, ?  found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, he or she is likely to also buy beef According with this theory, we could process clients history data to find out their preferences. Then the system could recommend the related dishes to clients, which would enhance the quality of personalized service 4 the interface between client and web server. Users could Post Submit

At the same time users could get the recommendation for healthy eating from the server IV. IMPLEMENTATION PROPOSAL In this system, a website as the raw data source should be implemented, which is also used as an e-commerce platform for clients. This website should realize the following functions as shown in figure 4  A. E-commerce platform The first problem we meet in constructing this system is how to acquire the firsthand users recipe data. To solve this realistic problem, a consumer-to-consumer e-commerce platform is needed, e.g. taobao.com. This C2C ecommerce platform would connect the buyers and sellers over the internet, which would create the opportunity to acquire the 


raw data of users The e-commerce web site should let their clients take orders over the internet just like that in the restaurant. Then the web server could send clients orders for food to the restaurants and later clients could have their meals in the booked restaurant B. User interface If Users dont take orders over the internet and they just want to input what they have during a day, the web site should fulfill this requirement C.  Log information The web site should take down the log information of users action over the browser. These data could be used as data resource for data mining D. Data processing in background Data processing engine is an indispensable part of this web site. First, the web server should collect users diets data through the database and history log. Then the firsthand data should be handled by special data mining algorithms which could give out the evaluated results and recommended suggestions V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we present a proposal of healthy eating system based on web data mining. In our proposal, we would cut this system into three parts: eating habit data acquisition data mining process and healthy eating recommendation. We suppose that there is a website where people could take their orders over the internet just like that in the restaurant. We acquire people eating habit data in the database which could track peoples recipe record. Also people could input their eating data into the database through the website. Then we use mining algorithms like clustering, association rules in the data mining process to extract the useful information of peoples eating habit. Finally we give out personalized recommendations for each person The proposal in this paper is just the first step of healthy eating system.

Our scheme eliminates all redundant rules in the sense of [25, 31], i.e. those association rules that are not in the covers. All the meta-rule deductive schemes implicitly included in [25] and [31] are induced by our method. The percentage of pruning, thus, outperforms [25

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
