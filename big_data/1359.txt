Still, there has been\nlittle work in the context of clusters. Using only a single machine\nposes several restrictions: Processing power and data volume are\nbounded to the number of cores and main memory ?tting on\none tightly coupled system. To enable the processing of larger\ndata sets, switching to a cluster becomes necessary.

INTRODUCTION\nToday, main memory column-stores are widely used for the\nef?cient execution of analytical queries and lead to signi?cant\nperformance advantages [1]. While the performance of the\ndatabase systems increases, challenges increase too as users\nalways want lower query response times and process bigger\ndata. There are two approaches to improve performance and\ndata size [2]:\n scale-up: improve the power of a single machine\n• scale-out: use multiple connected machines\nWhile improving the power of a single machine is usually\nlimited, using a cluster can be a very ef?cient solution at a\ncompetetive price. To create a truly scalable cluster system,\nwe need to remove all potential bottlenecks Therefore we\nconcentrate on a shared nothing system as even a shared-disk\nimplementation could introduce a new bottleneck.\nIn this work, we explore with which techniques and al-\ngorithms we can achieve maximal performance for executing\nanalytical SQL queries in a distributed database cluster. In\nparticular, we want to combine all major techniques relevant\nfor performance in one system to make maximal use of the\navailable hardware. Aiming for a shared-nothing system, we\nwant to support large amounts of data that ?t into the overall\nmain memory of the cluster system. Using a subset of the\nanalytical queries of the TPC-H benchmark, we study the most\nef?cient way for execution with the available hardware, trying\nto reach a new lower performance baseline We contribute a\nperformance study that includes a distributed implementation\nevaluated in a networked cluster with up to 128 nodes. While\nanalyzing optimization possibilities for these TPC-H queries in\ndetail, we are looking for solutions to systematically apply our\noptimizations and communication patterns on arbitrary queries.\nAt the end, we compare our implementation with the current\nof?cial TPC-H record holders.\nIn order to make full use of the available hardware in our\ncluster, we combine the following principles:\n• ef?cient single core data processing\n• full parallelization on a single machine\n• ef?cient distributed execution and communication\nOur query processing techniques on a single machine are\nbased on our previous work in [3]. We translate the whole\nexecution plan into a single function performing the query\nwith several threads in a data parallel way. In this work,\nwe perform the translation of SQL to C code manually for\nour experiments Nevertheless, we have already results on an\nautomatic translation from SQL to C with execution times\nsimilar to the manually crafted code and compilation times in\nthe range of centiseconds. Compiling several operators into one\nfunction is also applied by other database systems \(e.g., HyPer\n[4 operators into one function\nallows minimizing intermediate results and often the execution\nof a query in one single pass. The processed tuples are handed\nfrom operator to operator in cache, often even in registers,\nresulting in very ef?cient code.\nNote that distributed query execution usually increases\nthe number of query passes. Additional communication steps\nduring query execution are required to request data or to ship\ndata to a remote node for further processing because in a\nshared-nothing environment, related data resides often on a\ndifferent node. Most techniques for distributed query execution\nare orthogonal to the local query execution model. Hence,\nthese techniques can also be applied in different execution\nmodels.\nExchanging data between nodes in a cluster requires ef?-\ncient inter-node communication. We propose to use message\npassing between the nodes for query execution, giving us a\nhigher level of abstraction than simple point-to-point com-\nmunication. The Message Passing Interface standard \(MPI Conference on Big Data\n978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 518\n[5] provides advanced collective operations like gather, \(per-\nsonalized scalable communication between all nodes\nin the network. Relying only on point-to-point communication\ncould 


easily introduce communication bottlenecks as scalable\ncommunication algorithms are often non-trivial. The possibil-\nity of adding custom data types and reduction functions to the\nMPI operators further improves performance.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. First, we discuss\nrelated work. Second, we engineer ef?cient solutions to reduce\ncommunication costs. Third, we discuss our methods in the\ncontext of the TPC-H benchmark. Next, we evaluate our\nimplementation experimentally. Finally, we summarize the key\nresults of our work and sketch possible future research.\nII. RELATED WORK\nEarly work on cluster query execution for OLAP queries\nstems from DeWitt et al. [6] analyzing parallel database\nsystems in a shared nothing environment running on disk\nwithout multi-threading having very low performance numbers\ncompared to today’s systems. More recent work is from Akal\net al. [7] implementing a database cluster by introducing a\nmiddleware for coordination of single cluster nodes without a\ndeep integration into the database system itself. Their through-\nput experiments on 64 nodes have similar query times than\nour implementation, but with a factor of 10 000 less data. The\nwork of Akal is further re?ned by Lima et al. [8], [9] by\nimproving load balancing between the nodes and sometimes\nusing indexes instead of scans. Still, the overall performance\nproblem remains and using data replication hinders from\nprocessing large data sets.\nThe mentioned solutions do not apply more advanced\ncommunication patterns, but it has been shown by Chockler et\nal. [10] that this is required to leverage the full performance\nof the system. Eavis et al. [11] developed the prototype Sidera\nwhich is based on message passing and targets online analyti-\ncal processing. Neither the synthetic data, nor the benchmark\nqueries were speci?ed in detail, but performance numbers are\nin the range of seconds for processing an input data set of 1\nmillion rows on 16 nodes. Again, our system achieves similar\nruntimes with the same number of nodes processing about\n10 000 times more data using complicated TPC-H benchmark\nqueries.\nThe methods for generating the execution plan and com-\npiling it into single functions is based on our previous work\nin 3]. While in [3] the whole query usually ?ts into a single\nfunction that produces the result, the execution plans in this\nwork consist of several passes and communication steps with\nother nodes during the execution The implementation in [3] is\nlimited to a single machine and performs TPC-H experiments\nup to 300 gigabyte of data, which cannot be signi?cantly\nincreased without moving to a cluster. Neumann [12], Krikellas\net al. [13 present a general approach to generate native\ncode dynamically for incoming SQL queries. For now, we\nwrite the execution plan for each query manually for our\ncluster implementation. Note that we already have ?rst results\non automatically translating an SQL query to C code and\ncompiling it into native code with compile times in the range\nof centiseconds.\nOrders\nSF ? 1.5M\nCustomer\nSF ? 0.15M\nLineitem\nSF ? 6M\nNation\n25 replicated replicated one-to-many one-to-many EXECUTION\nIn this section we present our general approach for dis-\ntributed query execution in a shared-nothing environment\nwhere all nodes are identical and none plays a special role.\nWe consider these assumptions important for scalability. The\nnext section describes the data distribution of our system After\nthat we present several classes for systematic and ef?cient\nquery execution in the distributed environment. Finally, several\noptimization examples follow.\nA. Data Distribution\nTo support full scalability and large database sizes, we\nneed to minimize replicated data and maximize the usage\nof the available main memory. In general, we distribute all\ntables by partitioning them across the nodes. Only in extreme\ncases where a table has a small constant size, we replicate\nthe table across all nodes. As a result, each node holds 1/P\nof the tuples of each distributed table, where P is the number\nof nodes. There are three basic partitioning strategies: range-\nbased, round-robin and hashing [14]. We use range-based\npartitioning, which is suf?cient for synthetic data like in the\nTPC-H benchmark and also simpli?es data generation. We\nalso use co-partitioning [15], i.e., for two tables with closely\nrelated tuples de?ned by a foreign key relation, we store\ncorresponding tuples in partitions on the same node. With this,\nequi-joins on the foreign key relation can be evaluated locally\nand additional communication is avoided. In our experiments\nwith the database benchmark TPC-H, for example, we use co-\npartitioning for the tables lineitem and orders and for part and\npartsupp. See a detailed TPC-H table schema in Fig. 1. The\nschema is extended by a data locality property for foreign key\nrelations. Dashed edges show remote access joins and indicate\nthat the joined tuples can be located in a different partition.\nJoins on solid edges can be performed locally.\nIn general, range partitioning can lead to load imbalances,\ne.g., if a ?lter predicate quali?es only tuples within a single\nrange of the partitioning key. In a productive system we\nwould, therefore, rather use hash based partitioning to obtain\na reasonable load balance for arbitrary access patterns. With\nsmall modi?cations, the concepts used here also apply to other\npartitioning strategies.\nB. Ef?cient Solutions for Data Exchange\nWe now present ways to reduce the communication effort,\nespecially for remote join paths. After a brief discussion 


of\n519\ngeneral techniques, we develop more specialized solutions,\ne.g., by improving ?lters on remote attributes, and by exchang-\ning bit-reduced, estimated values.\n1 a general\nsolution for drastically decreasing communication times if\na lot of intermediate data needs to be exchanged between\nnodes. It has, therefore, an in?uence to the sequential part\nof the algorithm. If the data is sorted, delta compression\nin combination with run length coding, or Golomb coding\nserves well for considerable space reduction. For the non-\nsorted case, compression algorithms like LZ4 can be applied.\nIn terms of \(de data\nthroughput and decreases the footprint of compression. For\nthe implementation of TPC-H, we developed speci?c solutions\nthat lead to compressed message sizes.\n2 specialized\nsolution for the case that the query graph contains a remote\njoin path and the referenced remote attribute is ?ltered \(e.g.\n“WHERE x.nation=[nation]”, with x as a remote relation remote would\nbe to collect all keys that are required by the join, request them\nto the remote node, select quali?ed rows for the join partner\nand return the result to the sender. In the case that O\(|T T :\nremote table elements need to be accessed, we propose a more\nsophisticated solution. Our main idea here is to apply a semi-\njoin reduction by ?ltering the remote attribute \(join column bitset. Afterwards, the\ncomplete bitset is replicated over all nodes \(e.g., using the\nMPI operation all gather size of the remote attributes, on which the ?lter operates.\nSince we materialize the ?lter result for each element, our\nsolution requires |T | bit additional space on each node. In\nterms of the bitset materialization the remote input set can\nbe evaluated by using thread-parallelism, which scales linearly\nwith the number of cores and is limited mostly by the memory\nbandwidth.\n3 prominent\npattern of decision support queries is aggregating values by\nkey and returning only the top-k results. In a cluster, when\nthe values are spread across the nodes and not partitioned\nby key, each node only has a partial aggregate of each key.\nThe complete aggregate of each key is found by aggregating\nthe partial results from all nodes. One na?¨ve solution for this\nproblem is to compute all complete aggregate results from\nthe partial results and determine the top-k results afterwards.\nHowever, in the case of many keys and small k, the communi-\ncation overhead for this operation can be very high compared\nto the ?nal result size There has been a lot of previous\nwork for solving this problem ef?ciently, for example, the\nthreshold algorithm by Fagin et al. [16] or TPUT by Cao et al.\n[17]. Unfortunately, these algorithms do not perform well with\naggregation function SUM if we have the same independent\nvalue distribution of the partial sums across the nodes. In this\ncase, the ?nal aggregated sums follow a normal distribution\nand both algorithms communicate almost all partial sums\nbefore selecting the top-k.\nFor this situation we propose a new distributed algorithm\nthat communicates only several bits of all partial sums. Full\nvalues are only communicated for a small set of top-k candi-\ndates. A detailed description of the algorithm follows.\nIn the ?rst step, we approximate each partial sum by only\nm bits of the number. To skip leading zeros, the m bits\nbegin at an offset which is shared by a group of keys \(e.g.,\n1024 one-\nbit of all numbers within the group. These m bits are only an\napproximation of the values as lower bits are missing. Still,\nwe can compute a maximal and minimal error \(all lower bits\nare one and zero respectively personalized\nall-to-all message such that each node receives all encoded\nsums for its key-range. We further compute a lower and upper\nbound for each decoded partial sum and sum them up by key,\nresulting in an upper and lower bound for the total sum per\nkey. A collective reduce operation determines the global k-th\nhighest lower bound. Each key with an upper bound below the\nk-th highest lower bound cannot be part of the top-k results\nanymore and is, therefore, discarded. After that, each node\nrequests the full partial sums for its remaining keys, which is\nexpected to be a small set. In a ?nal step, the k-th highest total\nsums are determined across the nodes.\nUsing a larger number for the number of bits m increases\nthe message size in the rst step but also improves the lower\nand upper bound afterwards. In our experiments, we applied\nthis algorithm in query 15 of the TPC-H benchmark reducing\nthe communicated data volume by a factor of 8 compared to\nthe na?¨ve solution \(see Section V-C1 only of a small number of rows as the answer should\nremain human-readable. Actually, this is true for all 22 query\nresults of the TPC-H benchmark and usually achieved by\nsmall group-by cardinalities or selecting only the top k results.\nConsequently, we delay the gathering of secondary attributes\nin the result set that are not involved in the actual query\ncomputation \(e.g. in TPC-H query 15: s name, s address,\ns phone 


secondary attributes do not slow\ndown the main query computation. When the ?nal result is\ncollected on a single node, we can request the attributes by\none collective scatter operator and receive them by a collective\ngather operation both in O\(logP TPC-H\nA. TPC-H\nThe TPC-H benchmark is used to measure the performance\nof database systems for decision support OLAP   correctness. We do not change the\nordering of the rows in the tables. Each table is split into P\n\(number of nodes parameters: -s ?SF ? -S ?rank? -C ?P ?. Only the tables\nNATION and REGION with both at most 25 rows are not split\nand replicated across all nodes. We implemented 6 out of 22\nTPC-H queries covering several aspects like ltering, small\nand large aggregations and different join types. Section IV-C\ngives a detailed description of the queries.\n520\nTo allow fair comparison with other systems, we comply\nwith the of?cial TPC-H rules as far as possible. In particular,\nwe follow the rules for sorting relations, data structures,\nand join indexes, which are created transparently between all\nforeign keys. Still, we do not provide the full functionality of\na DBMS We do not support ACID, updates, and the execution\nof arbitrary SQL statements. See the discussion on future work\nin Section VI-B for more details.\nB. Parallelization\nWe used a hybrid parallelization approach for the imple-\nmentation combining inter-node and intra-node parallelism.\nFor the inter-node parallelism we use the open standard\nMPI \(message passing interface data exchange [5]. Our\nMPI implementation is Open MPI [20], an open source imple-\nmentation of the MPI speci?cation. The collective operations\nused by our algorithms are gather \(collecting a message\nfrom each node at root send a message to each\nnode from root every node exchanges a message\nwith every node every node has a message, all\nmessages are the same size, and an operator is applied when\njoining two messages aggregation as well as\ncustomized MPI data types.\nBesides MPI, intra-node parallelism based on shared-\nmemory is realized by using TBB \(Intel Threading Building\nBlocks abstrac-\ntion of thread management [21]. In general we apply data-\nparallelism and logically partition the input into several parts\nfor processing using “parallel for” and “parallel reduce” of\nthe TBB framework providing work stealing and load balanc-\ning between the threads. This way we take full advantage of\nthe available intra-node parallelism.\nC. The Implemented Queries\nWe selected queries 1, 3, 4, 15, 18 and 21 from the 22\nTPC-H queries with the objective to cover various challenges\nand access patterns for distributed execution. Query 1 performs\na large aggregation and accesses only a single table, providing\nthe top ten unshipped orders based on the potential revenue\nper order. It is the most used query in related work. Query 4\nrefers to two co-partitioned tables. It counts per order priority\n\(5 distinct values which contain delayed\nlineitems to estimate the quality of the order priority system.\nQuery 18 also uses two co-partitioned tables but also accesses\nremote attributes for the result output. It determines the top-\n100 customers based on the property of having placed a large\nquantity order. The remaining queries have signi?cant remote\ndata dependencies, which means that join partners can be\nstored on a different partition. Query 3 uses two fact tables and\none remote attribute as ?lter to provide the top ten unshipped\norders based on the potential revenue per order. We resolve the\nremote dependency using the solution of Section III-B2, where\na lter is evaluated on a join attribute to qualify customers by\ntheir market segment. Query 15 uses one fact table and remote\nattributes for result output. It produces a large intermediate\nset of partial results grouped by a remote key selection algorithm with value approximation \(see\nSection III-B3 21\nis similar to query 15 but additionally applies a remote ?lter\nduring aggregation. It lists those suppliers of a speci?ed nation\nwho were part of a multisupplier order where they were the\nonly supplier delaying the order.\nV. EVALUATION\nIn this section, we evaluate the combination of a clustered\nquery execution using message passing for the inter-node\ncommunication, with shared-memory parallelism on each node\nand highly optimized algorithms. In this context, all tables\n\(except extremely small tables with ? 50 rows without table replication. For query 3 and 21,\nwe also evaluate the behavior if the remote join attribute is\nreplicated.\nA. Methodology\nWe measure the running time and scalability of the\nimplemented queries to evaluate our contribution. In this\ncontext, weakly scaled factors are used to linearly scale up the\ninput size with the number of computation nodes [22]. This\napproach simulates the case of an end user who wants to run\ndistributed queries on a growing database. The con?gurations\nfor {#nodes, scale factor} were {2i; 100 2i} for i = 0..7.\nWe brie?y introduce the technical method that was used in\nthe implemented prototype for measuring the experiments.\nAt ?rst, we synchronized the nodes with a barrier before\neach query run. Second, we 


measured the walltime for the\ncomplete query execution. The walltime is used because\ncommunication times are hidden from the local CPU time\n[23] but should be considered in the measures. Third, in order\nto get an accumulated communication time per query, we also\ntracked the running time of occurring MPI communication\noperations. In detail, the walltime values of each node were\naggregated on the root node to determine the mean running\ntime over all nodes. Additionally, speci?c checkpoints were\ntracked by using the CPU time. Those detailed measures allow\nthe evaluation of shared-memory parallelism on multi-cores.\nB Experimental Setup\nFor our experiments we used the high performance cluster\nInstitutsCluster II \(IC2 Karlsruhe Institute of Tech-\nnology \(KIT run shared-nothing parallel programs on up\nto 128 exclusive nodes per user. The IC2 is con?gured with\nan In?niBand 4X QDR for interconnecting the 16-core Intel\nXeon nodes with 64GB main memory per node Moreover,\neach node consists of two E5-2670 Intel Xeon octa-cores\nwith 2.6GHz, 8 × 256KB L2, 20MB L3 According to the\nmanual, the point-to-point network bandwidth is more than\n3 700MB/s with a latency about 1ms We run microbench-\nmarks to measure the real throughput, \(a between two nodes 3 480MB/s b between 2 ? 8 nodes ? 3 000MB/s,\nP ? 16 :< 2 400MB/s in Open MPI v1.6.3 because we used only collective operations for\ninter-node synchronization, such as all-to-all. The cluster thin\nnodes of Nodes \(P  repl repl SF 100 · P  SLES compiled our\nimplementation with GCC 4.7.2 \(optimization level -O3 library.\nC. Experiments\nThe results of our ?rst experiment are presented in Fig. 2,\nwhich contains the plotted running times for weakly scaled\nfactors.\nQueries 1, 4 and 18 only require data during the aggrega-\ntion which are available on the node’s partition. In this context,\nwe expected a constant running time in the weak scaling\nexperiment. As evident from Fig. 2, the running times were\nnearly constant. The maximum scale factor of the experiment\nwas 12, 800 on 128 nodes. In the experiment, the queries 4\nand 18 required around 80?130ms whereas query 1 requires\n? 270ms for execution.\nThe main challenge for queries with join paths to tuples\non a non-local partition \(queries 3, 15, 21 communications\nrepresent an inherent sequential part of the query execution\nand moreover, the message sizes depend on the scale factor.\nTherefore, it is required to keep them small enough to gain\ngood scale up characteristics in order to increase the number\nof nodes \(P demands.\nThe running times for weakly scaled factors should increase\nfor larger P because of an increased communication effort\nfor joining or redistributing intermediate sub-query results.\nOn the one side, the table sizes grow, on the other side,\nmore nodes take part in the collective communication. In this\ncontext, the communication complexity for an all-to-all MPI\ncommunication \(every node exchanges a message with any\nother node P collect a message from every node at root send a message to every node from root collect a message from every node at root apply an operator\nin each step logP match our expectations.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 2, the running times of query 3, 15\nand 21 \(without replication not\ndouble for a doubled input size and factor two more nodes. For\nexample, the execution of query 15 took four times longer on\n64 nodes than on one node, although the amount of processed\ndata was 64 times higher. The observed increasing running\ntime can be explained with an increasing communication effort\nsince the number of communicated elements doubled for each\nstep on the x-axis.\nFor query 3 and 21, we evaluated a ?lter attribute in the ?rst\nstep within a sub-query. The intermediate result size depends\nlinearly on the scale factor and thus the running time increased.\nIn a second sub-query, the redistributed intermediate results\nwere joined during the actual aggregation. In this context, we\nexpected the increasing running time for query 3 and a part\nof the increased running time for query 21 with growing com-\nmunication costs because of a doubled intermediate result size\nfor a doubled scale factor. We also performed an alternative\nimplementation of query 3 and 21 where we replicated the\nremote join attribute to get rid of the remote dependency. Here,\nthe applied strategy for query 3 resulted in constant running\ntime. We gained this improvement as with the replication only\none collective reduce communication with a ?xed-size result\nset took place to collect the ?nal results.\nIn contrast to query 3, query 21 scaled worse and did\nnot provide constant running times if the join attribute was\nreplicated. This effect can be explained by a second remote de-\npendency, namely the remote group-by key of the aggregation.\nTuples consisting of group-by key and partial aggregate were\nmerged and 


aggregated by using a custom reduce operator. The\nnumber of partial results increased with the scale factor and,\ntherefore, this operation clearly dominated the running time\nfor larger P . We did not apply our top-k for query 21 because\nthe integer words of the partial sums are very small.\n1 the running times\nfor query 15 using our top-k value approximation algorithm.\nBecause of weakly-scaled factors, the number of intermediate\nresults doubles in every step and leads to a growing query\nrunning time We evaluate our algorithm \(see Section III-B3 query 15. We implemented the following variants:\n1 64 bit required for each implementation similar to 1 solution with\napproximated values \(8 bit approximation algorithm\nall-to-all \(Open MPI v1.6.3 send and receive calls\nin addition.

In addition the\nexperiment was run on {1, 2, 4, · · · , 64} nodes with similar\nor better speedups as for 128 nodes. It can be seen, that intra-\nnode parallelism strongly affects running times.

Conclusion\nWe have demonstrated that distributed query execution\nusing message passing in the combination with intra-node\nshared-memory parallelism can be performed very ef?ciently\nin a cluster. We developed several techniques for resolving\nremote data dependency by using ef?cient communication\nalgorithms Moreover, we demonstrated the application of\nour concepts on a subset of TPC-H benchmark queries The\nevaluation showed that we are able to query large amounts\n523\nof data with short response times using a cluster and com-\nbining sophisticated collective operations \(from MPI algorithms. In particular, we ef?ciently\nimplemented clustered SQL query execution with datasets up\nto 30 000GB of uncompressed data in main memory and\nachieved query running times with a factor of one to two\norders of magnitudes faster than the current record holder for\nclustered results in TPC-H on scale factor 10 000 whereas for\nscale factor 30 000 no of?cial clustered results exist until now.\nB. Future Work\nCurrently, the query plans for an SQL query are written\nmanually in C++ with the help of a set of library functions,\ni.e the queries must be formulated with a lower level language\nthan SQL. In order to execute arbitrary SQL statements by\nour system, we require a compiler to automatically translate\nSQL into query plans including functions compiled into native\ncode. We are working on such a compiler and can already\ncompile 13 out of 22 TPC-H queries on a single machine\nwith compile times from SQL to native code in the range\nof centiseconds There are other databases like HyPer [12]\nor DBToaster [28], [29], which have shown that performing\njust-in-time compilation of SQL queries into native code is\npossible. For clustered query execution, we need to extend\nsuch a compiler in order to automatically generate distributed\nplans for a given SQL query.\nFor larger systems with thousands of nodes, fault tolerance\nwill become important because node failures and other errors\nwill be common place. The challenge here is to introduce some\nredundancy without excessive cost.\nNext, we applied range partitioning and co-partitioning\nfor speci?c tables because TPC-H uses synthetic data and\nwe could achieve a good load balance with those strategies.\nNevertheless, there are also adaptive partitioning methods\nlike [30], adjusting the partitioning according to the current\naccess patterns and workload. Finally, we evaluated our\nimplementation by using a high performance cluster with a fast\nIn?niBand network for node interconnection. An application\non commodity hardware with slower networks is also an\ninteresting use case as part of future work.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Franz Fa¨rber, David\nKernet, Norman May, Ingo Mu¨ller and Sebastian Schlag for\nhelpful suggestions and comments.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

This is because the \ntime in preparation may be very low while the time in space \nmay be very long. If the preparation period will be less than \nseveral weeks then sampling frequency should be ncontinuous or as continuous as feasible . If the preparation \nperiod for launch will occur over many weeks then the \nsampling frequency can be reduced to once/hour. \nIn general, the shorter the preparation time for launch the \nhigher the data sampling frequency is required. Preferably, \nprelaunch activity biological diagnostic data should be \nrecorded continuously and the data available for merging \nwith launch and on-orbit data. After a person initially \narrives in space, the sampling frequency should be \ncontinuous or near continuous . After the person has been in \nspace for several weeks, the sampling frequency can be \nreduced to once/hour. If a person is in space for several \nmonths, the sampling frequency can be reduced to as little \nas once/6 hours . \nTable 2.

CONCLUSION \nA prognostic and health management \(PHM industry telemetry to collect, store and distribute \nto remote locations the biological, diagnostic information \nfor process for predicting mental illness using with \npredictive algorithms .  The predictive algorithms are often \nproprietary and must be developed for use with aerospace \ntelemetry to compensate for the many shortcomings and \ncomplexities of CCSDS telemetry to be accurate and \nreliable. Our proprietary predictive algorithms were \npioneered on the Air Force's GPS satellites and Atlas launch \nvehicles over 30 years ago. They have also been \nsuccessfully used on other military, NASA and commercial \nsatellites, launch vehicles and missiles to illustrate the \npresence of accelerated aging in normal appearing \nequipment telemetry from completely normal behaving \nequipment. \nA behavior of a person ' s  FOFR can explain the cause ntreatment and the cure for mental illness .  The chemicals \n1 8  \nreleased by the FOFR when activated were developed by the \nFOFR to be in the body an extremely short duration. \nToday's  lifestyle has forced people to remain in threatening \nsituations forcing the presence of the toxic chemicals used \nby the FOFR for self preservation to be present for many \nyears at varying levels. The chemicals released by the FOFR \nand release of chemicals that are created as a result of the \nrelease of adrenaline and cortisol cause accelerated aging on \nthe entire body including all areas of the brain. When the \nFOFR is damaged from accelerated aging, it forces the \nbrain 's  chemistry to be altered by changing the ratios of \nthree main chemicals very, causing mental illness .  All the \nmedications used in mental health treat only the symptoms \nof mental illness and do not cure it. \nThe identification of accelerated aging in biological, \ndiagnostic telemetry can be used by ground personnel to \npredict the mental illness in personnel to be used for deep \nspace missions. The model of the brain' s  FOFR subsystem \nprovides the information necessary for the ground crew to \npredict and thus prevent mental illness from occurring by \nmaking the changes to the person ' s  environment. The PHM \nuses information obtained from a variety of mission phases \nincluding pre-launch readiness, launch and during deep nspace travel to develop baseline behavior from which \nmental illness can predicted so it can be prevented nREFERENCES \n[ 1 ] .

specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
