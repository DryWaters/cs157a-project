interdependencies between the different \nplanning modules. The establishment of interconnections \nbetween these modules is hereby complicated due to the use of \ndifferent optimization methodologies and tools in the different \nplanning domains. The structure and embedding of different \nplanning modules is depicted in Figure 1. \nFigure 1.  The Layout Planning of a Modular Factory Planning Approach \nThe top of the picture shows a section of the factory \nplanning working chain. It consists of the planning modules \ndescribed earlier. Within the current work, especially the layout \nplanning module is examined. With regard to the layout \nplanning different relevant sources of data can be identified as \nshown in the lower area of Figure 1. Besides the information \nfrom the ERP level, data taken from already existing \nproduction sites, which are referred to as historical data”, as \nwell as data taken from simulation and optimization tools are \nused to perform the layout planning. In order to combine these \ndifferent information into one holistic view, an embedded nplatform has to be carried out that is capable of managing all \ninformation provided. Such shared IT-environment requires an \nintegrative information model as well as a common data basis \nthat supports communicative and administrative support of \nconcurrent simultaneous engineering processes [6]. \nIn order to reach a consistent factory design as described \nabove, the different planning modules have to be linked in nterms of such holistic model. Hence, a common information \nmanagement system is needed, which is capable of integrating \nthe different planning modules into one integrative information \nmodel. Thus, the goal of a holistic factory planning consists in \nthe definition of an information model that contains not only \nthe capabilities to integrate the different modules of the factory \nplanning process, but also to manage the information generated \nand provided by various sources. In order to practically use an \ninformation platform that is capable of these functionalities, a \nsoftware framework will be utilized to integrate the layout nplanning module into the overall factory planning context. The \nframework in use, which is referred to as Adaptive Data \nIntegration using Services \(ADIUS Intelligence \(VPI modules and tools concerning factory planning. \nIn the present work, the state of the art in layout planning nand data integration with the focus on vertical data exchange \nwill be examined in section 2. In order to reach an adaptive \noptimization approach, the planning process of a factory needs \nto be structured in a more flexible way. Thus, a layout planning \napproach, which takes into account multiple scenarios, will be ndescribed in section 3. Accordingly, in section 4, the added \nvalue of such an approach is demonstrated by making use of a \ncomplex planning problem, before first practical results will be \ndemonstrated in section 5 In the use-case, the traditional layout \nplanning process will be extended by taking into account time nconstraints by applying a flexible planning algorithm. \nII. STATE OF THE ART \nA. Layout Planning \nLayout planning represents a central part of the factory \nplanning and has advanced to a core element of production nplanning in the context of functional and production-oriented \nallocation of resources. The optimal allocation of resources can \nbe understood as the material flow-fair assignment. Thus, the \nflow of material serves as a defining criterion for the \noptimization of the production flow. This is mainly due to the \nhigh economic relevance of the material flow costs compared \nto the overall costs of the operating factory [7 nLayout planning of a factory is carried out in several steps \nand is based on planning modules. According to the VDI [8], \nlayout planning is part of the conceptual planning of a factory \nand is carried out by determining the ideal layout first and the \nreal layout afterwards. The derivation of the ideal layout is nhereby comprised of structure planning and the dimensioning \nof resources. Afterwards, the production control, the logistics \nand the information and communication flow are determined in \nterms of the real factory layout. The relevant literature shows a \nwide range of approaches to layout planning [7] [9 nAccording to the current state of the art, the ideal layout is \ninitially designed using existing production data before it is \nadapted to other requirements of the production facilities. Thus, \nthe first step in designing a production structure is to derive \nbasic structures of the production from existing factories or nplanning projects. Existing data or manufacturing information \ncan for instance consist of product lists processes, quantities \nand other variables of the Enterprise Resource Planning. Based \nupon these “historical data”, several possible scenarios of the \nproduction configuration are selected and compared.  \nThe planning of the ideal layout is hereby independent of \nthe variables associated with the design constraints of the real nlayout planning, which takes into account all relevant boundary \nconditions, e.g. architectural or legal restrictions. Thus, the \nideal layout planning determines the production configuration \nonly in terms of an optimized material flow. Numerous \nanalytical, heuristic and graphical methods have been carried \nout in order to support a structured determination of the ideal \nlayout [10]. The considerations of all boundary conditions nhappens in later steps of the planning through the application of \nfurther planning modules in order to 


determine the real layout \n \n \nof the plant [7]. A well-structured summary of the different \napproaches and factors influencing the layout planning process \nis provided by Kampker et al. [11]. \nNevertheless, especially the step from the ideal to the real \nlayout is usually influenced by the knowledge of experts and is ntherefore principally shaped through experience values. \nAccordingly, the main challenge in layout planning is the \nquantitative measurability of various scenarios with the aim to \ndetermine an optimal solution – not at least due to the fact that \nthe approaches to determine the real layout are only \ndocumented in a qualitative and abstract form. Hence, there is a \nlack of explicit instructions in the literature regarding the \ncompliance of conditions such as ensuring the flow of \ncommunication as well as the flexibility and modularity of the \nproduction. Similarly, there are only few quantitative \napproaches for estimating the costs arising from the \nconsideration of all according boundary conditions [11]. \nAt present, an individual evaluation system has to be \ndeveloped for each production planning project. This system is \nnot only based on the conditions of the current project, it also \ntakes into consideration historical planning data. On the basis \nof this rating system, different scenarios are evaluated and \ncompared with each other in order to determine the "optimal" \nfactory layout. The evaluation is either based on qualitative or \non semi-quantitative methods using point evaluation systems, \nwhereas the "ratings" are based on the comparison with \nplanning successes of previous projects. The disadvantages of \nthis approach are the low reproducibility of planning successes \nas well as the low degree of systematization of the planning \nprocess. Due to the uncertainties, which are accompanied using \nthis way of optimizing the layout of the factory, the results nhave to be adaptable and flexible for later modifications. In \norder to evaluate the planning success in each later step of the \nfactory planning and from each level of the manufacturing \nenterprise, a holistic and pervasive vertical data integration \nneeds to be established within the planning processes. \nB. Vertical Data Integration \nOne of the most important approaches concerning the \ncross-linking of different scopes in enterprises has arisen from \nthe Business Intelligence \(BI  interconnect the different departments of a \ncompany from the economic point of view [13]. However, due \nto their data-oriented, enterprise-wide character, BI can also \nserve interconnection functionalities as well as decision support \nwithin a connected environment of production facilities. The \nbasic idea of Business Intelligence is to collect and to process \ninformation in order to gain a deeper understanding of \nprocesses in companies. These intelligence functionalities can \nbe applied either on the economical part of an organization or \nwithin the production environment of the company. \nIn terms of production planning intelligence tools can be \nused for both analyzing historical manufacturing data as well as \nprocessing real-time data taken from the production process. \nAn establishment of cross-sectional data treatment processes in \nthe production environment is necessary to guarantee a \npropagation of information to all people who are involved in \nplanning processes in an appropriate form [13]. \nWith regard to the factory planning domain, intelligence \ntools like BI can support the integration of different tools into \none optimization framework through a consistent information \nmodel. In this context, numerous software solutions exist nproviding an IT support in the planning phase. However, most \nof the existing systems are stand-alone solutions that focus on \none aspect of the planning task and are therefore insufficient \nwith regard to the evaluation of the overall planning process. \nThese tools do not build a monolithic system, so that a nhomogeneous connection of the IT environment will probably \nnot be possible [6]. In order to apply the BI idea on the \ndifferent tools of a manufacturing enterprise, the BI term has to \nbe extended on different fields on the management and on the \nproduction level at the same time. \nIn order to spread this Business Intelligence approach to the \nfield of production, other terms have been introduced such as \nthe operational Business Intelligence \(OpBI CPM Performance Management, which continue the idea of \nBI on new fields of application [14]. Accordingly approaches \nhave been discussed in the current literature that could lead to a \nmerge of intelligence systems from the different levels of a \nmanufacturing enterprise. In this context, a first differentiation \nis made especially between Operational Business Intelligence \n\(OpBI MES concepts have in common that they analyze and \ncoordinate entrepreneurial processes. However, they operate in ndifferent sections of the value chain. OpBI systems provide \nreal-time data analysis through BI technologies like Real-Time \nData Warehousing and Online Analytical Processing \(OLAP models and on functions of sales \nand marketing [15]. MES, however, provide data consolidation \nand monitoring capabilities within the production environment. \nThis is primarily performed through engineering-oriented nconcepts, which are capable of organizing the manufacturing \nprocesses [16]. A flexible planning, which is able to manage \nchanging and unexpected circumstances within production can \nonly be realized through the 


interoperability of OpBI and MES. \nHereby, the data collection and analysis from different levels of \nthe company has to be guaranteed as well as the integration of \nthe according information into a database system 17]. \nAn integrative solution to serve the desired interoperability \nbetween these heterogeneous, distributed systems was shown \nwith the adaptive information integration according to Meisen \net al. [18]. A framework based on this approach allows the \ncreation of an integrative information model in connection with \nthe propagation of data into a common data basis, which \ncontains both input and output data from various applications \nin a structured form [19]. This framework and the according \ninformation model enable an establishment of Business \nIntelligence approaches into the domain of virtual production \nand are referred to as “Virtual Production Intelligence \(VPI INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM \nThe Virtual Production Intelligence allows a merge of \nheterogeneous planning simulation and optimization tools. \nBased on the information model, a platform has been carried \n \n \nout that is capable of integrating information from different \ncorporate processes, production processes and simulations into \none common data basis [19]. This multi-dimensional data basis \nenables – through the integrative methodology of the common \ninformation model – a vertical data flow of information from \nall levels of the production management and operations. \nThis vertical information flow is necessary to enable a full \nmapping of the processes in a manufacturing company. In \norder to guarantee a holistic optimization of production \nprocesses, the flow of information has to be designed especially \nfor simultaneous data propagation and data treatment. These \nfunctionalities are only realizable through methodologies, \nwhich enable an integration of data from different sources into \ncentral data storages. These data can, for instance, consist of \ndata taken from the ERP level or of sensor values taken from \nthe field levels. The merge and the common analysis of these \ndata sets are essential for a sound and well-founded analysis of \nthe processes that can be understood by the experts involved in \nthe planning of the production. The needed interface for the \ninteraction between the user and this system can be realized \nthrough database views that are based on the described \ninformation model. Thus, through a full integration of all \nrelevant information the optimization system is capable of \nproviding all needed information to the user by visualizing the \ndata within diagrams or by showing reports of aggregated data \nsets. According to Vogel-Heuser [20], the goal of connecting \nthe production systems with a distributed IT environment can \nbe reached by integrating an information layer between the \nproduction site and the IT systems \(Figure 2 replaces the interfaces between applications from the \nmanufacturing layer and the information management layers. \n \nFigure 2.  The Information Model Layer for a conected IT environment \nThrough the information model’ capability to interpret data \nfrom the field level of the production, single connections \nbetween the machinery and hardware \(bottom in Figure 2 top in Figure 2 to enable the interpretation of data, the information \nmodel has to contain semantic knowledge about the production \nprocess as well as the different actuators, sensors and IT \nsystems used within production. Using this information in \nconnection with domain-specific knowledge, the information \nmodel is able to transform the information in order to enable a \nconsolidation of the information in the data structures of the IT nenvironment within the enterprise administration level. \nThe idea of inserting a semantic information model as an \nintermediate layer can also be utilized in the interconnection of \nsignificantly heterogeneous software systems or planning tools. \nHence, the information model, which was introduced together \nwith the VPI platform, is capable of serving an intermediate \ninformation layer between distributed applications and nsimulation or optimization tools. By using the domain-specific \nknowledge about different optimization and software tools, the \nVPI integrates multiple planning and optimization steps into \none holistic planning model. As a consequence, modifications \nin single planning steps will have an impact on the overall \nplanning results, because changes in the project configuration \nare immediately integrated into the overall planning context.  \nIn the next section, the advantages of integrating a formerly \ndistinctive optimization tool into the overall idea of the factory \nplanning project is demonstrated by means of a layout planning \nuse-case Through the integration of different results for \ndetermined process chains into an integrative data basis nmodifications and parameter variations can be dynamically \nperformed at any stage of the planning progress nIV. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL AND MULTI-VARIANT PROCESS \nCHAIN OPTIMIZATION IN LAYOUT PLANNING \nAs mentioned in the state of the art section, layout planning \nis intrinsically characterized by the knowledge as well as by the nexperience values of experts. Hence, decisions made during the \nplanning and determined results are commonly not evaluable in \nan entirely quantitative way. As a consequence, modifications \nand corrections during the planning are inevitable. In order to \nintegrate these changes into further factory planning steps, an ninformation model can serve features to identify cross-module \nconnections within the planning to integrate 


the according \nchanges in all affected planning modules.  \nIn order to store the information as well as domain-specific \nknowledge about the identified cross-module references into a \ndatabase by making use of a suitable information model, multi-\ndimensional databases are one well-established solution. For \ninstance so-called Data Warehouses are filled by performing \nExtraction-Transform-Load \(ETL extraction \nphase, comparatively sparsely structured data is extracted from \na common relational database. In the transformation step, these \ndata are treated to take into account different information views \nand to facilitate reporting functionalities. In the last step, the \ndata is loaded into a Data Warehouse. \nThe layout planning use-case that is carried out in order to \ndemonstrate the advantages of applying multi-dimensional ndatabases in the planning is initiated by data taken from the \nERP level of a producing enterprise. The according data sets \nprovide basic information about the manufacturing process of \nproducts, for example resource group numbers, machinery \nusage, production segment assignment as well as dates and \nmanufacturing durations. The resource group number, which \nrepresents the machine in use, is of special interest here nbecause it can be used to carry out a formal description for the \nmanufacturing process of each product Thus, the production \nInformation Model\n \n \nprocess of each single product can be expressed by process nchains, a row of determined manufacturing steps \(Figure 3 manufacturing steps of products \nThe goal of the layout planning primarily consists in the \ndetermination of the most common process chains. If the \nmanufacturing entities within a factory are placed according to \nthis optimal configuration, the respective products will be \nmanufactured using a minimum of logistical efforts The \noptimization process to perform this ideal allocation of \nmanufacturing resources is carried out in several steps: \n1. Identification of repetitive process chain patterns, \n2. Determination of an a-priori solution for the optimized \nprocess chain configuration, \n3. Validation and improvement of these process chains by \nan iterative optimization algorithm, \n4. Application of time constraints in order to perform a nmulti-dimensional machinery allocation optimization. \nAt first, the given product list, which consists of more than \n30k products, is quantitatively analyzed in order to determine \nthe most frequent products of the historical ERP data. This step \nis performed using counting methods and similarity patterns \nwithin the process chains. Due to the huge amount of possible \nsolutions for this logistical optimization, the determination of \nthe optimal solution is connected to an NP-hard problem. \nConsequently, the described quantitative methods can only \nlead to a semi-optimal solution. This solution is then defined as \nthe a-priori solution to the problem and further developed using \niterative optimization steps. This iterative approach is carried \nout by the following procedure. Firstly, preliminary determined \nchains are checked concerning redundancies and similarities \nthat could be caused by a high dominance of repeating \nproducts. In the next steps, these overlapping process chains \nare systematically replaced by process chains, which represent nproduct configurations that have been undermined within the \nfirst optimization step, but are also of primary importance. \nIn the following step of the process chain formation, time \nconstraints are applied to dynamically further optimize the \nidentified process chains. During the dynamical optimization \nphase, the previously one-dimensional process chain term is \nenhanced to multi-dimensional chains in order to be capable of \ntaking into account different manufacturing times of various \nmachines within the production process Hence, this multi-\ndimensional approach allows a parallel arrangement of the \nproduction entities within one manufacturing chain. As a \nconsequence, waiting times of rather quick or slow machines \ncan be rearranged in order to reach a continuous flow of the \nproducts, which have to be manufactured. \nThe algorithm \(point 4 that provides these functionalities is \ncomprised of several steps that are performed as follows: \n4a Determination of the maximum number of parallel \nmachines for each process chain due to general nconsiderations like space requirements et cetera: \n max,ii nn =  \(1 within each process \nchain that has got the maximal manufacturing time ti, \n max, iii ntt =  \(2 Calculation of the ideal number for each other process \nchain machine j by using the process times ti and tj n :, ijn j ??\ni\nj\nij t\nt\nnn ?=  \(3 determination of the real number for each \nmachine considering the maximal number of parallel \nmachines and the ideal number for each machine \n if \n1\n1\n11\n1\n+\n+\n+?\n?\n?>?\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nj\nn\nt\nn\nt\nn\nt\nn\nt\n \(4 jj nn  \(5 machines that are fully occupied \nto the waiting times of faster machines that are not working on \nits capacity limit. Hence, this optimization procedure creates a \nsetup of process chains with multiple degrees of freedom and \nthus compromises between inevitable waiting and buffer times. \nV. PRELIMINARY RESULTS \nIn preliminary test scenarios, the full algorithm as described \nwas performed multiple times for several parameter variations. \nThe hereby determined process chains were continuously \nvalidated by matching the 


manufacturing configurations of the \nproducts from the ERP systems. After several iterative steps, \nthe results were approaching to a certain boundary value that \ncannot be further improved using static optimization methods.  \nFor this specific test case, the parameter variation was \nperformed for the total number of machine chains in a factory, \nthus the range of this particular parameter was varied between \ne.g. 3 and 6. Hence, each run of the algorithm determines a \nfixed number of so-called main process chains, which represent \nthe ideal machine configuration for this specific use-case. \nThe results of each run were then integrated through the \nintegrative information model served by the VPI Platform. \nThus, the different parameter configurations can be selected \nmodularly for different use-cases or optimization scenarios. \nThe results of each optimization run can consequently be \nvisualized continuously within a Web application, which was \ndeveloped for information management purposes. The use of \nthe web interface allows a user defined parameterization of the \ndifferent scenarios as shown in Figure 4. \nsawing turning grinding assemblingmilling drilling\nturning milling drilling\ngrinding assemblingmilling driling\nProduct 1\nProcess Chain\nProduct 2\n \n nFigure 4.  Web-App for the parametrized vizualisation of optimization results \nIn the figure a screenshot of the user interface for the layout \nplanning module of the factory planning application is shown. \nThe results for the process chain optimization algorithm that \nare visualized in the UI can be modified at each step of the \nplanning progress. The dependencies of these variations to \nother planning modules are consequently integrated in the \noverall planning process. The results for each specific \nparameter configuration can thus be utilized in all following \nplanning steps without further efforts. \nVI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK \nBased on a use case it was demonstrated that the use the \nVirtual Production Intelligence result in far reaching benefits in \nproduction planning. Due to the application of the VPI platform \nvarious constraints and parameters can be considered in the \nplanning. This enables an integrated, holistic view of various \nscenarios of the factory planning so that individual modules of \nthe production planning can be evaluated in the overall context \nof the planning process. Quantitatively reliable statements over \nthe planning success can thus be made at any time. \nIn the context of optimized production planning, the next steps \nwill consist especially in expanding the concepts presented in \nterms of a holistic interconnection of all levels involved in the \nproduction planning as well as in the manufacturing process. \nOn the methodological side, the presented concepts of the nvertical integration of production data have to be realized by \nextending the Virtual Production Intelligence Platform in terms \nof data flows from MES and the field level. These information \nneed to be processed and aggregated automatically so that they \nare available within the ERP systems and production planning. \nOnly through the interoperability between these systems an \nintegrated digital mapping of the production is possible. This \nprovides the basis for intelligent tools for the planning and \ndecision support in order to ensure a continuous improvement \nand further development of the production planning process. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT nThe present work is supported by the German Research \nFoundation \(Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft – DFG within \nthe Cluster of Excellence “Integrative production technology \nfor high-wage countries” at the RWTH Aachen University. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Menrath, M. \(2003 nWettbewerbsstrategie eines Unternehmens der Luftfahrtindustrie zur \nFertigungsstrategie des Standorts.

whether the design \nand staffing of polling places would allow everyone to exercise their right to vote with tolerable waiting. \nHistorical voting patterns including numbers of voters by precinct, actual voter turnout and the percent-\nage of the vote cast by time of day were available, as well as ballot-dependent models of the time to cast a \nvote. Simulations were constructed to assess poll performance for any given staffing level equipment ca-\npacity or registration policies.  \n Here are some reasons why reporting the results of stochastic simulation experiments is not easy: \n Simulations generate a lot of data: Even this simple example generates delay data for each of hun-\ndreds to thousands of voters; congestion data for the polling place, the registration desk and the voting \ndevices; and utilization data for poll workers and voting devices. A complex manufacturing or supply \nchain simulation could easily increase the amount of data by one to two orders of magnitude. The im-\nmense volume of data is one reason that simulation software invariably provides summary reports, typi-\ncally averaging everything in sight; but averaging introduces its own problems. \n Averaging through time masks time-dependent effects: A critical feature of voting is time-varying \nload. In some precincts voting primarily takes place before or after working hours; but a precinct serving \na retirement community will experience a very different distribution of load. The delay experienced by \nvoters, averaged throughout the voting day, will hide the long delays experienced by some voters during \npeak load periods by averaging them with brief delays for voters off-peak. While averaging across repli-\ncations is always statistically helpful, averaging within replications may be bad. \n The performance that interests us is often related to time: Recall our generic output da-\nta nyyy ,,, 21 … . These might be voter waiting times during the simulated day. To be very specific, in a \ntypical simulation these could be the waiting times of n  voters in the order that they completed waiting. \nNotice first that the index is not the order of arrival to the polling place, nor the order of departure from it. \nBut even if the output data were sorted in one of these two ways, it is unlikely that we are interested in, \nsay 32y , the waiting time of the 32\nnd voter of the day to arrive. Instead, the anticipated waiting time as a \nfunction of the time of arrival is what is relevant For instance, what delay might a voter expect who ar-\nrives at noon as opposed to 5 PM?  I am willing to argue that for nearly all systems with time-varying \nload, measures of delay should be indexed by time. But this a more subtle measure to define and estimate. \n A related problem is reporting results for continuous-time outputs, like queue length tQ . These out-\nputs are naturally indexed by time, so it is easy to generate a within-replication time plot of tQ  vs. t  as \nnearly all simulation languages do. Averaging such data across replications to get a better estimate of \nmean queue length as a function of time is certainly meaningful, but how do you do it? The most straight-\nforward way requires saving lots of data from each replication \(the values of itQ and it  at each point in \ntime it  when it changed amount of post-run computation. If a measure of varia-\nbility around this mean queue length is reported, as it should be, then there is even more work. Yet this is \nexactly the sort of information that would be meaningful in the voting model. \n Simulations are conducted in a sequential, exploratory manner: In classical design of experi-\nments, important factors are identified, levels of the factors are chosen, and all of these predefined exper-\niments are executed and the results analyzed. However, since simulations are not physical experiments ndata \(“runs to conduct some simulation studies in a more exploratory fashion. In the voting simulation we might \npick a particular layout and staff, make a few runs, look for problems, and adjust the staffing and capacity \nwhere we see congestion or idleness. How do we summarize a user-guided sequence of experiments on \ndifferent scenarios so as to insure that they did not miss something or get mislead? \n We focus on reporting error instead of risk: We have a historical focus on measures of error while \ndecisions should usually be based on measures of risk; even worse, users often confuse error with risk. A \nconfidence interval \(CI error; measures of error answer the question “have we done \n1278\nTaylor, Brailsford, Chick, L’Ecuyer, Macal and Nelson \n \nenough simulation to estimate whatever?” The answer should be related to the specific context like “I am \ncomfortable being off by ±$1000, but not ±$50,000.” The width of a CI says nothing about the natural \nsystem variability; that is, it says nothing about risk, although many people think that it does. A prediction \ninterval \(PI see when \nwe implement?” Measures of risk should be standard, but they are not. And when reporting either type of \nmeasure we should avoid statistically meaningless precision. See Nelson \(2008 2009 and Wieland and Nelson \(2009 and competing scenarios: It is a rare simulation that pro-\nduces only a single output measure, and for each output there may be more than one property we care \nabout. Trade-offs between costs, quality of service physical space, etc. are common. For some perfor-\nmance measures, the mean \(long-run average 


stability \(standard deviation, tail percen-\ntile, PI multiple scenarios or system designs. This is an \narea in which our reporting is particularly weak. Even the formal statistical comparisons we provide typi-\ncally focus on a single measure, and nearly always compare means rather than measures of risk.  \nThis list of analytics challenges is not exhaustive, but it is a good start. We are currently giving simulation \nusers amazing tools for generating data, but not nearly as much help in getting the most out of these data.  \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has continued the discussion of Grand Challenges in M&S by discussing these from an Opera-\ntional Research/Management Science \(OR/MS It has discussed themes including simulation \nin healthcare, value of information, data modeling, stochastic modeling and optimization, agent-based \nsimulation and simulation analytics. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe work described in C.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
