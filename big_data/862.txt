However, to streamline maintenance procedures and avoid unnecessary delays the engineers and maintainers need current and best estimates of engine performance and health before upcoming flights Using flight condition data

Once a fault event is identified the cause of a fau lt can be traced by linking the in-flight information with the historical maintenance actions that were performed for such an event. A prognostic approach based on double exponential smoothing is also discussed to help identify the trends for flight parameters for upcoming flights.

  2 represents the systems being monitored. Such data includes both on-board flight operational data and off-board aircraft maintenance data. Various methods have been used for data driven fault diagnosis and prognosis and they include statistical methods, machine learning, competitive learning and quality control approaches. A literature review of the data driven fault diagnosis can be found in  Engine health management has been among the top priorities for maintenance departments. Engine health management procedures deal with detection, identification and isolation of faults, prediction of trends in future flights and estimating engine health degradation and overhauls Improved health management procedures can increase airworthiness, mission readine ss and aircraft safety, while reducing aircraft down times and cutting down unnecessary maintenance actions. Several approaches have been researched for engine health management with varying degrees of results The objective of this paper is to provide a methodology to identify engine health deterioration, provide prognostic trending on engine related fli ght parameters and link this information to off-board maintenance procedures. This approach can provide an improved insight into engine performance and health. Such an insight helps maintainers to make accurate, cost saving maintenance decisions The remainder of the paper is outlined as followed: Section 2 gives a brief description of the types of data available from 737 aircraft. In Section 3 e ngine health deterioration is studied using EGT parameter values for 737 engines Section 4 discusses a difference analysis based on flight parameters during different f light phases. Engine health prognostics based on trending of flight parameters and double exponential smoothing is discussed in Section 5 Conclusions and Future work are discussed in Section 6 2  D ATA D ESCRIPTION  The 737 data used for this analysis includes both on-boardflight operational data and offboard data consisting of pilot reports, delay cancellation reports, problem descriptions and maintenance actions performed. Flight data is captured by on-board Aircraft Condition Monitoring System \(ACMS data recorders which include  Quick Access Recorder \(QAR  Smart ACMS Recorder \(SAR The SAR data can be divided into three flight modes: Take off, Cruise and Landing. The QAR data includes various flight parameters that are r ecorded at different sampling intervals. In addition QAR data includes engine reports that provide detailed information about thresholds that are set on a subset of the recorded parame ters. The thresholds are used to identify system anomalies which occur when selected QAR parameters operate beyond these thresholds. This information can be used for diagnosis of engine health by observing in-flight parameters corresponding to 737 engines The maintenance information for 737s can be divided into three kinds of reports: Pilot Reports \(PiRep Reports \(PreMat\ay Cancellation \(DC\Reports These reports in turn provide details like problem descriptions and corresponding corrective actions. The problem description is a summary of both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance actions. It includes aircraft tail number, report date, Aircraft Transport Association \(ATA code which identifies the system or sub-system reported to be malfunctioning. The corrective action is the procedure the maintenance department followed in order to correct the indicated problem. It also reports any flight delays or cancellations caused in response to problem reported by the maintainer Figure 1 \226 Data sources for 737 engine health management Flight data recorders record various flight parameters that have certain nominal operation va lues associated with them A subset of the engine related flight parameters have specific thresholds associated with them.

  3 gradual engine performance de terioration  \(long term rapid \(short-term\eriorati on. Gradual deterioration can sometimes be attributed to ove rall engine aging. However rapid deterioration or a shift in engine parameter trends from normal behavior can be due to a single system, subsystem or component behaving abnormally. If historical flight data is available for a specific aircraft, trending on selected flight parameters can be done to observe if there were signs of gradual or rapid deterioration To demonstrate the application of engine health deterioration analysis, the EG T parameter was analyzed for two different aircraft over a period of one year Approximately 300 flights for each aircraft were used for this analysis. In the firs t phase EGT averages were calculated for each flight. As s hown in Figure 2 for Aircraft 221A\222 the average EGT values show a gradual deterioration over a period of one year. The flights are enumerated in chronological order. Quadratic cu rve fitting was used in this analysis to provide trending on the average EGT values for the available time period. As observed from Figure 2 the EGT average values during each flight show an upward trend as the number of flights increase. This trend can in general be attributed to aging of the aircraft and thus performance degradation of the engine A similar analysis was performed on data from Aircraft \221B\222 As shown in Figure 3 the gradual trend in the average EGT values changes and there is a rapid shift to a higher level of EGT values followed by the continuation of the gradual trend. This window of time where this rapid trend shift occurs can be considered as a possible fault event    To isolate this rapid shift in EGT values a gradient based approach was used. The objectiv e of the gradient approach is to identify the time window corresponding to the rapid shift in a given trend. Gradient approach calculates the difference between successive samples in a given data set The difference values are then used to isolate samples which show a substantial deviation from the mean values For this analysis the mean of the average EGT values for all available flights was used as the reference. The gradient between the average EGT values for each available flight was calculated. To make sure that the outlier data points can be isolated from true trend shifts the gradient for three successive flights should be greater than two standard deviations away from the mean for the available flight data This way the flights for which there is a single spike in the average EGT value can be isolated and ignored as an outlier The final part of this analysis is to provide links to the maintenance information which can assist in diagnosing the cause of the fault event. In addition the maintenance information can also help the maintainer to judge if the fault condition was properly addressed. In this analysis, for the isolated fault event a time window is identified. The time window, aircraft number and ATA codes pertaining to engines are then investigated to pull out maintenance information. The maintenance data includes the problem description and the corresponding repair action that was taken to correct the problem as discussed below   ATA code 72 \226 Engine General  Problem Description During routine inspection found a nick on Engine Blade #14  Corrective Action Repaired and blended nick as per given directives Figure 3 \226 Deterioration of average EGT values for Aircraft \221B\222 Figure 2 \226 Deterioration of average EGT values for Aircraft \221A\222 


  4 4  D IFFERENTIAL A NALYSIS  Evaluation of the engine health can also be accomplished by examining the difference between symmetric engine parameters for various phases of flight. Identification of discrepancies between the performances of the two engines on 737 aircraft provides a means to identify the health of each engine. This analysis is used to determine those instances at which the differe nce between symmetric flight parameters \(EGT, Fuel Flow, etc\205\bstantial. Once identified, those instances are linked to maintenance information in order to understand the possible cause of such a disagreement in symmetric engine parameters This analysis is based on comparing equivalent or symmetric flight parameters fo r each engine on the aircraft Flight parameters such as Exhaust Gas Temperature \(EGT Fan Speeds, Fuel Flows, Engine Vibration, Oil pressure can be used in this analysis to check for discrepancies in operating conditions of the two engines. Exhaust Gas Temperature will be used as the monitored parameter for the initial focus of determining engine degradation. This analysis is based on dividing operational flight data into the three major flight modes 1  Take off  Mode 2  Cruise Mode 3  Landing Mode For each identified flight mode of an observed flight the difference \(or a similarity measure corresponding flight parameters is calculated. In this analysis EGT.1 \(engine 1\\(engine 2\are used as the tracked parameters. The si milarity measure used in determining the difference be tween the tracked parameter for each engine is given as  212  Using the EGT difference values at each sampling interval for a given flight phase the root mean square value for the EGT difference is calculate d for each flight using   1 1 __ n i R MS Fli g htmode x EGT di ff i n    Where i=1,2,\205,n are the number of data samples for each flight phase and x is the flight date. The R.M.S values are then observed as a function of the flight dates. Detection of engine degradation and engine faults are identified as those RMS values which show a large difference between the symmetric parameters for a single flight When a large discrepancy is observed between the EGT parameters for the two engines a possible link between flight data and maintenance data is established and used to investigate maintenance actions made in response to this discrepancy. However, if no such link can be established due to a lack of maintenance or a limited time window used to establish the link the RMS value provides evidence of engine wear. Large disagreements in engine parameters provides leverage to the maintenance departments in which to define improved maintenance actions based on operational conditions of the engine. This will enhance the current state of aircraft maintenance procedures by basing maintenance actions on a measured value of engine health rather than following Fault Isolation Manuals \(FIM\which are based on set time durations not specific to the observed engine The differential analysis results based on EGT values from two distinct 737 aircraft are shown here. The analyzed flight data is divided into the three different flight modes using pre-defined aircraft triggers for each flight mode. The results reported are based on the cruise mode of flight only Figure 5 shows the difference an alysis for Aircraft \221A\222 for approximately 450 flights of which the average flight time is 5 hours. The sample mean and sample standard deviations Figure 4 \226 Engine health deterioration process overview     2 _.1.2 E GT di f f i EGT i EGT i  


  5 for the RMS values for the ava ilable flights are also plotted for reference  Results from analysis seen in Figure 5 show that the concentration of the RMS values are found near the sample mean of all the RMS values. Ho wever, there are a few data points where the RMS values have a substantial deviation from the sample mean. Simple application of this procedure finds that there are large enough differences between the engine\222s EGT values to demonstrate an uneven strain on one engine during cruise flight mode. Considering the flight mode \(cruise e difference in EGT values provides the maintainer and engineer a diagnostic tool in which can be used to identify early engine problems before they become full engine failure Figure 6 reports the difference an alysis for Aircraft \221B\222. In this graph the RMS values have two very different distributions. The early flights show the RMS values to be concentrated near a sample mean of about 10 Degrees C Then around flight 108 there is a significant shift in observed RMS values. The elev ated difference between the EGT values for the two engines lasts for about 200 flights Such a divergence between EGT values of the engines on the same aircraft provides evidence that one of the aircraft\222s engine is operating at a degraded state or the load put on each of the engines is drastica lly uneven. In either case the difference analysis shows significant performance degradation in one of the engines  To investigate further into the differences between symmetric engine parameter values the observed engine parameter values at cruise are modeled as a Gaussian distribution whose density function is given as  2 11 exp 2 2 x fx 265 002 002\003 212 265 and 002 mean and standard deviation respectively, are found using maximum likelihood estimators with a 95% confidence interval For consistency, the flights used to model the respective engine parameter distributions of Aircraft B are the same flights used in the differential analysis. Modeling Aircraft B\222s engines EGT values as a Gaussian distribution it is found that Engine 2 is operating at a much higher temperature than Engine 1 while at cruise. Figure 7 displays the estimated probability densities of the EGT values for each of the engines. It is appa rent that Engine 2 appears to be operating at a different performance level when compared to Engine 1  Figure 6 \226 Difference Analysis results for Aircraft 221 B\222 Figure 5 Difference analysis results for Aircraft 'A 212  The density\222s model parameters 


  6   Modeling the oil pressure for Ai rcraft B, similar differences are found. Figure 8 shows these differences for the oil pressure parameter  It should be noted that each of the engines EGT values are operating below the manufactures predefined EGT threshold. However, if hard thresholds are the only diagnostic tool, then asymmetric behavior in EGT values will never be detected. Because of this the engines can possibly degrade at different rates causing an uneven load distribution during flight. This analysis provides a means to identify early warning signs of engine degradation by examining asymmetric behavior in parallel engine parameters The next step in analysis is to link flight information to the maintenance actions and check for any evidence describing the asymmetry in the EGT values. In addition, the maintenance data will help to determine if any maintenance actions were taken to address the possible engine degradation As shown in Figure 5 there are instances where the RMS values for EGT differences are substantial. Evaluating the maintenance data for these in stances the following problem descriptions and corrective actions were observed  ATA code 77 \226 Engine Indicating  Problem Description During Cruise mode EGT for engine #1 was observed to be 50 Degrees hotter than engine #2  Corrective Action Inspected and cleaned the plugs per fault isolation manual. Ground run was found OK For Aircraft \221B\222 in Figure 6 there is no substantial evidence from maintenance data that the rapid trend shift was addressed. However, it provided a starting point to examine other parameters which demonstrate similar differences that can assist the engineers in narrowing down the cause of the problem. This analysis can in these scenarios help the maintainers and engineers identify trend shifts and make sure they are properly addressed 5  E NGINE H EALTH P ROGNOSTICS  In addition to the diagnostic abilities provided for condition based maintenance, it is important to develop prognostic methods to improve the maintainers and engineers knowledge of the aircraft\222s system behavior of upcoming flights. Prognostic methods provide indicators of engine health and performance for future engine usage. The prognostic methods examined are data driven and thus will be based on current and past e ngine health as seen from the flight operational data and maintenance information. A combination of several engine related parameters can help define the engine health at any given time. If the maintainers are provided with information which details the behavior of these parameters for future flights it can help streamline the maintenance ac tions. The maintainers can also include engine specific maintenance actions in case they observe that the predicted parameter values are approaching their defined threshold values In this analysis the results reported are based on using the EGT values for a given flight which uses operational flight data from each of the engines This analysis can easily be extended to other flight parameters such as fuel flow, fan speeds, oil temperature, pressure and other related engine parameters. The flight data is divided into three flight modes as discussed earlier. In the next step a flight mode is selected and the average EGT values for each engine are Figure 8 Oil Pressure Estimated Probability Density for Aircraft \221B\222 Figure 7 EGT Estimated Probability Density for Aircraft 221B\222

The first smoothing equation adjusts S t directly for the trend of the previous period b t 1 by adding it to the last smoothed value S t 1 This helps to eliminate the lag and brings S t to the appropriate base of the current value. The second smoothing equation then updates the trend, which is expressed as the difference between the last two values. The equation is similar to the basic form of single smoothing, but applied here to the updating of the trend. Using the smoothing equations the upcoming values for the selected flight parame ters can be forecasted. The one-period-ahead forecast is given by ttt bSF 002 007 002 007 006 006 212   y = predicted average EGT value 90.0\1 212   7 calculated. If the maintainer or engineer knows the duration of the upcoming flight, this analysis uses double exponential smoothing to predict the average EGT value for the selected flight mode of the next flight. In addition, this analysis can provide a confidence interval around the predicted EGT value. This confidence interval provides the upper and lower bounds around the predicted average EGT value to give the maintainer an estimate if any necessary maintenance checks should be done before the flight is cleared to operate Double Exponential Smoothing Double Exponential Smoothing is a popular scheme to produce a smoothed time series data. In single moving averages the past observati ons are weighted equally Exponential Smoothing assigns  exponentially decreasing weights as the observation get ol der. In other words, recent observations are given relativel y more weight in forecasting than the older observations. In the case of moving averages the weights assigned to the observations are the same and are equal to 1/N. In exponential smoothing, however, there are one or more smoothing parameters to be determined \(or estimated\de termine the weights assigned to the observations In the smoothing scheme y stands for the original observation and S i stands for smoothed observation. The sub-scripts refer to time periods, 1,2,\205n.

After estimating the predicted average EGT value for the upcoming flight a 90 confidence interval is defined around this estimate using   2 2 nzy nzy L U 002 is the standard deviation where  n are the number of samples Figure 9, 10 and 11 illustrate the Average EGT values in take off, cruise and landing modes for Aircraft \221A\222. These are used as reference for pred icting the average EGT values for upcoming flights in the respective flight modes. The EGT values shown here are for engine #1, this analysis can be repeated for engine #2 also. Table 1 represents the predicted average EGT values per flight phase and the confidence intervals associat ed with these values. The assumption here is that the upcoming flight will be about 240 minute \(4 hour duration The double exponential smoothing based prediction scheme can track the flight parameter values for upcoming flights and assign confidence intervals to the assigned values. This analysis will therefore help th e maintainer in keeping track of flight parameter behavior in different flight modes. The maintainer can then assign possible maintenance actions based on projected values and plan for preventative maintenance Table 1 \226 Predicted EGT values with confidence intervals Flight Mode Predicted Average EGT\(Deg C Upper Confidence Limit\(Deg C Lower Confidence Limit\(Deg C Take off 811.21 833.40 789.00 Cruise 639.10 642.50 635.70 Landing 438.58 460.60 416.60  


  8    6  C ONCLUSIONS  Data driven diagnostics and prognostics algorithms have been applied for engine hea lth management based on both on-board flight data and off-board maintenance data. The engine health degradation analysis is used to distinguish between rapid and gradual dete rioration and identify fault events in case of rapid trend shifts. The fault events can then be linked to maintenance actions that were performed during that event and help narrow the possible cause of the event or identify if the fault was addressed or not. The engine difference analysis focused on the disparity in behavior of the engines on a single aircraft. This analysis tried to identify significant behavior disparities and identify such instances for the mainta iner to evaluate and make future maintenance decisions. The engine health prognostics provide a layout for trending of critical flight parameters for upcoming flights. This additional information can assist the maintainer to make appropriate maintenance and reliability decisions and prioritize maintenance procedures in order to reduce aircraft down time. Knowledge of flight situational parameters will therefore be decisive in avoiding critical faults/failures during flights and improve estimates of engine deterioration 7  R EFERENCES  1 Ortiz, Ash i sh Bab b a r Vassilis Syrm o s Greg o r y Clark, John Vian, Michael Arita, \223Multi-Source Data Integration for Aircraft H ealth Management\224, 2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings, March 2007   J Luo and M  Nam buru 223M odel based prognost i c  techniques\224 Proc.IEEE Syst ems Readiness Technology Conference, September.2003, pp.330-340  St anl e y C Ofst hun and Ti m o t h y J.

  11   Due to the limited amount of test data collected, generating an envelope based on what was tested would have limited STO operations to 4 deg C with less than 3 kt of headwind and 27 deg C with 22 to 25 kt of headwind with a linear variation of temperature with headwind between 3 and 22 kt, as seen in Figure 22.  ST OLCOMP was therefore used to predict results beyond the ambien t conditions tested in order to provide an expanded GW STO envelope.  There were certain limitations of STOLCOMP including:  no presence of a ship airwake model, a two-dimensional flight path, and the inability to model inde pendent longitudinal rotor controls  which reduced confidence in predictions and played a role in how much of an expanded envelope could be recommended.  In an effort to provide an interim capability for fleet training a nd preparation for shipboard deployment, flight test data were reevaluated to determine if expansion was possible for 10 to 30 kt of headwind up to 30 deg C up to a GW of 52,000 lb.  These headwind and temperature limits were chosen based on the amount of landbased data present, as shown in Figure 22   Shipboard test data were not gathered at 52,000 lb for headwinds below 20 kt up to 30 deg C.  Landbased data were gathered beyond GW of 54,700 lb at low headwinds which is equivalent to a GW of 52,000 lb at sea level and 30 deg C.  In addition to headwind and outside air temperature OAT\raints in making a recommended envelope ground roll distance data were also considered.  Ground roll distance as a function of referred GW at different headwind ranges for shipboard and land-based test data are plotted in Figure 23.  Notice that ground roll distances were less than 45 feet for GW up to 55,200 lb.  Even though land-based STO data did not account for the partial ground effect in the shipboard environment, the expanded STO envelope that was granted to the fleet was limited to no lower than 10 kt headwind at GWs greater than 50,000 lb and up to 52,000 lb.  In addition, data showed that ground roll margins of over 300% on LHD class ships existed.  Based on these analyses, sufficient deck run was available to conduct V-22 STO operations aboard LHD 1 class ships with headwinds 10-30 kt for GWs up to 52,000 lb and 30 deg C.  The recommended envelope is shown in Figure 24.

  12   Handling Qualities\227 Day STO handling qualities were also evaluated to grant a day/night vision goggle WOD envelope for the expanded GW envelope Shipboard STO data were analyzed mainly to ensure ad equate control margins, but also to examine for presence of any oscillatory behavior All STOs were rated as DIPES 1 as shown in Figure 17 indicating minimum effort was required to conduct the maneuver.  There was no adverse oscillatory behavior observed during the course of STO testing.  The largest handling qualities impact accord ing to the pilots was a slight directional workload on lift-off.  Pilots also noted minimal deck rolls and good climb performance and commented, that overall, it was a benign maneuver.  Several STOs encountered slight wheelbarrowing effects during the ground roll and nose tucking immediately after lift-off Wheelbarrowing is characterized by mainmounts lifting off prior to nosewheel lift-off during the ground roll and nose tucking is characterized by th e aircraft pitching down just after lift-off.  Two of these ST Os were further analyzed for potentially exceeding the aft l ongitudinal control margin criteria to counter the nose tuck on lift-off; however, it was found later that this large longitudinal input was transient in nature, did not actually exceed the criteria, and was not a concern.  There were found to be no flying quality limitations to the STO conditions flown during this test period  Although night vision goggle STOs were not conducted during this shipboard test, giving a night vision goggle capability was desired.  Thus, previous STO test results for both day/night vision goggle were reviewed to validate the recommended night vision goggle STO envelope which was the same as the recommended day STO envelope, as shown in Figure 24.  Night vision goggle STOs were conducted up to 47,816 lb GW aboard USS WASP in November 2004 and all were rated as DIPES 1, except one which was rated  W OD condi t i ons for t h e DIPES 2 ni ght  vision goggle STO were 345 deg at 28 kt \(7 kt crosswind and pilots commented th at there was noticeable lateral/directional compensation required.  The crosswind present in this DIPES 2 night vision goggle STO may have contributed to the additional lateral/directional compensation and increased workload required by the pilots. Another STO was conduc ted at WOD conditions of 349 deg at 29 kt \(5 kt crosswind\t was rated as a DIPES 1, but pilots also commented on some lateral compensation that was required.  The recommended expanded envelope only granted up to +/- 5 kt crosswind thus the night vision goggle STO envelope which has the same limits as the recommended day STO envelope was granted to the fleet  Additionally, the effects of GW on the handling qualities were analyzed.  Three STOs, which were all at headwinds of 20 kt, were evaluated to determine the effects of increased GW on aircraft handling qualities.  The GWs of the three STOs were 47,224 lb, 51,043 lb, and 54,982 lb The WOD direction for each STO was 355 deg, 002 deg and 351 deg, respectively.  All three STOs showed low amplitude inputs in the lateral and directional axes.  Control inputs in the longitudinal axis were of moderate amplitude It appeared that there was an initial input aft to counter the wheelbarrowing tendency and then approximately a 2.5 to 3 inches forward stick input to keep the pitch attitude less than 5 deg noseup.  For the two lighter GW STOs, pilots commented on a small wheelbarrow tendency and minor control inputs.  For the STO at a GW of 54,982 lb, pilots commented that there was no wheelbarrowing and it was low workload.  All three STOs were rated as a DIPES 1 Therefore, GW was determined to have a negligible effect on STO handling qualities and it was deemed safe to grant an envelope of +/- 10 deg of the bow out to 30 kt WOD for GWs up to 52,000 lb  Ship Motion\227 Since the most ship pitch/roll experienced during the day STO testing was 0.3 deg and 1 deg respectively, additional analysis was conducted to be able to grant the previous STO ship motion limits of +/- 2 deg pitch and +/- 3 deg roll for the recommended GW envelope  A performance analysis was conducted to determine additional ground roll distance required during a STO which occurred at the maximum ship pitch limit of 2 deg Analysis of land-based STOLCOMP takeoff and static  Figure 24 V-22 STO Envelope aboard LHD Class Ships 


  13 surface pitch calculations showed that at 52,000 lb, 35 deg C day, headwind of 25 kt, takeoff distance increased by approximately 0.5 feet/deg of surface pitch.  At these conditions, takeoff distances were approximately 30 feet Thus, assuming the 2 deg ship pitch limit, the ground roll distance would increase by approximately 3 STOLCOMP analysis showed that for 55,000 lb at 35 deg C and a headwind of 25 kt, takeoff distance increased by approximately 4 feet/deg of surface pitch.  At these conditions, takeoff distances were approximately 50 feet Thus, assuming the 2 deg ship pitch limit, the ground roll distance would increase by approximately 16%.  The increase in ground roll due to ship pitch was calculated using the slope correction formula from a test pilot school flight test manual for land-based takeoff performance with the assumption that a 2 deg slope remained constant throughout the STO ground roll  Land-based fl i ght  t e st  data were evaluated to determine the effect of ship pitch on ground roll.  A land-based STO was conducted at a GW of 52,725 lb with a pressure altitude of 23 feet and OAT of 23.9 deg C and resulted in a ground roll of 36 feet and takeoff velocity of 14 kt.  The ground roll distance increase due to a 2 deg slope was approximately 6.3 feet, which accounted for a 17.5% increase in ground roll  From a handling qualities perspective, the proposed ship motion limits were the same as what was recommended from previous tests conducted at lighter GWs.  Previous tests conducted aboard USS SAIPAN \(LHA 2\ted in recommendations for ship motion limits of pitch +/- 1 deg and roll +/- 3 deg.  Tests conducted aboard USS WASP LHD 1\ resulted in recommendations that increased ship pitch motion limits to +/- 2 deg.  For tests conducted aboard USS SAIPAN \(LHA 2\, pilot ratings showed that little effort was required.  STO te sts aboard USS WASP \(LHD 1 were considered benign.  Due to the small ship motion limits being proposed and the benign handling qualities encountered at light GWs, it was not expected that unacceptable handling qualities w ould be encountered at GWs up to 52,000 lb  Based on the previous test data and analysis provided, safe STO operations could be accomp lished aboard LHD 1 class ships with ship pitch limits of   +/- 2 deg and ship roll limits of +/- 3 deg.  The recommended STO envelopes aboard LHD 1 class ships restricted ship pitch limits to +/- 2 deg and ship roll limits to +/- 3 deg, as shown in Figure 24 MROL Envelope Expansion A total of 11 MROLs were conducted completing 6 of the 52 planned MROL test points with required repeats.  Due to limited test time at sea, only MROL touchdown predictability and GW expans ion tests were conducted Table 2 provides a summary of conditions under which tests were completed Table 2.

Figure 26 presents stopping distance as a function of TSRTS for both touchdown predictability tests as well as GW expansion Note that touchdown predicta bility test points for TSRTS from 12 to 15 kt resulted in stopping distances from 89 to 121 feet.  Although there is so me variability in the stopping distance based on TSRTS, it was determined that 15 kt was appropriate TSRTS to allow a safe stopping distance and provide some margin of safe ty for variability in touchdown speed.  Test results demonstrated that MROL ground roll distances with TSRTS up to 22 kt could be achieved with the flight deck space availa ble aft of the island                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                20 075 272 060 272 045 272 030 272 015 272 345 272 000 272 330 272 285 272 300 272 315\272 30 25 10 5 35 kts 15 DIPES 1 DIPES 2 DIPES 3 DIPES 4 DIPES 5 DATA KEY Black Line:  Initial Test Envelope Gross Weight Color Key 48 klb Blue 51 klb Green 54 klb Orange                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                20 075 272 060 272 045 272 030 272 015 272 345 272 000 272 330 272 285 272 300 272 315\272 30 25 10 5 35 kts 15 DIPES 1 DIPES 2 DIPES 3 DIPES 4 DIPES 5 DATA KEY Black Line:  Initial Test Envelope Gross Weight Color Key 48 klb Blue 51 klb Green 54 klb Orange  Figure 25 MROL Data Fairing 


  14  The touchdown positions relativ e to the target touchdown point are presented in Figure 27.  Aside from the one outlier, pilots were able to accu rately land the aircraft within the touchdown zone.  The av erage touchdown position was approximately 9.3 feet beyond and 0.3 to the left of the target touchdown point Based on this data, the probability of landing longitudinally within +/-25 feet of the spot 9 mainmount markings was greater than 99 %. The probability of landing laterally within +/-3 feet of the spot 9 mainmount markings was greater than 99 %.  From this data, there was high confidence that pilots would be able to accurately place the aircraft within the touchdown zone  GW expansion tests continued using the TSRTS of 15 kt Note on Figure 26 that the increased GW did not change the stopping distance required for a given TSRTS.  As stated in the method of test, the torque on approach was monitored to ensure sufficient excess power wa s available to arrest rate of descent and waveoff on the approach.  The peak torque required on approach was plotted against referred GW as shown in Figure 28.  Even at the highest GW tested, a 33 torque margin was maintained throughout the approach Based on the GWs tested, the minimum WOD speed of 20 kt allowed MROL with sufficient power margin Handling Qualities\227 Throughout the touchdown predictability and GW expansion tests, pilots evaluated the handling qualities of the aircraft using DIPES.  Pilots noted the largest workload was in the lateral axis, getting lined up with the ship on short final.  The general pilot sentiment was that MROLs were a benign maneuver for the GWs tested.  In addition, the pilots commented that maintaining ground speed relative to the ship during a MROL actually created an easier approach than attempting to decelerate to a hover, reducing lateral workload as the aircraft crossed the deck edge.  The MROL technique was validated in the shipboard environment    CONCLUDING REMARKS  This paper has provided an overview of the test methodology used in order to conduct V-22 sea trials in support of increased shipboard STO capabilities for the fleet 3 Th e o b j ectiv es o f th is test were p artially m et.

  15 possibility of granting an envelope to the fleet exists  Further testing has been recommended to continue expansion of the day/night vision goggle STO envelope aboard LHD 1 class ship up to a GW of 58,000 lb for headwinds 0-45 kt and crosswinds of up to +/- 10 kt.  It has also been recommended to conduct further testing to gather required data to validate the STOLCOMP model in order to extrapolate beyond tested am bient conditions.  Future testing will also involve inve stigating the MROL technique for GWs up to 58,000 lb along with similar headwind and crosswind limitations  STO and MROL GW and wind envelopes are currently still under development for LHD 1 class ships but have made significant progress in terms of providing additional capabilities to the fleet.  Alt hough future testing has been recommended and is desired, the limited number of amphibious assault class ships and numerous operational commitments poses a challenge to completing these types of shipboard tests.  Until more accurate modeling and simulation tools become available to support shipboard envelope development, full scale sea trials, although costly and time intensive, will continue to be the way forward in granting increased shipboard capabilities to the fleet ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The support from the crew of the USS IWO JIMA is greatly appreciated and acknowledged.  The efforts of the V-22 test team, along with Boeing Flying Qualities and Aerodynamics personnel, were invaluable in accomplishing this testing REFERENCES  1  Geyer, W., \223V-22 Ship Suitability Tests Aboard USS BATAAN and USS WASP\224, NAVAIR Report of Test Results, 27 September 2006 2  USNTPS-FTM-NO. 108, Fixed Wing Performance Chapter 9 Takeoff and Landing Performance, 30 September 1992 3  Geyer, W., Mitchell, V., Weinstein, D. \223V-22 Shipboard Short Takeoff \(STO\ Minimum Run-on Landing \(MROL\Report of Test Results, 14 October 2008  BIOGRAPHY  Jennie Mitchell is a 2006 graduate from Georgia Tech with a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering.
