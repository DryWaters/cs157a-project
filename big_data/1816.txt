Room 206, No.1 Building, No.535, Fa Huazhen Road Shanghai, China, 200052  pzzhang@sjtu.edu.cn Abstract Despite its importance in government operations, G2G information sharing remains a great challenge worldwide. While current literature examined the challenge primarily in western countries, this study was conducted to better understand the G2G information sharing in Chinese 
context. The in-depth field study methodology is applied based on two G2G information sharing activities. After interviewing with department officials, administrative staffs and technical staffs of government agencies, the data are analyzed based on the Layered Behavioral Model----including external environment layer, super-managerial agencies layer, inter-agency partnership layer organizational readiness layer and individual expectation layer. Especially, it is found that GuanXi and senior management commitment 
are important for the success of G2G information sharing in China. As a result, the Extended Layered Behavioral Model is formed for further research The finding will help to better identify critical characteristics and elements of G2G information sharing among government agencies  1 Introduction The research of information sharing between government agencies has been highlighted after the post-9/11 scrutiny of terrorism events \(Atabakhsh 
Chen, etc, 2004\ers not only law enforcement information but also disease informatics, public education, economic development and geographic information \(McDougall, 2005; Atabakhsh, Chen 2004, etc\ There have been many G2G activities in China and  worldwide, such as Government Connects project in UK, E-Port Project in China, and the State of Louisiana Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Report Program in USA. G2G information 
sharing refers that two or more government agencies share their information and cooperate with each other through Internet, Extranet, disks, EDI, phone and other electronic tools which can lead to effective service and monitoring goals \(Akbulut,2002 Historically, government agencies in China acted as stovepipes, different functional agencies managed their own information resource separately 
Nowadays, with the development of e-government in China, most of the government agencies have set up their own information systems. However information sharing has been just limited within the same functional agencies while information sharing among horizontal functional agencies is still faced with many obstacles such as inconsistent data 
standards, poor interoperability, and public privacy which result in the phenomena of çinformation isolation On one hand, due to the absence of information sharing, functional agencies operate separately Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 Crown Copyright 


without back-office information sharing and interoperability. That leads to non-integrity services for government customers \(citizens and businesses On the other hand, in our current age of high mobility and increasing availability of technology criminals are able to take advantage of the fact that limited information sharing across government regulation agencies reduces the likelihood of getting caught \(Atabakhsh&Chen2004  Therefore, it is necessary for us to take a detailed understanding about G2G information sharing among horizontal agencies in China. The next section introduces the theoretical background of G2G information sharing. The third section delineates our research methodology while introduces the concept of Layered Behavior Model as the analytical framework of our research. The fourth section presents the results followed by discussion of the research. Finally, summarize our findings and present further research opportunities  2 Literature Review Most of the past studies have addressed the external environments of G2G e-government from the view of laws and policies which will urge or promote the development G2G information sharing According to Dawes\(1996,1997\ successful information sharing initiatives external environment should includes \(a\al framework and formal policies that guide information sharing decisions and activities, and \(b\ective tools that guide the management of shared public data were necessary Landsbergen and Wolken \(2001\sidered that interoperability means sharing information and proposed an integrated federal/state system architecture which developed legal, policy and managerial approaches to maintain interagency information Since decision-making for IT adoption is typically concentrated at the super-level administrative management, a project-wide championship agency should be committed to implementing and overseeing the G2G information sharing initiative at the higher level \(Alkburk, 2002  The super-managerial agencies for G2G information sharing are essential to gather interest and coordinate its implementation by making policies, provide information and technical support especially early in the implementation process \(Garfield,2000  From the points of partnership, G2G information sharing means interoperability among government agencies \(Landsbergen and Wolken 2001\which is the precondition of interoperability Unlike many business to business \(B2B\ or government to business \(G2B\ partnership, which are generally focuses on improving economic outcomes inter-agencies partnership generally have a significant focus on achieving public good or improved public service\(Kevin,2006  G2G information sharing is also regarded as an innovative activity participating by government agencies. Based on innovative diffusion theory, many scholars studied G2G information sharing mainly focusing on technological and organizational characteristics \(Akbulut 2002, Kamal and Themistocleous,2006\It concerns the factors such as cost, IT resources and competence, organizational leadersê attitude, business process, and others In additions, for any innovative activities organizational individuals are always regarded as the most important factors. The attitude and initiative of employees partly determine the adoption effect of G2G information sharing. Dawes\(1996\uggested that expected benefits and risks of individuals are influenced by their previous sharing experience. In turn, expected benefits and expected risks will influence and form the actual experience of G2G information sharing The aim of this study is to understand the challenges of G2G information sharing in Chinese context among horizontal functional agencies. In particular, we are interested in answering the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


following question: what are key factors influencing G2G information sharing activities across horizontal functional agencies in Chinese context 3Research Method 3.1Research Design Since the objective of our research is to analyze challenges of G2G information sharing in current Chinese context, we adopted an in-depth field-study approach. We apply Eisenhardtês\(1989\uidelines for field study research in conjunction with the guidelines for case study research. Table 1 summarizes our study design, comparing it to recommendations made by Eisenhardt\(1989 3.2An Analytical Framework Based on Layered Behavior Model\(LBM To structure our analysis of existing challenges for G2G information sharing, we take use of the concepts of çLayered Behavioral Modelé \(LBM\or Table1 Our Study Design Compared to Eisenhardtês Recommendations Eisenhardtês\(1999\commended steps Our study design 1\etting started: Define research question The research question is defined.

Large software systems are thought generated by humans rather than machines, therefore the creation of large software development must be analyzed as a behavioral process \(Curtis 1988\urtis \(1988\ proposed that the large software development can be studied at following behavioral levels\(Figure 1\hese cumulative effects can be represented in the layered behavioral model   Fig1 The Layered Behavioral Model  of   Software Development In this paper, the thought-way of layered Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


behavioral model LBM is applied into the research of G2G information sharing which extends the scope from individual organizational project development to inter-agency project development. Although there is a different gap between large software projects and G2G information sharing activities, there are enough reasons for us to use LBM in the analysis of G2G information sharing activities. First, both of them can be regarded as complicated and multi-layered creative activities. Second, both of their purposes are to explore what and how the problems \(factors affect the activity processes at different levels In this paper, a layered behavioral model of G2G information sharing is set up to help us analyze the research question \(Figure 2 1\ternal environment layer.

The following are general introductions about these two cases Case1:çEnterprises Reputation Platformé in FengXian District, Shanghai, China  In 2005, the çEnterprises Reputation Platformé in FengXian District was set up which integrated enterprisesê main information including basic business records, tax payment records export and import records, loan records, product quality records, and so on. Four functional agencies have participated in this program and shared their information through this platform The purpose of the platform is to unify enterprises information so that strengthen regulating on enterprisesê market activities and prevent tax evasion. By the end of Apr. 2006, this database has contained 42 items related enterprises reputation information of more than 4000 enterprises in FengXian District  Case 2: çShannxi E-Port Systemé in Shannxi Province, China The çShannxi E-Port Systemé mainly services for import-export business. The system is planned to set up a network verification management mode which is composed of 8 functional agencies and have been put into application in 2007. They will share information like basic enterpriseês records, foreign trade contracts, customs declaration, export rebates Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


records, foreign currency records, and so on. The main advantage of this system is: 1 one-windowé service for customs operation through internet. 2\ prevent illegal activities which took advantage of little communication among government agencies and intend to forge documents for smuggle, cheat foreign exchange and cheat tax rebates. By this, an effective mutual service and monitoring system has been formulated in Shannxi province  4Research Analysis Based on the analysis and literatures above we break down the research area into five more specific research question \(R1\ through \(R5 R1\at are characteristics of external environment in China For external environment, laws and policies are the main factor mentioned by interviewees Laws and policies refer to the existence of clear legal norm, regulation, or organizational procedures, formal process for carrying out organizational tasks. Three characteristics of current legislations and policies of G2G information sharing are found Lack of formal legislations  Lack of legislation for G2G information sharing is frequently mentioned by interviewees Although there are lots of policies and guidelines for various G2G information sharing activities there is still not any formal law supporting G2G information sharing activities. In this sense, G2G information sharing is always discretionary and lacks the compelling force of formal law  Informalization Commission Nothing can force the agencies to participate in the activitiesÉ.there is lack of the formal legal authority  Insufficiency of detailed operating instructions Many interviewees mentioned that most policies just give a direction of G2G information sharing, but still lack of detailed instructions for operation. The most demanded policies for instructions mentioned by interviewees include:\(1\ government information resources and their distribution systems; \(2\rules for information sharing scope and sharing manner; \(3\national-wide data standards and technological standards;\(4\ecurity protocol standards of G2G information sharing 5\igning standards of G2G information sharing processes Inconsistency of existing policies The inconsistency of existing policies exists in two aspects. On one hand, the policies among different functional agencies are inconsistent. On the other hand, the policies between local governments and functional agencies are inconsistent. That always leads G2G information sharing in dilemma Summary Although various policies have been set up for G2G information sharing, G2G information sharing still meets great challenges in external environment level. First, it is still in the early stage of G2G information sharing development, the policies are not sufficient in detailed guiding operation; Second, different functional agencies and different hierarchical government set up different polices on G2G information sharing, and lack of a nation-wide architecture; Third, there is still not any formal law on G2G information sharing R2\hat are the characteristics of super-managerial agencies in Chinese context  Different to the çregionally oriented Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


organizational structure in western countries, there is a network-oriented government structure in China which mainly depends on çTIAO administration. TIAO refers to the same functional administrative systems from the local government level up to the central government level \(for example, district-level taxation bureau, city-level taxation bureau, province-level taxation bureau central-level taxation bureau\IAO is also called vertical agencies, or functional agencies. KUAI refers to different functional agencies in a local administrative government \(including provincial government, city government, district government etc\I is also called horizontal agencies, or local governments    Fig3 Government Structure for TIAO and KUAI Administrative management in China mainly relies on TIAO systems. The separation of TIAO and KUAI is a serious problem in China which leads to the absence of common management agencies for different vertical functional agencies Therefore, an authoritative common super-managerial agency is very important for promoting and coordinating the cooperation among horizontal government agencies. It is found that there are three kinds of super-managerial agencies in China  Informationalization commission of local governments as common super-managerial agencies It is the main pattern for district-level or city-level G2G information sharing activities in China, such as the case of çEnterprises Reputation Platformé in our study. The advantage of this pattern is local Informationalization Commission can understand the demands of local governments better. However the informationalization commissions in local governments have not enough decision-making power in those functional agencies. This will lead to weak management authority and coordination authority Informalization Commission It is very difficult, especially at the beginning of G2G information sharing, we have to talk with the agencies one by one. We have no right to order them  state council\(refers to central government of China\igns a super-managerial team as the super-managerial agencies When G2G information sharing involves many functional agencies and is urgently needed by the whole nation, like the case E-PORT in our study which is related with the management of foreign exchange and trade duty in China, central government will pay priority attention. G2G information sharing will be designed and developed from national wide while local governments are responsible to set up and put it in practice. The advantage of this pattern is common super-managerial agencies have enough authority to coordinate all the central-level functional agencies which have the direct leadership on province-level, city-level district-level functional agencies. However, such activities always require huge manpower and economic investment  Customs E-port is promoted under the leadership of our former Premier. Every functional agencies pay great attention on it and invest a great deal. The effect is significant A managerial team composed of the members from the participating agencies as a super-managerial team Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


When several agencies have a strong demand for information sharing and can realize reciprocity and mutual benefit, those agencies may joint efforts to build up the super-managerial team However, this patter seldom exists in China due to emergence of various conflicts during G2G information sharing. The third party is more suitable for coordinating and gathering the interests of all the participating agencies  Summary The ideal super-managerial agencies have enough authority in gathering and coordinating all the functional agencies. In China, because of the special government structure, most of the super-managerial agencies except State Council have no direct leadership on functional agencies That leads to great challenge for their work  R3\hat are the characteristics of cooperation and coordination among government agencies in Chinese context Interagency Trust As far as the interagency trust is concerned directly, some interviewees appeared bureaucratic and formalistic. They always illustrated that  Administration of Industry and Commerce all agencies are under the leadership of Communist Party, we certainly trust each other However, with the interview going on deeply many interviewees apparently showed their distrust on their partners when the detailed business operation is discussed. One is the trust in the validity and accuracy of data collected by other agencies. Due to the lack of mutual trust among agencies, each agency tends to collect its own information about the same subject. The other is more important, participating agencies are not sure if other agencies will take use of their data in the right way Taxation Bureau It is a problem of data security. We are not sure whether they will use our data in the right matter. Because we can not control the data as soon as they are shared to other agencies GUAN XI In the interview, it is found that the interviewees frequently mentioned the word GUAN XIé which is a characterized word in China. GuanXi refers to interpersonal or inter-organizational relationships and places high values on social networks, trust, commitment favor, mutuality, reciprocity and long-term benefits\(Shin,Ishman,ect,2007\as been regarded as the lifeblood of interpersonal or inter-organizational relationships and business conduct in Chinese society \(Luo,2001\ Good GuanXi among agencies or officials can greatly increase interagency trust and promote cooperation ability during the G2G information sharing Administration of Industry and Commerce We often cooperate in supervision of business activities and have very good GuanXi. So it is easy to communicate with them during G2G information sharing  Informalization Commissi the vice-chief of Administration of Industry and Commerce played an important role in promoting the participation of other agencies. She is good at communication and has good GuanXi with other officials However, many agencies still have not been aware of its sense for collaboration among government agencies Taxation Bureau the most insufficient things during the G2G information sharing activities are not technology, not finance, but lack of communication and mutual understanding which will lead to trust with each other  Interagency Compatibility Compatibility emerged as a frequently cited Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


factor influencing local ag ency participation in this initiative which includes organizational compatibility and technical compatibility Organizational compatibility refers to the fitness of the changes introduced by G2G information sharing with existing needs, objectives, functions and cultures  Informalization Commissi you know, it has lots of work to do for setting up the Reputation Platform. And those agencies are busy with their own business. That is to say, they have other needs in prior urgent but not G2G information sharing Technical compatibility refers to the fitness of information sharing system with existing applications and information systems. The study shows that different government agencies apply different information systems which lead to some difficulties for information sharing technology  Central Government Agencies In the beginning of e-government development in our country \(China\, there is no uniform standard Each functional department applied its own operation systems. The disadvantage is exposed with the development of information sharing  The different data format is another major obstacle of information sharing across government agencies. Even if the government departments are willing to share information, information sharing is still very difficult because of different data definitions and lack of certain standards of data transmission Informalization Commission Different data formats led us into lots of troubles. We are employing more than ten persons to contrast these data. A big workload Customs No agency would like to change their data format. That is problem. So during G2G information sharing, we developed a set of data transferring system which transfers the data from each agency automatically Although it is difficult to integrate the existing information systems and data, most technical staffs thought these problems can be solved. However, it may cost a lot  Summary G2G information sharing is the representative activities across government agencies Inter-agency partnership is a decisive factor for the success of G2G information sharing activities. In essence, the TIAO and KUAI government administrative system plays an important role in the inter-agency partnership. So the authority of super-managerial agencies is a crucial actor in G2G information sharing  R4\hat are agenciesê characteristics participating in G2G information sharing Leaderês support Leaderês support is the most frequently factor mentioned by interviewees. Research shows that the realization progress of G2G information sharing is slow without the support of agencyês leaders Informalization commission At the beginning of G2G information sharing, we always communicate with the leaders of every agency at first. Just needs five-minute-talk, I can judge if the agency will participate actively In our research, for most conditions, leaders of government agencies in China are willing to participate in G2G information sharing, especially interested in electronic business activities by G2G information sharing  IT capability IT capability is a freque nt factor mentioned influencing G2G information sharing. In our study those agencies seemed to have already acquired a certain level of IT infrastructure and their employees were better trained in using information Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


technologies. However, as far as the telecommunication is concerned, it is still in the early stage of G2G information sharing compared with western countries. Most agencies, especially lower-level agencies are lack of enough IT software and hardware, and also lack of experts  Meanwhile, most interviewees thought technological skills are not the most difficult problems for G2G information sharing. For one hand, agencies can only adopt basic IT technologies, such as phones, faxes, disks, etc. For the other hand, agencies can depend on the third part as IT support department  Cost Cost is one of the most frequently factors that interviewees mentioned. Cost includes setup cost running cost, integration cost, maintaining cost as well as training cost and communication cost However, G2G information sharing involves several agencies, the most difficult situation is who will load the cost of G2G information sharing Taxation Bureau Information sharing is a good thing. The problem is who will pay for the bills Moreover, many agencies also lacked the personnel to participate in G2G information sharing Administration of Industry and Commerce our bureau is a primary-level bureau, has to deal with lots of daily business, including registration supervision, year-inspection, etc. It was very difficult to assign additional persons to attend G2G information sharing Information Security Information security refers to the capability to make sure the information flow securely during G2G information sharing processes. Government agencies always own lots of public and national information concerning with business secrets or personal privacy. As soon as the information is shared with other agencies, information security can not be controlled by one agency which is challenged in every process of information sharing Information disclosure in any process may cause problems for citizensê privacy and business secrets Informalization Commission the precondition of G2G information sharing is to make sure the security of shared information in every process from internal and external threats Summary In order to participate in G2G information sharing activity, agencies need be ready in various aspects. Therein, the most important factor mentioned by interviewees is leaderês support while the most obstacle factor is cost. Although technological problems are also obstacles, most interviewees still regarded that it is possible to solve those technological problems. However how much will it cost to solve them? So, the realization of technological integration depends on the financial support on the G2G information sharing. Furthermore, information security is the guarantee for information transfer among government agencies R5\hat are the cognitive characteristics of organizational members for G2G information sharing in government agencies Perceived benefits Perceived benefits emerge as a frequently factor mentioned by interviewees. The field study shows that G2G information sharing initiative helps government agencies achieve certain benefits such as increased information accuracy and timeliness, streamlined data management, and improved decision-making Import and Export Bureau of Taxation Administratio The biggest benefits of E-Port Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


are illegal activities are avoided completely forging files seldom emerges now Perceived risks Information is the symbol of power of a government agency. Agencies can obtain certain benefits by monopolizing information. G2G information sharing will result in the decentralization of an agencyês power. Therefore although G2G information sharing can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the whole government, it may be against some agenciesê or officialsê political interests  Central Government Agency  information sharing among government agencies means the re-distribution of power among government agencies It is also found that there is a potential political competition culture among functional agencies. The functional agencies in the same local governments may compete for the administrative performance and the officials of the different agencies may compete for the chance of promoting Informalization Commission in most degree, the G2G information sharing is not a technological problem, it is more like a political problem. Apparently, some agencies get the shared information from other agencies, they will gain greater effect in services and supervision for business market activities. And then, they will obtain more political interests than other agencies Meanwhile, the agencies which provide the information may lose its original interests For economic losses, the most common situation is that information monopoly can obtain rent-seeking benefits for government officers However, it will be lost or decentralized when the information is shared  Central Government Agency Much information like real estate information, stock exchange information have huge value. Officers always can get great grey income when the information is disclosed Another situation is that information is value-added because of information sharing and integration. Many agencies are afraid that their benefits may be taken over by other  Summary Most government leaders and staffs have realized the benefits of G2G information sharing However, the perceived risks in politics or economics greatly influence the development of G2G information sharing. The protection of the political benefits always is the hardest obstacle not only for G2G information sharing but also for system reform of Chinese government 5 Discussions and Implication  First, to national and local governments, in external environment layer, various levels of Chinese government agencies have prepared and promulgated a lot of policies and regulations on electronic administration and government information resource management in the recent years. However, the result of our research also indicates that these policies have not been enforced strongly enough, and many agencies havenêt obeyed these policies due to their own benefits. For instance, E-government Standardization Guide has been set up in 2002 many agencies still act according to their own demands and convenience which results in even worse incompatibility national-wide. However, no formal laws or policies can punish their disobedient acts Secondly, in super-managerial agencies layer the pushing and harmonizing roles of common upper-level managerial agencies are especially important for promoting the collaboration among horizontal functional agencies. However, most of them have no enough authority when they face Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 


with various functions conflicts and interest conflicts among different agencies. That is because the separation of TIAO and KUAI is a serious problem in China Thirdly, in terms of interagency partnership layers among government agencies, the research reveals the GuanXi between government agencies especially the GuanXi between top-level leaders of agencies promotes the information sharing very significantly. It is found that interviewees of governmental agencies in China are strongly sensitive to the word of çtrusté. Actually, the distrust exists although they didnêt admit it Fourthly, in terms of organizational readiness the research results indicate that the most outstanding influencing factor is leaderês support Therefore, the design of motivating and supervising mechanisms of the officials of functional agencies are very important. However what is interesting is: contrary to the research result of Akbulut \(2002\ and other researchers, the research result indicates that IT ability is not a significant obstacle factor for G2G information sharing in China. It shows that other factors have stronger effects, the preventing role of the technology ability is concealed and remains insignificant Finally, in terms of individual expectation layer, for the governmental staffs, the research reveals that the expected risks of the employees has the most effect on G2G information sharing because information sharing leads to not only the losses of political power, but also the losses of rents and economic benefits \(Zhang and Dawe,2007\his indicates that the realization of G2G information sharing depends on the political awareness of the employees, especially the governmental officials  6Conclusions The purpose of our exploration has been to uncover the factors which challenge G2G information sharing activities from several layers With more understanding of the influencing factors, challenges and needs, we assumed, we would also be better able to identify critical characteristics and elements of G2G information sharing among government agencies in Chinese context. According to the results of the field study we extend the Layered Behavior Model of G2G information sharing which is shown in Fig.3 which will be taken as the conceptual model for survey study in the future  One limitation of this paper is that all the interviews were taken during the same period Furthermore, it is necessary for us to probe into one or more G2G information sharing activities from the beginning to its all process     Fig3 Extended Layered Behavior Model of G2G Information Sharing Reference 1 Akbulut.
