In addition, cost effective sustainment of military propulsion systems implies continued maintenance and enhancement of RDB to address the inevitable emerging reliability issues that were neither anticipated nor detected during propulsion system design and development The expectations of TLCSM and the resultant deployment of CBM+, RCM and PHM will place increasing demands on RDB in terms of data coll

Integration with associated cost and logistics data bases will facilitate CBM RCM application.  Advanced analysis tools will support proactive oversight of deviations from expected reliability using machine intelligence to alleviate information overload on RDB users.  RDB will evolve based on, and supporting advanced models of propulsion system reliability that are 
automatically updated in response to field data and provide timely and dependable forecas ts of propulsion system reliability, maintenance effort and logistical requirements 2   1  1   U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright 2 IEEEAC paper #1587, Version 5, Updated January 28, 2008 T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION  1  2  T OTAL

The prim ary objective of Defense acquisition is to acquire quality products that satisfy user needs with measurable improvements to mission capability and operational support, in a timely manner, and at a fair and reasonable price 
The US Department of Defense Acquisition Guid  states in Section 4.1.3 Total Life Cycle Systems Management \(TLCSM\n Systems Engineering:  “It is fundamental to systems engineering to take a total life cycle, total systems appro ach to system planning development, and implementati on. Total life cycle systems management \(TLCSM\s the planning for and management of the entire acquisition life cycle of a DoD system.  Related to the total systems approach, DoD Directive 5000.1, E1.29 makes the program manager accountable for TLCSM”. \(See Table 1 The Defense Acquisition Guide book continues: “Because of TLCSM, the program manager should consider nearly all systems development decisions in

PMs shall consider supportability, life cycle costs performance, and schedule comparable in making program decisions Planning for Operation and Support and the estimation of total ownership costs shall begin as early as possible Supportability, a key component of performance, shall be considered throughout the system life cycle   Reliability data bases are comm only maintained in industry and the military where complex, critical equipment is subject to sustained operation and repeated maintenance RDB typically record all significant maintenance activity with emphasis on equipment failures.  See Cooke Be for a m o re det a i l e d descri pt i on RDB for military systems may encompass many hundred nominally identical systems \(i.e pieces of equipment a service lives measured in decad  for an example.  In addition to calendar based records of maintenance actions \(including both scheduled preventive maintenance and unscheduled tasks in response to fault indications and failures\ay encompass measures of cumulative usage \(e.g., operational cycles and duration\guration logs for individual systems Ideally the RDB will also retain, or enable retrieval of salient findings from servicing, preventive maintenance repairs and shop visits, includi ng parts replacements.  Thus the RDB provides the data necessary to measure and understand the systems’ reliability over time and as a function of usage and configuration.  This information may be used to track the reliab ility of system components and assess impacts on system availability.  RDB can also provide information on the effectiveness of maintenance actions and inform continuous improvement of maintenance practices 2  T OTAL L IFE C YCLE S YSTEMS M ANAGEMENT  The Defense Acquisition Guid Sect i on 5.1.1 Total Life Cycle Systems Management, defines TLCSM as the "implementation, management, and oversight, by the designated Program Manager, of all activities associated with the acquisition, development, production, fielding sustainment, and disposal of a DoD weapon or materiel system across its life cycle with reference to DoD Directiv   TLCSM is stated to include, among other imperatives and as a major initiative, the need to consider product support and life cycle logistics in DoD acquisition strategies with enhanced sustainment as a key performance criteria Achieving this goal is expected to yield increased reliability and a reduced logistics footprint with performance-based logistics \(PBL A 2002 article in Program Manager Magazine by Louis A Kratz, Randy T. Fowler and Je rry D emphasis on TLCSM to the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review's \(QDR\focus on transformation of US defense to a capability-based" strategy to repel 21 st Century threats Affordably projecting and sustaining military power anywhere necessary is stated to be one of the top DoD transformation goals and that this requires "dramatic improvements in our sustainment capability to achieve rapidly deployable and employable forces with significant reductions in logistics footprint This publication anticipates revisions to   t o m a ndat e t h e perform ance based logistics as the preferred strategy for sustainment implemented through public-private partnerships employing health monitoring and prognostics to manage defense assets The F/A-18 E/F program is cited as a pioneer in anticipating this mandate, as the first naval aviation platform deployed under a PBL strategy This reference also notes that the subsequent formation of the DoD Joint Logistics Board and its Future Logistics Enterprise led to the determination that Total Life Cycle Systems Management was one of the six initiatives necessary to achieve the sustainment capabilities identified by the 2001 QDR.  These initiatives also include Condition Based Maintenance Plus  \(CBM+\further described below and Enterprise Integration to ensure the "real-time actionable data required to deploy and sustain combat power rapidly with minimal footprint   The synergy of these initiatives in exemplified by the importance given to CBM+ and Enterprise Integration as enablers for TLCSM in providing the necessary information systems, asset state awareness and analysis tools to effectively optimize fleet sustainment activities.  This integration is essential to timely reliability data collection analysis and dissemination as actionable information and guidance to DoD planners, war fighters, maintainers logisticians, program managers and systems engineers.

These define the measures of Operational Availability, Mission Reliability, Cost per Unit of Usage, Logistics Footprint, and Logistics Response Time Review of the definition of these metrics reveals that the first two, Operational Availability and Mission Reliability are derived from data typica lly found in reliability data bases \(RDB\ned TLCSM and variable Cost per Unit of Usage metrics are based on aggregated cost data not usually incorporated in reliability databases, but as discussed below, a subset of the cost data is also relevant and necessary for thorough relia bility centered maintenance RCM\ analysis The two logistics related metrics, Logistics Footprint, and Logistics Response Time, are derived from data not usually considered part of a reliability data base, and might be considered irrelevant to our in terest here.  However, efforts to manage these metrics can be expected to result in increased interest in reliability and maintenance data that would be most readily available from RDB, and possibly changes in the data collected and the analysis of this and other salient data.  Furthermore, the capabilities of the logistics processes employed, and any enhancements, may affect the selection of op timal maintenance processes through RCM and thus the needs for, and usage of, RDB As the DoD moves to an integrated, cross-functional TLCSM process it seems likely that reliability, cost and logistics data will migrate to a common data base to facilitate fully informed and optimal decision making by all parties involved – an issue particularly sensitive in public/private partnerships, notably those governed by PBL In this context the dependa bility, accuracy and timeliness of RDB contents may be criti cal to the effectiveness and viability of PBL arrangements In particular, rather detailed and specific measures of the usage of individual assets and their subsystems and components are likely to be required – data that is central to effective prognostics, and thus RCM and CBM+.  RDB are the most likely hosts for such usage data, information that enables precise component lif ing, meaningful reliability assessments and mission based availability projections The objective of this paper is to examine the roles of reliability data bases in this emerging TLCSM acquisition and operational environment and the requirements and capabilities necessary to support these roles.  The above outline supports the thesis that comprehensive, accurate and timely RDB will increasingly perform a critical supportive and enabling role in the deployment of TLCSM.  The rest of this paper examines this thesis in the context of Condition Based Maintenance Plus d  Reliab ility Cen t ered  Maintenance [RCM   i n cl udi ng t h e appl i cat i on of Prognostic Health Management [PHM  3  C ONDITION B ASED M AINTENANCE P LUS  A draft DoD Instructi  C ondi t i on B a sed M a i n t e nance Plus \(CBM  r Materiel Management, identifies CBM+ as the primary reliability driver in the Total Lice Cycle Systems Management \(TLCSM supportability strategy of the Department of Defense” in concert with Continuous Process Improvement and Performance Driven Outcomes achieved via Performance Based Logistics The Defense Acquisition Guidebook   Sect i on 5.2.1.2  Condition Based Maintenance Plus \(CBM+\provides this definition of CBM+: "a set of maintenance processes and capabilities derived, in large part, from real-time assessment of weapon system conditi on, obtained from embedded sensors and/or external tests and measurements. The goal of CBM+ is to perform as much maintenance as possible at pre-determined trigger even ts. A trigger event can be physical evidence of an impending failure provided either by inspection or diagnostic technology, or could be operating hours completed, elapsed calendar days or other periodically occurring situation \(i.e., classical scheduled maintenance This reference notes that “embedded diagnostics and prognostics to signal the need for maintenance”, preventive maintenance to preempt unscheduled maintenance, and “use of maintenance data analysis that correlates external variables with the requirement to accomplish a maintenance action” are CBM+ “tenets”.  It is notable that adequate RDB incorporating relevant usage data are necessary to all of these capabilities Figure 1 provides an integrated view of CBM+ from a DoD acquisition web site which emphasizes the integration of Condition Based Maintenance and Reliability Centered Maintenance, noting the relevance of integrated data databases and decision support tools.  However, this and other references offer no specifi c details on the role of RDB and RDB analysis tools in implementing CBM

Automatic Identification  plies visibility of weapon system configuration, a key data set for analyzing and projecting weapon system re liability and availability Considering the above, what are the specific contributions RDB can make to CBM+?  On one hand, the described functionality might be impl emented via an autonomous system embedded in the weapon system, possibly with the acquisition of some external tests and measurements, or alternatively incorporating off board maintenance aids However, such architectures with fully dispersed RDB resident in each weapon system - seem unlikely to be the most cost effective Furthermore, the need for "Joint Total Asset Visibility" is evident to approach optim al maintenance and asset management.  Understanding the capability, scheduled maintenance requirements and e xpected availability of each asset is essential to effective and efficient integrated operations and logistics Thus one function for RDB possibly partially distributed but with essential centralized elements, is to enable the acquisition and analysis of aggregated data from individual weapon systems So far this view makes one audacious and unrealistic assumption – that the deployed CBM+ process is fully adequate and satisfactory for the life of the weapon system However, such foresight is hardly to be expected.  Well after OPEVAL we expect to learn much from service experience to refine, mature and enhance equipment maintenance processes and system configuration.  In 


  5 practice, CBM+ depends on dynamic CPI and CIP to approach tolerable system safety, availability and affordability Thus, another role for RDB is the collection & preservation of the data needed to continuously validate and correct expected system and component failure modes and reliability.  The other side of this coin is the need to monitor the effectiveness of the CBM maintenance processes and CBM and PHM sensors, models and analysis tools including the reliability of CBM+ infrastructure and execution Another technology emerging from the implementation of CBM+ and prognostics is particularly relevant to the topic of RDB: more sophisticated measures of sub-system and component usage to supplement the conventional focus on flight cycles and operating hours.  These arise naturally from reliability centered maintenance \(RCM\with its bottom-up approach to preventive maintenance, as subsystem and component failure rates are usually modeled by multi-variate life usage indicators \(LUI Such advanced usage based component lifing may be more expedient and cost effective than diagnostics and prognostics based on embedded sensors and it is enabled by the growing availability of high fidelity models of system behavior and component lives However, the concomitant increase in the volume and comple xity of the data that must be collected, analyzed and possibly archived will have great impact on the size and complex ity of RDB.  And, again RDB will need to support validation and continuous improvement the underlying models of component failure modes and reliability It is clear that expanded RDB data collection and analytical capability is an essential enabler for the deployment of CBM+ within the DoD and a crucial element guiding the enhancement of CBM+ via Continuous Process Improvement \(CPI\ This insight applies not only to future platforms such as F-35, the Joint Strike Fighter, but implies the need to improve the coverage and utilization of RDB for legacy platforms.  The latter will not only improve the maintainability and availability of current aviation assets the lessons learned and tools developed will be crucial to the rapid maturity of CBM+ applied to future systems through operational evaluation \(OPEVAL\ry into service \(EIS Thus the third aspect of RDB usage is the generation and improvement of more generic models of component and system reliability for TLCSM based requirements definition and development of future systems.  In summary RDB should be specified and designed to support three aspects of TLCSM system acquisition and deployment effective and satisfactory CBM+  deployment, the capability to responsively and proactively mature and update the CBM+ process and the weapon system configuration as necessary to achieve TLCSM objectives, and the accumulation of a knowledge base to enhance future TLCSM based acquisitions 4  R ELIABILITY C ENTERED M AINTENANCE  Again referring to a variety of DoD documentation, the following describes the expectations for this element of CBM+.  “At its core, CBM+ is maintenance performed on evidence of need provided by Reliability Centered Maintenance \(RCM\ysis and other enabling processes and technologi   RCM is a logical, structured process used to determine the optimal failure management strategies for any system, based on system reliability characteristics and the intended operating context. RCM defines what must be done to a system to achieve the desired levels of safety, reliability environmental soundness, and operational readiness, at best cost.  RCM is to be applied continuously throughout the life cycle of any system As one of the key enablers of CBM+ and the life cycle sustainment of DoD weapons systems, RCM is conducted to ensure that effective maintenance processes are implemented. RCM provides a logical decision process for determining optimum maintenance approaches and establishes the evidence of need for both reactive and proactive maintenance tasks.” [9 Figure 2, found in a Naval Air Systems Command Management Manual defining guidelines for RCM and many other sources, illustrates the process of RCM definition, implementation and update.  This reference makes evident the essential role of RDB in RCM implementation, providing the information needed to plan and schedule on-condition, hard time 3 failure finding and age exploration tasks, and generate the metrics for RCM program monitoring and evaluation Figure 2 also includes feedback of "in-service data and operator/maintainer input" for two purposes - RCM task evaluation and FMECA analysis – both activities where RDB are essential to collect and retain the necessary information 5  3 Which can be interpreted to include all usage based PM tasks, whether based on flight cycles, operating hour s or more complex component life usage metrics 


  6  Figure 2 RCM Process Map Extracted from   A recent instruction issued by the Commander, Naval Air Systems Command, emphasizes that RCM is a "continuing integrated activity...for maki ng affordable management decisions" as a TLCSM process, and that as such RCM influences design and devel opment requirements, defines the preventive maintenance PM  program for test evaluation and sustainment, updates PM for initial deliveries and subsequent ma jor modifications, and guides maintenance and design improvements throughout production, deployment, operations and sustainment Crucially, RCM is "based on the reliability of the various components, the efficacy of maintenance actions, the severity of the consequences related to safety and mission if failure occurs, and the cost e ffectiveness of the task Again, RDB are the medium for acquisition, retention and dissemination of the information needed for all of these RCM activities and functions.  Thus, the RDB supporting RCM should encompass comprehensive records of equipment and component usage, faults indications and failures \(including safety operational consequences scheduled and unscheduled maintenance actions and their costs and outcomes, and salient operator and maintainer observations 5  P ROGNOSTIC H EALTH M ANAGEMENT PHM Prognostic health management depends on effective measures to detect degradation and impending failure well in advance of any loss of mission capability.  Coupled to dependable tools to model remaining useful life, an essential PHM element, this allows delay of what would otherwise be unscheduled maintenance activity to a scheduled preventive maintenance event, or another convenient time with the least impact on equipment availability and maintenance workload Prognostic health management \(PHM\s a key complement to CBM+ and RCM Condition based maintenance is designed to eliminate unnecessary maintenance, but it also introduces an undesirable element of vari ability into maintenance planning and execution compared to well rationalized hard time maintenance policies.  The unscheduled maintenance needed to correct an impe nding failure detected during inspection or automated fault detection leads to redundant 


  7 maintenance downtime and in creased cost.  As the principles of Six Sigma teach us, variability is the enemy of quality - in this case predictable availability and mission effectiveness.  An effective PHM capability mitigates this uncertainty and recovers the full CBM benefits RCM and PHM have evident synergies.  Both require indepth knowledge of failure modes and effects, with detail understanding of failure probab ility as a function of usage and state – at the individual component level.  PHM adds a valuable option to the menu of available RCM tasks by mitigating the impact of failures on "safety, environment operations and economics" \(Figure 2 Reliability data bases are a critical enabler of PHM.  They are necessary to validate PHM fault-to-failure models and inform ongoing improvement to PHM provisions, which can then be leveraged via RCM to achieve CBM objectives with reduced cost a nd maintenance effort.  This role requires enhanced RDB capabilities and scale to collect and retain the component level reliability information at a granularity in terms of usage and configuration often lacking in current data bases.  PHM also requires tracking and capturing the root cause of on-condition equipment maintenance down through successive levels of maintenance to the component replacement level Greater automation of RDB anal ysis is the key to costeffective RDM support for PHM.  The operational acceptability of PHM depends on low error rates particularly false negatives, which otherwise soon erode PHM's advantages.  Reactiv e and workload intensive engineering investigation is unable to sustain the rapid and early identification and mitigation of emergent and unexpected failure modes \(a fact of life in equipment with operating lives measured in d ecades\aintain PHM dependability 5  S UMMARY   C ONCLUSIONS  NAVAIR Instructi i ssued i n  1989 addresses the need to collect and apply maintenance data generated in flight for "rapid feedback of maintenance and diagnostic data to organizational \(O\ntermediate \(I\and Depot \(D\evel maintenance personnel in the performance of maintenance tasks" and "higher level command reporting requirements" and this imperative clearly extends to data generated during the maintenance process, at all levels Implementation of TLCSM via CBM+ and RCM, enabled by advanced diagnostics and PHM, requires extension of the scope of RDB definition to encompass relevant system and component usage \(including environmental exposure records of operational impacts, and maintenance cost data The primary purpose is informed implementation of CBM and RCM to achieve TLCSM requirements The concept of RDB as the e ssential feedback channel to enable continuous improvement of system maintenance processes and tools, including CBM+ & RCM, for DoD systems is inadequately captured in the references cited and the many others consulted Comprehensive RDB must capture endogenous and exogenous drivers of system and maintenance process performance metrics.  This data, properly analyzed, does more than enable CBM+, it is the foundation for CBM maturation and continuous improvement, improvements to other maintenance processes, component improvement programs   and is necessary to inform TLCSM  throughout the acquisition process Comprehensive and dependable RDB with integrated usage and cost data are a critical element for cost effective performance based logistics \(PBL\ only to enable PBL terms with acceptable risk levels but also to guide the ongoing and effective continuous process improvement CPI\ponent improvement programs \(CIP\hat are fundamental to achieving the expected gains in safety availability and affordability Finally, RDB accumulated through rigorous CBM+ and RCM implementation will provide the basis to define and implement better informed acquisition of new weapon systems to achieve yet higher levels of TLCSM more cost effectively and earlier in the life cycle In sum, the synergy between CBM and RCM that yields CBM+ and sustains deployment of TLCSM is founded on reliability data bases and its full expression is dependent on RDB with enhanced scope and automated analytical capabilities.  RDB are essential to the effective integration of all elements of CBM+  and must be given full consideration in the deployment of TLCSM.  The architecture of CBM+ infrastructure must account for the role of RDB, including their essential role in providing the feedback to guide continuous process improvement and component improvement programs

1mntw d my m the full set of associations we would require up front As a development goal we hoped to minimize the number of model changes up front While we would miss a few key relationships that needed to be added with continued revisions of the model for the most part we over-designed with many more associations than we would really require Figure 6 below depicts the primary relationships that IIS software did take advantage of Figure 6 IIS Scenario Relationship Model Space missions such as MER already incorporate activity into operations however they do not current utilize explicit information models to associate activities with uplink and downlink products IIS Software Development IIS development included graphical user interfaces GUIs for control and visualization Control GUIs acted as ground system and space asset simulations producing uplink directives data measurements health and status and downlink reports as required IIS developed a separate visualization interface to display asset and activity state in real-time All of these components communicated through the same communications interface and information model elements IIS used the space link simulation communications software integrated under ICNI to stand in as space links A set of link objects was generated at the start of the scenario to represent all future communications opportunities Building the primary scenario required a certain amount of infrastructure code to be developed particularly for the management of applications The final scenario used a total of eight running applications these included six asset simulators four NetLanders an Orbiter and an Earth Station a visualization display and a link opportunity generator All of these applications except for the visualization display communicated over the ICNI/SharedNet communications middleware the visualization display was connected to each simulator via sockets to provide real time updates of simulator behavior Despite the large number of interacting applications end-toend integration time was not a significant part of the development cycle Indeed the second failover scenario was developed and integrated in a remarkably short time using the same information model definitions from conception to demonstration the failover scenario was implemented in approximately three days For our first integration attempt we ran the end-to-end system with full connectivity that is we allowed each asset to communicate with any other asset without restriction over the middleware layer We were able to demonstrate the complete science activity i.e from initial directive to final report as well as the failover scenario without significant problems However once we introduced distinct communications windows i.e one link at a time we ran into communications layer delays as the middleware attempted to resolve associations over disconnected links In some cases it would take several orbits to correct if the resolution attempt did not expire first With the large and complex information model it was non-trivial to disconnect unneeded associations that were creating the problem We identified this as an overall problem of coherency breakdown see Figure 8 The system failed to maintain the consistency of information relationships across the network Effectively we would have to tell the system not to resolve relationships over long links until data arrived Note that these coherency problems result primarily from long interstellar latencies Relatively short latencies such as those from a distributed lunar network should not have as great an impact In any case it is an area deserving of further study Figure 8 Breakdown of Information Coherency 9 Coherency of Obect Based Cornmunicahions   I_ _ 1 o  N..a a.BN  IIEIE  _ _ 1 F Of i i s js Apkc_ m _ v _ o__f I u 1be e e   _1 4 _n   


an object-based communications approach with persistent distributed objects is the problem of distributed information coherency Note that these impacts users It is also designed to support message routing along potentially multiple paths and support IIS Development Conclusions First and foremost IIS was able to demonstrate the complex network communications scenario over simulated space links The subscription-driven delivery approach did ensure that the right information would reach the correct consumers and importantly a good deal of intermediate data e.g individual measurement objects was not sent over the final downlink to earth until the report was complete An important finding was determining the low cost of scenario implementation Once the core software and original scenario was implemented a second scenario involving multiple coordinating assets in a failure-mode situation was implemented in a trivial amount of time Development metrics are shown in Figure 7 Figure 7 IIS Development Metrics The primary impact of the more or less mitigate the problems of coherency Again the most important finding of the IIS is that objectbased communications using use of as a CCSDS standard provides capabilities similar to JMS 10 but is designed to operate in resource-challenged environments The primary finding when modifying SharedNet to interface with either communication system was the difficulty in separating the tightly coupled object service layer and the reliable communication layer Given the development resources only partial integrations were attempted We are confident however that a redesign of the object service layer more accurately distilling the object layer from the communication layer would allow those services to be ported to any reliable publish/subscribe mechanism 4 CONCLUSIONS An important finding of the SharedNet development was in determining that the underlying architectural approach was capable of providing high-fidelity communications over complex military network activities With SharedNet in place a range of remote systems shared the same tactical picture of the battlefield environment Also important was the integration interface provided by the common model allowing distributed development across a range of clients leading to successful integration efforts ICNI demonstrated that the communications architecture could be adapted to the space link environment IIS demonstrated that the architecture could support complex network communications scenarios and successfully demonstrated an end-to-end science scenario IIS also exposed the impact of long links on the overall coherency of information across the network Other findings of these studies included the characterization of communications differences between the military and the space network domains The primary difference is in the long light-time across space links as opposed to military domains In the space network environment this was shown to have impacts on management of long distance object references Key similarities between the domains include the high level of network data lossiness and bandwidth restrictions driving the need for priority-driven delivery Avenues offurther study Projected Constellation space network activities involve numbers of interacting ground and space assets working autonomously as well as under partial and direct supervision by ground systems and in-situ astronauts While overall bandwidth may not be as limited as for many SMD missions it must still be considered a commodity in that bandwidth resources are still fundamentally bounded Additionally we must carefully manage the flow of emergency data so that it does not get lost or left behind are largely from long Earth-Mars type links a local planetary Lunar/Mars network will a common information model is capable of managing complex communications scenarios in the space link network environment Work with AMS and DTN Additional research tasks involved replacing the proprietary reliable communication layer developed as part of SharedNet with both the Disruption Tolerant Networking DTN protocol and the Asynchronous Message Service AMS DTN originally developed by DARPA and is also on heterogeneous networks and provide a consistent interface to a variety of QoS criteria for messages The AMS developed by JPL but also submitted a CCSDS standard is designed to overlay 


along the way suggesting that such data should take redundant disconnected paths to its destination Therefore we propose that the activity and network simulation infrastructure be expanded upon to simulate proposed Constellation activities Note that the original model was developed with Constellation in mind This framework would be used to evaluate complex Constellation communications scenarios and develop further required extensions to core information models Ideally the framework would be adapted to utilize space based messaging technologies such as the Delay Tolerant Network DTN With greater numbers of robots producing science and engineering data the problem of managing distribution of data becomes increasingly need-driven of ensuring that the right information gets to the right destination based upon the relative priority of such data Based upon our communications study to date we feel confidant that the proposed architecture of object-based communications built on shared models of information content and relationship is capable of providing systemwide information coherency in the complex space network environment ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The work described in this paper was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration The authors wish to further acknowledge other individuals who made key contributions to research and development including Marti DeMore Lloyd DeForrest Michael Pajevski and Steven Scandore REFERENCES 1 Akyildiz Ian F et al State of the Art in Interplanetary Internet IEEE Communications Magazine July 2004 2 Matijevic J et al Mars Sample Return Spacecraft Systems Architecture IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 2000 3 A.-M Harri et al Network Science Landers For Mars Adv Space Res Vol 23/11 1999 4 Bradley J Clement Steven R Schaffer Distributed Network Scheduling Proceedings of the 4th International NASA Workshop on Planning and Scheduling for Space 2004 5 Gao Jay L Leang Dee A Demand Access Protocol for Space Applications IEEE Aerospace Conference 2007 BIOGRAPHY Dan Allard has worked as a software engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the past 16 years He currently leads the development of core JPL accountability systems applications and infrastructure Other recent work includes the development of a messagebased ground data system for the Mars Science Laboratory as well as research and development of ontology-based distributed communications Joseph Hutcherson is a senior engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory He has been a key figure in the development of the SharedNet since its inception He has also worked on a Java-based adaptation of the Mission Data System control system supported the development and testing of a multi-channel communication system using Iridium satellite phones and most recently developing flight software for a re-usable software and hardware architectural platform 11

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
