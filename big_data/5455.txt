Fig. 5 shows the execution time according to changes in the threshold value of weight when using SYN and UCC data. From this figure, we can see that the execution time is greatly influenced by the threshold values. In contrast, in case of file-level prefetching, the change in threshold value of weight does not give a great effect on the execution time For both SYN and UCC data, when the threshold value is set to 2, the proposed method shows the shortest execution time In case of less than 3 \(i.e., prefetching all \(or most of\e objects belonging to the generated sequential patterns excessive prefetching causes a big increase in the execution time. Conversely, as the threshold value becomes higher than the optimal value, the favorable effect from prefetching decreases gradually V  S UMMARY  In this paper, we have proposed an intelligent two-level prefetching method in which sequential pattern mining is incorporated into the FAST-aware hybrid flash-disk storage system. In our work, the hybrid storage uses the flash memory as a cache space, and we focus on prefetching file or block\objects onto prefetch \(or sequential\og blocks to be accessed in the near future through sequential pattern mining. To achieve the best performance, it is very important to determine optimal values in terms of threshold of pattern weight and the size of training data. To be noted is that the proposed method works at the level of file and block objects   b\In case of SYN data   b\In case of SYN data Figure 5: Effect of changes in weight threshold In contrast, previous studies focused on prefetching block-level objects [1 i t h si m p l e he u r i s t i c s e v e n t h o ugh they cannot be applied to hybrid storage systems. On the whole, the proposed two-level prefetching is more effective than file-level prefetching in UCC and the synthetic data Empirical results show that in terms of the execution time the proposed method improves the I/O performance of hybrid storage by about 16% and 18% for UCC and SYN data, respectively, compared to the Top-N prefetching under the FAST scheme. We submit that two-level prefetching can help to significantly enhance the future commercial hybrid storage products. In the future, we plan to study a way of semi-automatically adjusting several parameters such as the weight threshold and the size of training data for sequential pattern mining A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by the Basic Research Program through the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology \(Grant Number: R01-2007-000-206490  R EFERENCES  1  Hybrid drive: Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_drive 2  S.

After the decision table is constru cted through collecting WSDL interface information, composition process specification, and testing execution information rule extraction algorithm in rough set reasoning is used to find the rules associated with system or service failures.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
