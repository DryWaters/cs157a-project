Many algorithms proposed recently have been motivated by FP-Growth \(Frequent Pattern Growth process and uses an FP-Tree \(Frequent Pattern Tree frequent patterns. This paper introduces an algorithm called FP-Growth-Graph which uses graph instead of tree to arrange the items for mining frequent itemsets. The algorithm contains three main parts. The first is to scan the database only once for generating graph for all item. The second is to prune the non frequent items based on given minimum support threshold and readjust the frequency of edges, and then construct the FP ?raph. The benefit of using graph structure comes in the form of space complexity because graph uses an item as node exactly once rather than two or more times as was done in tree Keywords- Frequent pattern; FP Jrowth; FP_tree FP_graph;, Association rule I. INTRODUCTION Data mining is the process of extracting knowledge from large amount of data. Data mining involves an integration of techniques from multiple disciplines such as database and data warehouse technology, statistics, machine learning association rule mining, high-performance computing 


pattern recognition, neural networks, data visualization information retrieval, image and signal processing and spatial or temporal data analysis. Association rule learning is a method for discovering interesting relations between datasets in large databases. Based on the concept of strong rules, Agrawal [2] introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by Point of sale \(POS supermarkets. Association rule mining comprises of two steps for the complete process. First step finds the frequent itemsets from given transaction database and second step generates rule using these frequent itemsets. Frequent pattern mining is an important part in the data mining tasks R.Srikant proposed the classical algorithm called Apriori[I that used the generate-and-test approach to find all frequent patterns. According to the property of Apriori, many like Apriori algorithms had been proposed, but all algorithms had the bottle-neck that generating many candidates. In order to solve this problem, Han jia-wei proposed the FP ?rowth[lO algorithm based on FP _tree that used the compressed FP _tree structure to store the frequent patterns and did not generate candidates. But constructing the FP _tree need to 978-1-4244-7578-0/$26.00  2010 IEEE 309 scan the database twice, and the time for constructing FP _tree needs much time. Jun Gao [6] proposed a new association rule mining algorithm called MFP\(modified FP Growth database into an MFP _tree through scanning the database only once, and then do the mining of the tree. All algorithms based on FP Growth process uses tree for arranging the items before mining, where more than one node can contain single item. This causes repetition of same item and needs more space to store many copies of same item In this paper we designed an algorithm which uses graph for arranging items before mining. The benefit of using graph is that there be only one node for an item. This requires less memory. Section I of this paper gives introduction to association rule mining and related algorithms. Section II explains the principle of Graph based algorithm. Section III shows the algorithms to implement the algorithm. Section IV explains experiment and implementation and Section V show experiment result 


II PRINCIPLE OF GRAPH BASED ALGORITHM A. Related Definition [4J Definition I: Transaction database: Transaction database stores transaction records. Every transaction record in a transaction database has a sole identifier and all items included in the transaction record are listed in order. Fig. I is a simple transaction database named D. TOOl is the identifier of the first transaction record in D Definition 2: FP _Graph: FP _Graph consists of nodes and edges. Number of node in the graph is equal to number of distinct items in the database D. Each node is associated with a value count which stores the number of occurrence of item in D and a Boolean value which is used while pruning graph It is set if corresponding node is frequent otherwise it is reset. Each edge in graph contains three values marked on it First value represents the frequency of edge, second value is the name of node with which the concerned transaction has been started and third value represents the number of nodes we have traversed to reach the destination of this edge including destination. All these three values are written on each edge as shown in Fig. 3 2010 International Conference on Networking and Information Technology Definition 3: FI: It stands for Frequent Itemset. It is a data structure used to store Frequent Itemsets found while mining graph. It simply stores an itemset and prints it and then another itemset is over written in it B. Theprinciple ofFP_GRAPH This algorithm can be divided into three parts: In first part we make graph for given database D. In second part graph is pruned to remove all non-frequent nodes and readjusting the frequencies of edges connected to it. In third part frequent itemsets are mined from pruned graph of second part 1 This is the first part of algorithm which explains the formation of graph for transaction database. As shown in Fig. 2 each edge in graph contains three values marked on it We start with first transaction of database and we take first item of transaction and make a node with this item name and set its count to 1. Then we make node for second item and draw an edge between these two nodes. Each time we create a chain of nodes in one transaction, the value of node count 


is increased by one for the successive edges of graph While making graph for TOO 1 in database we create node A and B and then draw an edge between them and mark it with 1, A 2. Now create a node E and link B with E by an edge marked with 1, A, 3. For T002, as we have created node B, we create a node D and link it with B by an edge marked with 1, B, 2 Now for T004 as we have created both A and B and edge between them, we just increase the frequency of link between them by one. This process continues till all transactions of database. Fig. 2 shows the graph generated for our transaction database in Fig. 1 TId. List of"n?lDs 100 1 A,B,E 1002.

While pruning graph if direct edge exists between two frequent nodes, then edge is kept intact and if one or more infrequent nodes connects two frequent nodes. We remove all infrequent node and connect the frequent node with edge by which first infrequent node of sequence was connected with source frequent node. Further we check if an edge with same start node and node count exist we just increase the frequency of this edge. As in pruned graph, node count of any edge can not be more than 


number of frequent node , we readjust the node count of all edges. As shown in Fig. 3 where node C and F are frequent node and node D and E are not frequent. After pruning when node D is removed node C is directly connected by an edge 1, A, 3 with F and when E is removed, C is connected to F by an edge 1, A, 3, but as an edge with 1, A, 3 already exists between C and F. we just change the frequency and mark it with 2, A, 3. A direct edge between C and F with 1, A, 4 is kept intact. After pruning the graph is shown in Fig. 4 C 1----- 1,A,3 ---0 1. A. 3 ---.\(DJ 1,A,4 1,A,4 1.A.4 Picture 3: Pruning Graph 2010 International Conference on Networking and Information Technology Picture 4: Pruning Graph 3 Third part of algorithm explains the mining process of graph. In this process we try to find out biggest group of items that appears number of times more than minimum support count. First we find the edge with highest value of node count and traverse all nodes along the path from destination of edge found to start node of edge. We traverse all nodes of the path by finding an edge with destination equals to source of current edge and same start node and node count one less than the current edge. This process continues till the start node and source of current node are same. The frequency of the path is minimum value of frequency of all edges along the path. If the frequency of path is more than or equals to minimum support count, all node of the path comprises of frequent itemset and if it is not, we search another path in which this sequence may occur. If no such path exists we start mining for other smaller groups III PROPOSED ALGORITHM Pointer first and previous store the first node of transaction Ti and source of any edge respectively and syntax of create_edge \( source, destination, frequency_count start_node, nd_count node_name make?rapb\(database D  For \(All transaction Ti in database D

The Mushroom and Connect datasets are real data which are dense in long frequent patterns. These datasets were downloaded from http://fimi.cs.helsnki.fi/testdata.htmland and http://miles.cnuce.cnr.it/::palmeri/datamlDCIIdataset.php Some characteristics of these data sets are shown in Fig. 5 and we compared these algorithms with their implementations. They were compiled in Visual C++. This paper focuses on algorithmic concepts rather than on implementations. For the above algorithms, the total processing time, Data base scanning and accessibility and Number of transactions is different for different implementations. The memory are used frequently, the memory refreshment also effectively handled using pointer

The elements in the datasets which are represented in the numeric format easy to evaluate the processes, which involved in those mining concepts. These datasets consists of frequent itemset in each record level. In record level they are separated by special identification. The elements are separated by space The original values of Mushroom and Connect datasets observations represented by its index values using mining concepts. The frequent items and its associative datasets are easy to calculate and represented as a flat file \(or The dataset which are used for the evaluation contains following characteristics [3]. The Mushroom dataset is a parse data relatively connect dataset with short frequent Itemset patterns. Thus nodes in the itemset tree will have small tails and few branches.

Charactenstlc of expenment data sets B. Factor involve in t his experiment From the observation of identified factors from the above frequent itemset mining algorithm 4 factors are taken in this paper and criticized. The 4 factors are 1. Total processing time \(run time reading time of a dataset, sorting time, reordering time 312 pruning time, FP tree construction time and frequent item set manipulation time 2. Data base scanning and accessibility: It gives how many times the dataset is opened or scanned and the each element is accessed 3. Number of transactions: The occurrence frequency of an itemset is the number of transactions that contain the itemset 4. Total page fault 


V RESULT AND CONCLUSION Under large minimum supports, FP-Growth runs faster than FP-Graph while running slower under large minimum supports. Fig 6 and 8 show what minimum support used in experiments. Both algorithms adopts a divide and conquer approach to decompose the mining problem into a set of smaller problems and uses the frequent pattern \(FP-tree and \(FP-graph representation of the database transactions. Under large minimum supports, resulting tree and graph in relatively small size so with this condition FP-Graph does not take advantages of small memory space and also page fault for both algorithm is almost equal. But as minimum supports decrease resulting data structure size rapidly increase, it require more memory space , at this point advantage of FP Graph come in existence with less page fault FP-Graph considerable work well with high dense database along with s!llall minimum supports, it shown in Fig. 6 and 8 . Response time FP Growth tree good but total run time for large database, FP-Graph good because it gives less page fault. FP Growth Tree uses tree for arranging the items before mining where more than one node can contain single item. This causes repetition of same item and needs more space to store many copies of same item. It also cause more page fault When the dataset is large, it is unrealistic to construct a main memory based FP _tree.. In FP-growth-based algorithms recursive construction of the FP-tree affects the algorithm's performance.
