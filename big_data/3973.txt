I I NTRODUCTION  Location based Web services have become popular among Internet users, who can leave reviews, or ètipsê, for venues they visit. Unlike edited expert reviews, which may be structured according to comprehensive, consistent and objective checklists of features, user contributed reviews are generally short texts reflecting the èperceptionê or èfeelingê of a place usually accompanied by a rating \(stars\. The aim of this research is to capture this underlying èfeelingê of a place, or personality of a venue, in a way related to personality research in human psychology. This representation of a place that 
depicts it as a projection of \(different\ usersê perceptions is in line with the notion of èsense of placeê, which emphasises the characteristics that make a geographical location special or unique from a human point of view [1 Personality research in psychology is based on the so-called 
lexical hypothesis 
stating that the personality characteristics that are most important in peoples' lives will eventually become a part of their language, and that more important personality characteristics are more likely to be encoded into language as a single word. The lexical hypothesis was invoked to derive five broad domains or dimensions of personality where personality descriptors of individuals cluster together 
af ter f a ct o r an a l y s is. Dim en sio n s o f  th is Fiv e F act o r  Mo d e l  FFM\ also called èBig 5ê personality traits, are usually represented by roman numerals \(I-V\ For mnemonic purposes the acronym OCEAN is also used. OCEAN stands for descriptions of the five dimensions as 
Openness Conscientiousness Extraversion Agreeableness Neuroticism 
inventive or curious vs. consistent or cautious efficient or organized vs. easy-going or careless  outgoing or energetic vs. solitary or reserved  friendly or compassionate vs. cold or unkind\ and  sensitive or nervous vs. secure or confident\cording to the 
FFM, everyoneês personality can be described with some level of confidence along these dimensions The research presented here assumes that venues can also be described using human personality dimensions, due to the personality of the individuals that frequent the venue, or because of characteristics of the venues. This usage is also embedded in language, which sometimes uses the same vocabulary to describe place and human personality. For example an çartyé place is expected to have a higher Openness O\ value than a çtraditionalé pub. A nightclub would be expected to score high on Extraversion \(E\hile a çquiet coffee place should score lower on that personality dimension An accurate qualification of venues according to their 
personality should provide insight for better place recommendation, as well as constitute a step towards the computational capture of the èsense of place The approach presented here is based on reviews collected from location based Web services. Reviews are parsed and matched to adjectives characteristic of personality trait dimensions. A human experiment is presented which is used as proof of concept as well as ground truth for the automatic generation of venue personality values. The next section presents related work in the fields of personality research, place recommendation and opinion mining. Section III presents the personality related adjectives and results of previous personality research, which are used for venue characterisation 
Section IV describes the experimental setting used to acquire data on venue personality from participants, and the results of a survey. It then presents the automated extraction approach using reviews. Finally Section V concludes and describes future work II

Opinion mining is concerned with applying computational methods for the detection and measurement of  and in text [2 Par ticu l ar ly  sen tim en t  analysis is concerned with the automated detection of negative or positive sentiment in natural text, while affective computing is concerned with the detection of human emotions such as fear, anger or humour. In both cases, the dimensions of interest are different from the ones studied in this research. Moreover sentiment analysis applied to venues through reviews may be seen as redundant, since the review score already conveys a positive or negative judgment. This research may therefore be considered as an extension of sentiment analysis to additional dimensions of psychological interest Beside humans, personality traits research has been applied to non-human animal  T o t h e be st o f  o u r kno w l e d ge, t h i s  constitutes the only extension of personality traits research beyond human personality, with no attempts towards other realms such as everyday objects, buildings or places. The research presented here applies personality research to geographic entities. If extending personality traits theory to non-living structures may be controversial, as it could be argued it only applies in a metaphorical way, it also constitutes a new field of investigation potentially useful to future place recommender systems Tourism recommender systems have been developed to suggest venues personalized according to the user querying the system. Such venues can be generic points of interest restaurants/cafes, or hotels \(see [4 o r a s u rv ey  o w e v e r t h e criteria used for recommendation can be described as  such as and as opposed to personality related recommendation. The present work can use the personality of a user \(a to recommend the venue most adapted to his or her psychological profile. Beyond tourism with the advent of mobile devices and location based services that can monitor our geographical positions in real time or at regular check points \(ècheck-insê\, mobile and online services related to places are even more popular. They have evolved from an initial adaptation of online maps and navigators towards services more oriented to provide reviews and personalised recommendations such as Yelp 1 and Qype 2 to others that combine location and user mobility with a social networking component, for example Foursquare 3 Flickr 4 and Google+ Local 5 These services have evolved towards a place representation that is more related to the individual needs of users, regardless of his tourism or business needs, with users being at a particular location at a particular time often making use of tags, annotations and other user generated content which in turn informs recommendation [5   Use r g e n e r a te d c o n t en t  in  the form of reviews, is used in this research to extract the personality of places    1  http://www.yelp.co.uk  2  http://www.qype.co.uk  3  https://foursquare.com  4  http://www.flickr.com  5  http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/local  III K EYWORD E XTRACTION  We follow a èbag of wordsê approach in which both venues and personality dimensions are represented by unigrams individual words\ Unigrams describing places are extracted from online sources providing reviews for those places, while keywords \(adjectives\epresenting dimensions of personality are gathered from psychology literature [6 T h e n e xt se ct i ons describe the extraction and organisation of the data Reviews of venues are extracted from various location services using their respective APIs, or through text èscraping techniques. The sources used for review extraction are    and  Review text was stripped of punctuation and stopwords uncapitalised, and part of speech \(POS\agged to filter verbs and adverbs. A negation detection algorithm is applied to the list of words to tag adjectives used in a negative sense. The algorithm is a modified version of the one presented in itself inspired by NegEx [7  T h e  alg o rith m  w a s m o d i f i e d  t o  ignore so called such as introduced by 'no increase', 'no wonder', 'no change', 'not cause', 'not only', 'not necessarily'\ because they were resulting in too many false positive in the reviews corpus. Also ènothingê was added to the so-called set used by the algorithm, in order to identify sentences such as çthereês nothing special or exciting aboutÉé as negatives Here we describe the inventory of personality adjectives presented by Saucier and Goldberg in  T h e fi na l 435 adjective inventory was obtained in their work by annotating personality related adjectives with familiarity ratings, in order to filter out the least familiar English trait personality descriptors. The resulting list of familiar adjectives was then used in that study to characterise the personality of a large sample of individuals \(N=899\. Following principal component analysis Saucier and Goldberg identified five clusters corresponding to five personality dimensions. Correlation scores for a selection of adjectives are given in TABLE I The mapping between dimensions I to V and the OCEAN traits characterisation is given in TABLE II.  IV is usually inversed to represent neuroticism \(IV-\, i.e. high on IV corresponds to low emotional stability. Following this correspondence, the adjective strongly correlates 0.38\ with the OCEAN A dimension \(Agreeableness\ as well as with C \(Conscientiousness\t 0.25, while also correlates with A \(0.37\ but even more with E \(Extraversion with 0.39 as well as negatively \(-0.17\ with N \(Neuroticism and Openness \(-0.16 IV MATCHING  APPROACH To assign dimensions of personality to a venue, terms obtained from the review extraction that we performed were matched to the list of familiar personality adjectives.

of the Saucier and Goldberg familiar personality adjectives that was relevant to the type of the venue. In the following sections we describe the human experiment followed by the automated matching approach TABLE I The experiment consisted of an annotation task where participants were asked to qualify known venues with adjectives. The task consisted of two steps. In a first step, for each venue, the participants were asked to state whether or not they knew the venue and have visited it. In a second step participants were asked to select adjectives relevant to the venues they knew, from a presented set. The following subsections describe the places chosen, the presented set of adjectives, the experimental setting, the matching approach and results  12 venues were selected in Cardiff, Wales, UK according to the following criteria selected venues had reviews from at least two Web sources the places were divided into 4 categories, or types, with and 3 venues of each type in each category not all venues had the same characteristics we selected venues that were most likely known to the participants The chosen venues, accompanied with a brief description are listed in TABLE III TABLE III  In order to limit the human effort required to complete the task, the list of 435 familiar personality adjectives was filtered according to common collocations extracted from the Google books corpus available from Collocations were mined for adjectives preceding a type name, i.e. one of Then the resulting list of adjectives was matched to the 435 familiar adjectives For reasons of sense ambiguity some lists of correlations were larger than others, with keywords not immediately relevant to geographic venues. For example the type had adjectives such as or not immediately related to a dancing club or a nightclub, but probably more to a club as a group of individuals. Some participants complained about these terms as well as for the lack of negative terms in some cases. However, no manual filtering was done on the matched adjectives in order to preserve the objective nature of the task. The selected subset of adjectives for each type, as well as descriptive statistics regarding the correlations of the set of adjectives to personality dimensions, are presented in TABLE IV The minimum and maximum correlation for every dimension as well as the mean indicate the range of choice offered to the participant for a venue of a given type. In a few cases, such as for the category the range on dimension II Agreeableness\ does not allow for negative values. This is a limitation of the experiment, which may however reflect the fact that most venues tend to favour agreeableness, and that in reviews and other place descriptions, from which collocations are extracted, agreeableness terms are overrepresented  21 anonymous participants with knowledge of Cardiff completed the survey. Each venue was known by an average of 11.75 participants, each participant knowing an average of 6.71 venues. To address the small number of participants for some venues we used Wilsonês statistical score interval to estimate the number of checks for an adjective with 85% probability and selected only adjectives checked by at least 20% of participants

Therefore, the full list of familiar adjectives was used, rather than type correlated adjectives, and keywords were stemmed to encourage more matches The negation algorithm is applied to venues keywords, to obtain a negation marker \(1 or -1\or each term. Venues keywords extracted from reviews as well as familiar adjectives are stemmed using the Porter stemmer. Stemmed review terms are then matched to the list of 435 stemmed familiar adjectives In case of a match, the correlation values of the matching adjective is added, possibly negated if a negation has been detected.

It provides both an experimental approach of venue personality annotation by human subjects, as well as an automated venue personality extraction approach based on reviews We demonstrated that reviews provide a reliable source of personality related adjectives, matching human evaluation in several aspects, notably the main personality dimension of a venue and the range of personality values. Further work includes extending and modifying the evaluation approach, a better handling of negation, and possibly an evaluation using personality tests of users of the venue A larger scale evaluation of the automated approach is needed, requiring more human experiment samples. The principal difficulty for such an evaluation is that participants are required to have knowledge of the venue. A possibility to explore is to distribute questionnaires in a venue, which would ensure the punters already know the place. This outreach effort could be combined with the administration of a FFM personality test for every respondent. The adjective list for every venue could be adapted by using negatives or a Likert scale for each, which will ensure a wider range of personality is available for a type of venue Further work on the improvement of the negation detection algorithm would increase the quality of the automated results However it is unclear whether negation detection algorithms exist which could accurately address the examples presented above A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research has been funded by RECOGNITION grant 257756, an EC - FP7 Future Emerging Technologies project concerning Self-Awareness in Autonomic Systems.

Compute resources Benchmarks Local cluster studies    
           
 Map- or Shuffle-intensive applications run on a large cluster To verify our analyses empirically, we measured seven benchmark MapReduce applications on two cloud platforms Ñ a local cluster and an Amazon EC2 cloud and evaluated the fit of thei r execution times to a powerlaw regression function of cluster size Our local cluster comprised a dedicated, 14-host IBM BladeCenter H with identical hardware and software configurations on each physical machine.  We configured the BladeCenter with VMware vSphere 4.1 and a VMware ESXi 4.1 hypervisor.  Each VM employed two v-CPUs and 2 GBs RAM and had two locally-connected 300GB, SAS disks.  Each VM ran 64-bit Fedora 13 Apache Hadoop 0.20.2, and Sun/Oracleês JDK 1.6 Update 20.  To test cluster-size scaling efficiency, we deployed up to 32 VMs on the blades The public cloud employed varied numbers of standard and homogeneous instances on Amazon's EC2 cloud.  Each VM was an instance with 1.7 GB of memory, 1 EC2 Compute Unit \(one virtual core and one EC2 Compute Unit These 32-bit platforms deployed on Ubuntu AMI, with EBS boot, and Amazon EC2 AMI Tools.  As in the local cluster, each VM ran Ap ache Hadoop and Sun/Oracleês SDK.  We used Apache W up to 64 VM instances on demand.  All the VM instances were run within a single EC2 zone We used the following applications, spanning Map and Shuffle-intensive processing, as benchmarks 1 WordCount is a typical Map-intensive application with combiner enabled by default.  Shuffled data size is less than 0.1% of the input dataset, which is normally generated from a Random Text Writer function using a fixed-size database 2 The Sort application is more Shuffle- than Mapintensive.  Map simply passes input data and Shuffle moves it all to the Reduce process.  The input dataset is the same size as for WordCount 3 Random Text Writer \(RTW Reduce-less application that generates input data set for WordCount 4 Inverted Index\(II\ents as input and generates word-to-document mapping 5 Term-Vector \(TV\, typically used to evaluate a hostês relevance to a particular search, determines the most frequent words in a set of documents 6 Grep, a generic search tool used in many data analyses, searches for a target pattern within a file 7 Pi Estimation \(PE\ is another Map-intensive application but involves no HDFS I/O in Map.  The Map function itself generates all the data it uses and in separate runs to estimate the value of Pi, samples 10 6   10 7 10 8 and 10 9 points Sort is a Shuffle-intensive application while the rest are all Map-intensive.  Input datasets are all real Wikipedia webpages.  For the first six benchmarks, the input data sizes are 0.5G, 1G 2G, 4G, and 8G on the local cluster, and 4G, 8G, 16G, a nd 32G on Amazon EC2.  An average of four experimental runs of each application is given as performance data Due to space limitations, we here show four benchmark experiments in local cluster runs and five in EC2 runs.  As the only shuffle intensive application, Sort appears in both contexts Figure 6 plots the coefficient of determination  for the MapReduce applications tested on our local cluster and the abscissa enumerates VM counts values corresponding to each combination.  We discuss here how each of these lower- and upper-bound pairs affects goodness-of-fit to power-law execution time under cluster-size scaling In Figure 6\(a\ost of the R 2 values exceed 0.9 suggesting a power-law di stribution of execution time in those cases.  The exception is the 0.5GB line 2 32 s represent the minimum input dataset \(0.5GB 32 VMs\his typical display of the large-scale over-provisioning implies th e 32-VM cluster size is more than enough for the input data size Figure 6\(b\ilarly illustrates a large-scale limitation.  The difference here is that even the smallest input dataset \(10 6 points high The minimum value is above 0.93, which again occurs with the \(8, 32 indicates that the large-s cale over-provisioning arises later than in Figure 6\(a\nd beyond the value corresponding to c = 32 In Figure 6\(c and 1GB lines exhibit a larger variance in values than other lines, implying that those input datasets ar e too small to yield powerlaw scaling gains values generally improve typically exceeding 0.8, with larger cluster-sizes and larger input datasets.  Fo r example, the 8GB line's  values are all above 0.9 The first three applications are Map-intensive and so do not encounter the smallscale limitation, although

Again, this situation is more likely when proce ssing small datasets \(0.5GB and 1GB provisioning.  In cases where however, even a large input dataset fails to yield high For example, in the clustersize range \(1,4\ith 8GB input falls almost to zero

Starting with a small cluster size 1\apintensive benchmarks of Figures 7   values \(> 0.9 cate good fit with a power-law distribution.  This observation confirms that Map-intensive applications, as predicted in section 4.B, do not encounter a small-scale limitation At the other cluster-size extreme, all these applications show degraded values as gets large.  Again, such behaviors illustrate a large-scale over-provisioning Figures 7\(e-g\educe-intensive application Sort.  In Figure 7\(e 1  values are consistently lower than in Figure 7  7\(g begins at 4 values are all above 0.9 Again, this observation confirms our section 4.B analysis of Reduce-intensive cases MapReduce is an easily parallelizable framework within which, for certain applications and conditions simply increasing compute re sources yields scalable performance.  This paper describes an initial effort to characterize those applications and investigate how their execution times scale with cluster size.  A major conclusion is the observation of the segm ented power-law distribution of the execution time in MapReduce applications The benchmark MapReduce applications discussed here all demonstrate power-l aw performance within the scaling bounds and Our results can help users identify the scaling range of power-law behavior As our Map-intensive data suggest, those applications do not suffer from small-s cale limitations, and lower bound values for them start from a cluster of one VM.  For Shuffle-intensive applications, however, appropriate lower bounds depend on the application:  The more Shuffleintensive, the larger the lower-bound value required Therefore, bound candidates should be profiled using a varied small cluster size, e.g one, two, four VMs, etc. to determine the scaling start point where a large can be observed For a certain volume of input data size, we can always allocate a large pool of comput e resources, sufficient to far exceed actual processing needs.  The large-scale overprovisioning, therefore, potentially constrains all MapReduce applications. The value depends on factors such as tolerance to degradation of relative computing intensity between Map and Reduce phases, input dataset size, the number of Map and Reduce tasks and hardware configuration of each compute VM.  This complexity points to the need for a more genera l model that can address this many-to-one mapping problem

B.Future work 
 
  
 Future work includes studying more MapReduce applications, with larger cluster sizes, on both public and private clouds and investigating how to extend our analytic framework to a wider range of real-world applications Meanwhile, other validation methods of the segmented power-law distribution other th an evaluating the regression coefficient, e. g. likelihood ratio test, should also be further investigated Furthermore, we intend to delve more deeply into determining the lower-bound cluster size where power-law conformity begins in typical S huffle-intensive applications Finally, we are developing a prediction method, based on power-law behavior that will show its effectiveness in very large clusters and with more complex MapReduce applications.  We will follow this work by proposing a series of data-cleaning and noise-filtering methods to minimize prediction errors This publication was made possible by NPRP grant 091116-1-172 from the Qatar National Research Fund \(a member of Qatar Foundation the responsibility of the authors

Furthermore, because knowledge of the contents of the SM is unknown, the wall thickness was varied from 10.8 g cm 2 to 5.40 g cm 2 2 cm 16.2 g cm 2 6 cm\, and 27 g cm 2 10 cm\ investigate the influence that wall thickness has on the particle flux environment inside the module. A spectrum of wall thicknesses was chosen because the true shielding geometries are not known. Even though this results in a different total mass of the SM, this variation provided a means to assess the effects of local shielding on the simulated dose rates. The complex geometry tested in this work is illustrated in Figure 16 and is designed to closely mimic the true geometry of the ISS around the SM. It is intended to provide a means to assess the influence that adjacent modules may have on the particle flux environment inside the SM. Using this complex geometry, comparisons were made against simulations of the simple geometry at solar minimum conditions and for wall thicknesses of 5.4 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2  4.4 \226 Transport Simulations Transport calculations were performed using the threedimensional Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System PHITS\ This is a general purpose Monte Carlo code that has been developed jointly between researchers at the Research Organization for Information Science and Technology \(RIST\ Atomic Energy Agency \(JAEA High Energy Accelerator Research Organization \(KEK Japan, and Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden 18,44 PH I T S h a s been des i g n e d w i t h t h e s p eci f i c pu rpose of accurately transporting heavy ions at high energies through complex shielding and geometries. The code permits the transport of neutrons \(from thermal energies up to 200 GeV\adrons, heavy-nuclei, and muons \(each from 1 keV up to 100 GeV/nuc\d electrons, positrons, and photons \(for energies ranging from 1 keV up to 1 GeV 44  W ith reg a rd s to th e ap p licatio n o f P HIT S to sp ace  radiation dosimetry, this code has been successfully used in simulating the European Matroshka experiment and the Russian Matroshka-R experiment [37,38,44,45,4   The basic simulation setup is to place the simple cylinder representation of the ISS at the center of a spherical source that is 50 m in diameter. The source input is isotropically distributed within this source sphere. Outside the cylinder the environment is setup to be a perfect vacuum while inside the cylinder, the environment is composed of air at a density of 0.001292 g cm 3 For the simulations with the complex geometry, the spherical source is increased to 100 m diameter to accommodate the additional size. In all simulations, the minimum energy allowed for protons neutrons, pions, muons, kaons, deuterons, tritons, alpha particles, and heavy ions is set to 1 keV. Below this energy the particles are no longer transported. For electrons positrons, and photons, the minimum energy that PHITS will track is 1 MeV; this is a function of the version of PHITS being used. Furthermore, for these latter three particles, the maximum energies are set at 1000 MeV, 1000 MeV and 100000 MeV, respectively. Neutrons are transported from thermal energies up to 200 GeV. Below 20 MeV, neutrons are transported using the ENDF Evaluated Nuclear Data Library [47,48 o r p rot on s an d n e u t rons up to 3 GeV, the JENDL-HE library was used [50,51 A ll simulations have been performed on the High Performance Computing Virtual Laboratory \(HPCVL\per computer cluster located at Queen\222s University in Canada 4.5 \226 Simple Geometry Results Figure 17 illustrates the simulated proton, neutron, and alpha particle flux distributions inside the simple cylinder model of the ISS for incident GCR and TR sources at solar maximum conditions. This is representative of the flux distribution that would be obtained for solar minimum conditions as well   Figure 17. Differenti al flux distribution of protons neutrons, and alpha particles due to GCR \(dashed line and trapped protons \(solid lines\ at solar maximum incident on a simple cylinde r representation of the ISS with varying aluminum wall thicknesses of 5.40 g cm 2 10.8 g cm 2 16.2 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2  As shown in Figure 17, the neutron flux distribution inside the simple ISS model is seen to increase with the shielding thickness. This is observed for both TR- and GCR-induced neutron distributions. The TR-induced proton flux distribution, in contrast, is seen to fall off with increased shielding thickness and similar behavior is also seen for the alpha particle distributions. In contrast, the GCR-induced proton and alpha particle flux distributions are observed to exhibit a different trend. At low energies, below approximately 2000 MeV nuc 1 the GCR-induced proton flux distribution is seen to increase with wall thickness while beyond this energy range, it decreases. The GCR induced alpha distribution behaves similarly, however the transition occurs at approximately 10 MeV nuc 1 rather than at 2000 MeV nuc 1 These observed behaviors are attributed to the variations in incident energies between TR and GCR sources

As the thickest shielding studied in this work is 10 cm, it follows then that the lower energies of the incident trapped proton spectra are most affected Additionally, although the incident trapped proton spectra reach energies of up to approximately 600 MeV, the majority of the spectra are dominated by low energy protons and are thus strongly attenuated by the shielding Essentially, the increased shielding thickness has the effect of hardening the incident proton flux distribution. This result also helps explain the significant localized shielding dependencies observed in the TR model development Comparatively, the GCR spectrum includes heavy ions that reach well above GeV energies. Consequently, GCR ions can undergo spallation and fragmentation with the aluminum shielding resulting in the ejection of large amounts of nucleons and lighter ions. All these secondary particles will have energies lower than the primary incident ions but that are still quite large. In addition to this is the sheer abundance of heavy ions present in the primary and secondary flux distributions. With increasing wall thicknesses, the likelihood of spallation, fragmentation, and other resonance effects increases as well. These processes favor the increase in proton and alpha particle fluxes at low energies with thicker shielding. Above the transition points the various flux distributions decrease with increasing wall thickness suggesting they are populated by a combination of high-energy incident protons and alpha particles that penetrate through the shielding as well as heavy ions that release secondary protons and alpha particles. These fluxes will fall off, however, with the shielding thickness as the likelihood of penetration decreases Overall, when the GCR- and TR-induced distributions are summed together, the neutron component and proton component dominate the flux distribution at low energies At higher energies, the protons represent the dominant contributor to the total dose. Furthermore, at very high energies, alpha particles start to become more dominant than neutrons and their abundance becomes comparable to that of the protons. Table 6 and Table 7 detail the calculated ambient dose equivalent rates, effective dose equivalent rates and E/H  10\ios for trapped protons and GCR ions at solar maximum and minimum conditions, and for the four wall thicknesses As is detailed in Table 6, the simulated TR-induced daily ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates decrease with increasing wall thickness. The simulated values are also smaller at solar maximum conditions relative to solar minimum as expected. Next, it is useful to benchmark the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates against the TEPC dose equivalent measurements collected in 2000 and 2009 to verify the assumption that H TEPC  is approximately H  10\d moreover, to verify that the first order approximation provided by Eq. \(9\ is reasonable. The year 2000 coincides with solar maximum conditions and during this time, the ISS orbited at an altitude of 372 km to 396 km. In contrast, the year 2009 represents solar minimum conditions and the ISS orbited at an altitude of 340 km to 380 km. The measured TEPC daily dose equivalent rates at the location of Service Module Panel 327 SM-327\ged between 0.15 \226 0.2 mSv d 1 in 2000 and 0.2 \226 0.3 mSv d 1 in 2009. Comparatively, for solar maximum conditions, the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates were found to be as low as 0.094 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2  to as high as 0.42 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 hese simulated values are within a factor of two of the measured values Similarly, at solar minimum conditions, the simulated results ranged from 0.14 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 wall thickness\ 0.85 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 wall thickness\hich 


14   are again within the range of measured results, though the thinnest shielding results in a slightly more conservative estimate that is within a factor of 3. It is thus noted that a change in wall thickness does have a significant influence on the TR-induced doses. While it is unclear which of the results best approximates the ISS shielding, it is argued that the upper and lower limits of the shielding thicknesses used provide representative limits of the expected dose The simulated TR-induced effective dose equivalent rate determined by Sato et al 53 a t so l a r  mi ni mu m c o nd i t i o n s   for a wall thickness of 5.56 cm \(15 g cm 2 uminum, was estimated to be 0.144 mSv d 1 In that study, fluence-toeffective dose equivalent conversion factors for all heavy ions were used. To compare, at 10.8 g cm 2 in our study the simulated effective dose equivalent was determined to be 0.187 mSv d 1 For a wall thickness of 16.2 g cm 2 the effective dose equivalent rate was determined to be 0.127 mSv d 1 These simulated values are in good agreement with the values presented by Sato et al  d i n di cat e s t h at  the majority of the effective dose equivalent due to TR exposure is reasonably estimated considering only the neutron, proton, and alpha particle contributions. The simulated ratios of E  H  10\uctuate from 0.41 up to 0.51 for solar maximum conditions and 0.35 to 0.48 for solar minimum conditions. This ratio also appears to fall off with decreasing wall thickness. Overall, the latter results suggest that for TR exposures, the TEPC measured ambient dose equivalent offers a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent Unlike the daily TR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates, the predicted GCR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates increase with increasing wall thickness Table 7\This results due to the increased neutron, proton and alpha particle flux distributions at low energies. As expected, the daily ambient dose equivalent rates and effective dose equivalent rates are again smaller at solar maximum conditions as compared to solar minimum conditions. The measured GCR dose equivalent values in 2000 and 2009 are on the order of 300 to 400 \265Sv d 1 and 400 to 500 \265Sv d 1 respectively. In comparison, the simulated values range from 60 \265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 8 265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar maximum conditions and 100 265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 o 206 \265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar minimum conditions. These predicted values underestimate the measured ones by more than a factor of two. This can be attributed to the exclusion of the heavy-ion contributions Moreover, these results also suggest that as an operational quantity, the ambient dose equivalent is not well suited for high-energy heavy ions. This observation has also been previously suggested by Pelliccioni h o i n di cat ed t h a t  a depth greater than 10 mm would be more appropriate for higher-energy radiation and that no single depth is appropriate for all heavy ions Sato et al  o calcu late d th e eff ect iv e dos e equiv ale nt rate from GCR exposures \(including heavy ions\for a wall thickness of 15.0 g cm 2 Al to be 0.21 mSv d 1 At solar minimum conditions, the simulated effective dose equivalent rates in this study are found to be 0.13 mSv d 1  and 0.15 mSv d 1 for wall thicknesses of 10.8 g cm 2 and 16.2 g cm 2 respectively. As was the case earlier, there is again a slight discrepancy regards to those published by Sato et al 53 attrib u t ed to th e ex clu s io n o f th e h e a v y io n s   It was shown by Sato [53 th at th e co n t rib u tio n to t h e cumulative effective dose equivalent from both iron nuclei and pions are each nearly as much as the contribution alpha particles. Despite these underestimations, from the current simulations the ratios of effective-to-ambient dose equivalent are relatively constant between solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. Furthermore, unlike TR exposures, the ratios decrease from 1.19 to 0.84 with increasing shielding thickness. These results suggest that the ambient dose equivalent is roughly a 1:1 estimate of the effective dose equivalent for GCR exposures, depending on which wall thickness is assumed. However, it is again noted that the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates are underestimated so these ratios should fall below one These latter conclusions can also be verified in another manner. The total effective dose equivalent estimated by Sato et al 53 in sid e th e ISS at so lar m i n i m u m co n d itio n s   was determined to be 0.37 mSv d 1 The total dose equivalent from TR and GCR exposures measured with the TEPC at SM-327 during solar minimum conditions \(2009 is approximately 0.6 \226 0.8 mSv d 1 The ratio of the effective dose equivalent predicted by Sato to these measured TEPC values results in an effective-to-TEPC dose equivalent conversion factor of E  H TEPC of 0.5 to 0.6. This again shows that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent and can be used as an appropriate surrogate protection quantity. This conclusion is applicable to solar maximum conditions as it was shown in the simulation results that for TR exposures the E  H  10\ios are only slightly higher at solar maximum conditions and essentially remain unchanged for GCR exposures from solar maximum to solar minimum 4.6 \226 Complex Geometry Results The above transport simulations at solar minimum conditions and for wall thicknesses of 5.4 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2 were repeated using the complex geometry shown in Figure 16. Rather than determining the flux inside the entire SM, the flux distribution within the crew quarter \(SM-CQ was examined only. This area best approximates the location of SM-327. When compared to the simple cylinder simulations, the complex geometry is shown to have no effect on the simulated E  H  10\version ratios but does influence the observed ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates. The simulated values for trapped exposures are largely unchanged while for GCR exposures, the complex geometry results in a factor of two increase due to the build-up effect. Specifically, at a wall thickness of 5.4 g cm 2 the simulated ambient and effective 


15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
