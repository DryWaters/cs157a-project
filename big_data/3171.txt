Selecting candidate features terms ii calculating a relevance score for each feature candidate term 1 and iii identifying feature terms from the candidate feature terms based on the relevance scores 1 Candidate Feature Term Selection The heuristics used to select the candidate feature terms identify base noun phrases according to the following patterns Base Noun Phrase BNP This pattern restricts the candidate feature terms to one of the following patterns NN NN NN JJ NN NN NN NN JJ NN NN JJ JJ NN  where NN and JJ are nouns and adjectives De\002nite Base Noun Phrase dBNP This pattern restricts candidate feature terms to de\002nite base noun phrases which are noun phrases  BNP  preceded by the de\002nite article the  Beginning De\002nite Base Noun Phrase bBNP bBNP s are dBNP s at the beginning of a sentence followed by a verb phrase 2 Relevance Scoring The feature weighting algorithm applied in is based on the Lik elihood Ratio test 5 Likelihood Ratio Test Let D  be a collection of documents dealing with a topic T and D 000 a collection of documents not about T  A BNP is a candidate feature term occuring in D   The likelihood ratio 000 2 log 025 is then de\002ned as 000 2 log 025   000 2 003 lr if r 2  r 1 0 if r 2 025 r 1 1 r 1  C 11 C 11  C 12  r 2  C 21 C 21  C 22 r  C 11  C 21 C 11  C 12  C 21  C 22 lr   C 11  C 21  log r    C 12  C 22  log\(1 000 r  000 C 11 log r 1  000 C 12 log\(1 000 r 1  000 C 21 log r 2  000 C 22 log\(1 000 r 2  C 11 to C 22 are de\002ned in Table 3 Table 3 Counting a BN P D  D 000 BN P C 11 C 12 BN P C 21 C 22 The higher the value of 000 2 log 025  the higher the likelihood that the BNP is relevant to the topic T  1 Yi et al compute the relevance scores using the Likelihood Ratio Test  and the Mixture Model method Since the Likelihood Ratio Test consistently outperformed the Mixture Model method we focus on the former one in the present study 3 Feature Identi\002cation For each BNP  we compute the likelihood ratio score 000 2 log 025  as de\002ned in Equation 1 Then we sort the BNP s in decreasing order of their likelihood score Feature terms are BNP s whose likelihood ratios satisfy a prede\002ned con\002dence level Alternatively the top n BNP s can be selected 3.2 Association Mining Approach The goal of the work by Hu and Liu is to automatically create summaries of customer reviews Hu  Liu assume that the product features appear as nouns and that the opinions about these features are expressed by adjectives A distinction is made between so called frequent features ff and infrequent features iff  Frequent features appear in several documents while infrequent features are commented on less often 1 Identifying Frequent Features and Feature Sets Association mining is emplo yed in order to e xtract the frequent features  The association mining algorithm calculates the probability that certain features or feature sets occur in the review document collection for a certain product Candidate terms for both kinds of features are nouns only The nouns occurring in a sentence are used to create a so called transaction set  The transaction sets from all reviews of a certain product are input to the association mining algorithm A certain feature or feature set is considered frequent if its minimum support is larger than an empirically de\002ned threshold of 1 Minimum support is de\002ned as the minimum percentage of transaction sets that contain all of the features listed in that association rule Since association mining does not consider the position of the terms in sentences two pruning steps are applied The 002rst pruning step is called compactness pruning  It removes frequent feature sets ffs in which the individual terms do not occur within a distance of three or less words in two or more sentences of the document collection The second pruning step called redundancy pruning removes ff or ffs which are complete subsets of other ffs  if the subset does not occur by itself in three or more sentences 2 Identifying Opinions Identifying opinions about the product features follows a lexicon based approach Based on previous work on the correlation of subjectivity and the presence of adjectives in sentences 3 opinion words are assumed to be adjectives The lexicon of opinion words is created by crawling WordNet starting from seed adjectives see Table 4 By crawling synonyms and antonyms of the seed adjectives in WordNet we create a list with 99 positively and 111 negatively oriented adjectives

we are interested in identifying product features irrespectively of the opinion expressed we base the evaluation on the revised annotation scheme only 4.2.1 Document Collection Level Evaluation In the document collection level evaluation the algorithms extract a list of distinct features from the entire document collection of product reviews.Columns 5 and 6 of Table 6 present the results obtained with the dBNP-L method which outperforms the BNP-L and bBNP-L methods This is different from what has been reported in where the best performance was obtained with the bBNP-L method Precision values are substantially higher than recall values with an average of 80 precision and 10 recall For the collection of digital camera reviews which yielded best results in precision of 100 we achie v ed an a v erage precision of 80 and 16 recall Columns 3 and 4 of Table 6 give the results yielded by the Association Mining approach We observe that both average recall and precision values are fairly low Recall is rather low since the association mining always fails to correctly extract certain features due to the threshold employed or due to the pruning steps Precision is low due to the fact that the association mining algorithm is not capable of distinguishing between the correct nouns related to the current product and the nouns belonging to the general vocabulary 4.2.2 Instance Level Evaluation Since an evaluation on the product speci\002c document collection is targeted at extracting a summary of product features which does not take into account the frequency of individual features being discussed we also conduct an instance level evaluation For each sentence we compare the annotated feature\(s to the feature\(s extracted by the algorithms Table 7 columns 3 and 4 present the results of the Likelihood Ratio Test algorithm based on different con\002gurations described in Section 3.1 The best recall values are always achieved with the BNP-L method while the precision is higher with the dBNP-L method except for the MP3 documents where the highest precision is achieved with the bBNP-L method Table 8 columns 3 to 8 present the results obtained with the Association Mining approach Columns 9 and 10 display the results obtained with the Likelihood Test approach  dBNP-L  We observe that in the instance level evaluation the recall values of the association mining algorithm are considerably higher compared to the document collection level evaluation while the precision is moderately lower For the Likelihood Ratio Test algorithm the tendency to higher recall and lower precision is also observed with recall improving by 9 and precision decreasing by 12 Table 7 Instance level results for different Likelihood Ratio Test methods Results with and without subsequence similarity SsS Without SsS With SsS Recall Precision Recall Precision DC1 BNP-L 0.456 0.618 0.495 0.671 dBNP-L 0.256 0.798 0.271 0.846 bBNP-L 0.039 0.719 0.044 0.812 DC2 BNP-L 0.323 0.590 0.347 0.634 dBNP-L 0.156 0.776 0.159 0.791 bBNP-L 0.024 0.533 0.039 0.867 CP BNP-L 0.406 0.583 0.459 0.659 dBNP-L 0.197 0.742 0.212 0.798 bBNP-L 0.043 0.667 0.049 0.767 MP3 BNP-L 0.364 0.302 0.408 0.339 dBNP-L 0.254 0.473 0.263 0.490 bBNP-L 0.061 0.596 0.072 0.702 DVD BNP-L 0.165 0.344 0.243 0.506 dBNP-L 0.107 0.647 0.132 0.800 bBNP-L 0.016 0.571 0.021 0.786 4.2.3 Comparison of the Evaluation Strategies In the document collection level evaluation it does not matter from which sentence and document an algorithm extracts a certain feature it is important that the feature is found at least once The total number of targeted features is considerably lower than in the instance level evaluation and therefore the decrease in recall is in turn higher if an algorithm fails to extract a certain feature Comparing the results of the two evaluation methods however indicates that these problematic features seem to occur rather seldomly throughout the entire document collection since the average recall of the instance level evaluation is higher than the recall of the document collection level evaluation 4.3 Error Analysis In this section we analyze the sources of errors identi\002ed in the output of the algorithms Table 10 gives a classi\002cation of the errors of both algorithms for the DC1 document collection Table 9 lists the top 20 features terms extracted from the DC1 customer reviews by the two algorithms Some of these terms like nikon coolpix week work are wrongly classi\002ed by the Likelihood Ratio Test approach as product features The association mining algorithm falsely extracts week box way work as product features A discussion of error sources associated with the Likelihood Ratio Test approach is done in Section 4.3.1 in Section 4.3.2 we analyze the errors of the Association Mining approach and in Section 4.3.3 we compare the two approaches

association mining The Likelihood Ratio Test fails to extract features also belonging to common vocabulary and it makes the extraction dependent on the feature position in the sentence leading to low recall The dBNP and bBNP based methods yield low recall due to the fact that the product features do not occur with the article the in front of them very often The Association Mining approach returns all frequent nouns which decreases precision Our results suggest that the choice of algorithm to use depends on the targeted dataset If it consists of mainly on-topic content the results of Table 10 indicate that the Association Mining algorithm is better suited for this task due to its high recall If the dataset consists of a mixture of onand off-topic content our results suggest that the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm would perform better due to its ability to distinguish and 002lter out the off-topic features For future work we plan to extend the Likelihood Ratio Test methods especially the dBNP based approach by other determiners such as a or this  which should increase the recall of this method Another possibility which we will investigate regards the BNP patterns The current Likelihood Ratio Test approach is not capable of dealing with discontinuous feature phrases for example in 5 the quality of the pictures is great the feature would be picture quality  This problem could be addressed by introducing wildcards in the BNP patterns We will also investigate whether there are any methods in order to calculate an optimal threshold for the candidate feature extraction in order to increase the recall of the Likelihood Ratio Test based algorithm We plan to investigate whether a deeper linguistic analysis e.g with a dependency parser can improve the feature

a frequency constraint and according to the structure of the dataset These proposals are all based on a global analytical model i.e an interesting approach that needs however to develop complex and speci\036c models As a result they cannot be easily extended to handle complex conjunctions of constraints to incorporate different symbol distributions or different semantics for pattern occurrences To the best of our knowledge no method has been proposed to estimate the number of patterns satisfying a constraint while avoiding to develop a global analytical model Our approach requires only to know how to compute for a given pattern its probability to satisfy the constraint this can be obtained in many situations and it remains ef\036cient in practice by adopting a pattern space sampling scheme 6 Conclusion Using constraints to specify subjective interestingness issues and to support actionable pattern discovery has become popular Constraint-based mining techniques are now well studied for many pattern domains but one of the bottlenecks for using them within Knowledge Discovery processes is the extraction parameter tuning This is especially true in the context of differential mining where domain knowledge is used to provide different datasets to support the search of truly interesting patterns From a user perspective a simple approach would be to get graphics that depict the extraction landscape i.e the number of extracted patterns for many points in the parameter space We developed an ef\036cient technique based on pattern space sampling that provides an estimate on the number of extracted patterns This has been applied to non trivial substring pattern mining tasks and we demonstrated by means of many experiments that the technique is effective It provides reasonable estimates given execution times that enable to probe a large number of points in the parameter space Notice that domain knowledge is also exploited here when selecting the distribution model Future directions of work include to adapt the approach to other pattern domains and to different constraints Another interesting aspect to investigate is the use of more sophisticated sampling schemes e.g that could b e incorporated in the approach when more complex syntactical constraints are handled e.g a grammar to specify the shape of the patterns Acknowledgments This work is partly funded by EU contract IQ FP6-516169 Inductive Queries for Mining Patterns and Models and by the French contract ANR-MDCO14 Bingo2 Knowledge Discovery For and By Inductive Queries We thank Dr Olivier Gandrillon from the Center for Molecular and Cellular Genetics CNRS UMR 5534 who provided the DNA promoter sequences References  J F  Boulicaut L De Raedt and H  M annila e ditors Constraint-Based Mining and Inductive Databases  volume 3848 of LNCS  Springer 2005  C  B resson C K e ime C F a ure Y  Letrillard M  B arbado S San\036lippo N Benhra O Gandrillon and S GoninGiraud Large-scale analysis by SAGE revealed new mechanisms of v-erba oncogene action BMC Genomics  8\(390 2007  L  C ao and C  Z hang Domain-dri v e n actionable kno wledge discovery in the real world In Proceedings PAKDDÕ06 volume 3918 of LNCS  pages 821830 Springer 2006  G  D ong and J  L i Ef 036cient mining of emer ging patterns discovering trends and differences In Proceedings ACM SIGKDDÕ99  pages 4352 1999  F  Geerts B  G oethals and J  V  d en Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans on Database Systems  30\(2 2005  U  K eich and P  A  P e vzner  S ubtle motifs de\036ning the limits of motif 036nding algorithms Bioinformatics  18\(10 2002  S  K ramer  L De Raedt and C  Helma M olecular f eature mining in HIV data In Proceedings KDDÕ01  pages 136 143 2001  L  L hote F  Rioult and A  S oulet A v e rage number of frequent closed patterns in bernouilli and markovian databases In Proceedings IEEE ICDMÕ05  pages 713716 2005  I  M itasiunaite a nd J.-F  B oulicaut Looking for monotonicity properties of a similarity constraint on sequences In Proceedings of ACM SACÕ06 Data Mining  pages 546552 2006  I Mitasiunaite and J F  Boulicaut Introducing s oftness i nto inductive queries on string databases In Databases and Information Systems IV  pages 117132 IOS Press 2007  I Mitasiunaite C Rigotti S Schicklin L  M e yniel J F  Boulicaut and O Gandrillon Extracting signature motifs from promoter sets of differentially expressed genes Technical report LIRIS CNRS UMR 5205 INSA Lyon France 2008 23 pages Submitted  G Ramesh W  M aniatty  a nd M J Zaki F easible itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proceedings ACM PODSÕ03  pages 284295 2003  F  Zelezn  y Ef\036cient sampling in relational feature spaces In Proceedings ILPÕ05  volume 3625 of LNCS  pages 397 413 Springer 2005
