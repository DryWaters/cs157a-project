partitions of attribute domains which are meaningful for a user a procedure is described which enables data sommaries involving fumy qonntifiers to be built by compoting fuzzy cardinalities. The difference between this new type of fuzzy summary and previous proposals is also pointed out I INTRODUCT~ON During the last years the number and volume of databases have tremendously increased and the need for extracting some condensed information has received attention The related research area, called knowledge discovery in databases KDD or data mining aims at the discovery of useful information from large collections of data The discovered knowledge can be NI~S describing properties of data frequently occurring pat terns, clusterings of the objects in the database etc Among 
the recent works, a great deal of attention has been paid to the dis covery of a specific ype of rules called association rules I Association rules are of the type when the properties A and B are satisfied iu the data, then properly C is also satisfied". Let us give a simple formalization of the problem Given a schema R  A  4 of attributes with respective domains D  D a relation r can be represented by a Boolean matrix in which a row corresponds to a tuple and a column to an attribute value An association rule ahout r is an expression of the form X 3 B where X C R and B E R  
X The intuitive meaning of the rule is that if a row of the matrix r has a 1 in each column ofX then the row tends to have a 1 also in column B This semantics is captured by the measures of frequency or support and confidence. Given W C R we denote by sup\(W r the frequency of W in r the fraction of rows that have a 1 in each column of W The frequency of the rule X 3 B in r is dcfined to be sup\(X U B r and the confidence ofthe rule is sup\(X U B r X r In the discovery of association rules the task 
is to find all rules X  B such that the frequency of the rule is at least equal to a given threshold a and the confidence of the rule reaches at Cedex 4  France least another threshold 8 In other words one wants to obtain rules that are sufficiently frequent and valid As stated by R Yager 2 the use of fuzzy logic seems parti cularly interesting in the context of howledge discovery inas much as it allows to express properties about the current content of a database as statements of the natural language thus provi ding knowledge that can be easily understood by nonexperts In this paper we propose an extension of the notion of an associa 
tion rule, based on the aggregation of sufficiently close data into fuzzy sets and un the use of fuzzy cardinalities The paper is organized into two main sections Section 2 pre sents the notion of a fuzzy association rule based on fuzzy car dinalities Section 3 describes an aggregation procedure which is performed on a non fuzzy relational database It aims at re placing the initial database by a fuzzy relational database which summarizes it This summarization is made in terms of labels of fuzzy partitions of the attribute domains which are supposed to he given and to he meaningful for the user This aggregation procedure is augmented with the computation ofthe fuzzy car 
dinalities of the sets of items to which a given fwzy label in a cell of the new relation is applicable Section 4 describes how it should he possible to generate linguistic summaries of interest in the form of hrzzy association rules om the summarized fuzzy relational database built in the previous section and the associated fizzy cardinalities 11 FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES BASBD ON FUZZY CARDINAUTLES The starting point is to aggregate sufficiently close data into fuzzy sets on the basis of fuzzy partitions which are meaningful for a user. Another key idea is to view fuzzy sets as a way for describing the different possible labellings that can be made by a user for borderline data A Notaliom 
Let R he a non fuzzy relation involving attributes A 8 C _ In fact we assume that the user is interested in possible summa ries association rules involving a given subset of attributes We only consider the projection of R on this subset and for notational simplicity we use a 3 element subset ofattribute say A B and C in the following which is sufficiently general for discussing the main issues Let ai b ct denote a tuple of R\(4 6 C projected on attri butes A B and C Let DA Ds Dc he the amihute domains We 0-7803-7293-W01/$17.00 0 2001 IEEE 461 2001 I International Fuzzy Systems Conference 


assume that each domain is equipped with a fuzzy partition Al Az _.,A BI Bz  B3 C Cz  C respectively Each fuzzy set in a partition is assumed to be normalized Each parti tion is ordered and a fuzy sef say Ai can only overlap with its predecessor Ai or its successor Ai+l when they exist We Mer assume that a finite scale with m  1 levels is used for assessing the membership degrees namely 1  a  _  urn  0 Each level corresponds to a different possible un derstanding of  as the crisp level cut A The use of a finite scale then greatly facilitates the computation of fuzy cardinalities as it is shown in the following without being a serious limitation in practice B Principle The approach corresponds to a straightforward extension of the usual def~tion of an association rule Its principle is the following: the validity of the rule A Ar B Bs depends on the number of tuples which are on the one hand and on the number of tuples which are Ar and B on the other hand For instance, using scalar cardinalities, the validity of the de A AJ  B B can he defined as which is nothing but a straightforward extension of the usual definition of the confidence Remark 1 It is worth noticing that the principle consisting in i rewriting the data by means of a more general vocabulary and ii trying to discover properties in the rewritten database has also been advocated in a nonfuzy context". For instance in 3 the authors use a hierarchy of Boolean concepts in order to rewrite" a relation so as to discover different types of rules See also 4 where the notion of a generalized association rule is introduced. Nevertheless the fact of using linguistic labels i.e fuzzy sets to rewite the data allows to discover more robust rules The key point with a fuzzy partition is that the borderline data are taken into account in each of the two classes which decreases the sensitivity to the boundaries Remark 2 In accordance with the linguistic nature of such an extended association rule it is also possible to interpret the notion of validity in a flexible way which corresponds to inho ducing some tolerance and considering that a rule can be seen as perfectly valid even though the ratio confidence\above is strictly less than 1 The association rule obtained is then a fuzzy quantified proposition of the form Q tuples of R that are A are also B where Q denotes a fuzzy quantifier such as most of The general principle described above has been advocated by Yager 2 and more recently by Kacpnyk 5 These authors use scalar relative cardinalities to compute the degree of vali dity of a summary i.e of a fuzzy association rule Scalar fuzzy cardinality which amounts to the addition of membership degrees, considers a collection of several elements with small membership grades whose sum is 1 as equivalent to one ele ment with full membership for instance this might be debatable or even misleading hm a user point of view In this paper we present an alternative fuzzy approach based on the use of fuzzy cardinalities This approach constitutes an extension of those described in 6,7 111 SUMMARIZING A RELATION From the relation R restricted to A B and C we build a new relation &,\(for R summarized by a procedure involving two main steps which are now described The idea is to perform a kind of information compression A 7k labelling step ples of fuzzy sets  B CJ subject to the constraint For each tuple a bj cd we replace it by one or several tu Thus ai bj cd may be replaced by one tuple Ar B Cd if all the three degrees of membership are equal to I or by several up to Z3  8 in case one or several of the element\(s\in the tuple belong to two fuzzy sets For instance if A  I B  0.8 Bs+l@j  0.2 CL  0.6 CLCL  0.4 we give birth to the tuples Ar 0.8/B O.6/C,.1 AC ONB 0.4  0.2/BS+1 O.6/&.1 Ar 0.2/8,+1 0.4/C3 where we keep track of the membership degrees A stands for I/AJ This corresponds to all the possible readings" of the tuple ai bj cd in terms of the vocabulary provided by the iiuzy partitions In a data mining contexf it is not necessary to store the summarized relation  The only additional data that have to be stored are the fuzzy cardinalities whose computation is described in the following subsection B Fusion step and computatioo of cardinalities We want to how bow many tuples tom R are 4 are B are G are Ar and B _ are Ar and B and  and this for all the fuzzy labels In order to have a more accurate representation of the relation fuzzy cardinalities are used instead of scalar ones It is then necessaxy to compute the different cardinalities related to each linguistic label and to the diverse conjunctive comhina tions of these labels All the tuples of the form x/A y/B dCt which are identical with respect to the three labels are fused into one tuple A B q of  At the same time we compute the cardinalities Fq FQ FA FB FQ is a fuzzy set defined on the integers O I   which represents the fuzzy number of tuples which are somewhat Ar resp B Cl Ar and B A and Ct B and Cl Ar and B and q and which are fused into the considered tuple for all the combinations of labels appearing in at least one Each cardinality is computed incrementally in the following FB Fc FA,B FA FB,c Fq,c ere FA rev FB Fc tuple of way At the beginning FA  UO Let FA 1/0    l/n-I  I/n  hl/\(n+l  _  n+k  O/\(n+k+l  __ he the current value of the fuuy cardinality FA with 1  hl  t hk   0 and n t 0 k  0 Let us recall that this expres 462 


sion represents a cardinality that possibly equals at least n to degree 1 and possibly equals at least n+k to degree h E Let us consider a new tuple whose A value re~tes Ar Let x be the degree attached to Ar in this tuple FA must then be modified If x  1 FA becomes 1/0  l/n I/\(n+l n+2  hk/\(n+k+l  O/\(n+k+2  _  If x  1  there are two cases. Either 3 i x  hi or not If 3 i x  h  hi then FA is modified into U0  _  Iin-l  l/n  hl/\(n+l  _  A,/\(n+i t n+i+l    hk/\(n+k+l  O/\(n+k+2  _  Otherwise 3 j 4  x  I we assume that becomes  I and FA

computation of FAr \(resp FE et Fc one takes into account the value x resp y the degree related to B and z the degree related to q the computation of F+B resp FAA FB~c and F~B~c takes into account the value min\(x y resp min\(x 2 mino z min\(x y z thus reflecting the fact that the tuple to fuse is both A and B resp Ar and G B and G A and B and C Let us notice that the maximum number of tuples that can be obtained in  is na 8 nb  nc i.e the product of the numbers of labels appearing in the considered partitions Thus the summarized relation can be significantly smaller than the original relation R for large relations IV COMPUTINGTHB VALIDITY OF A SUMMARY Fuzy cardinalities computed as explained in Section 3 can be used to evaluate the validity of fuzzy association rules In this approach we assume that the user indicates the attributes A B or C that he/sbe is interested in Two general forms of rules can be thought of The fust type of rule follows the pattern Q tuples of R are Ar and B where Q denotes a linguistic quanti fier such as most of or few This can be seen as a kind of degenerated rule with no attribute involved in the antecedent The validity of such a rule corresponds to the extent to which the set of labels A B is fiequent \(if Q  most of or scarce if Q  few in the sense of 9 The second type of rule corresponds to the pattern a proportion Q of tuples which are A in R are also B The computation of the validity of the rule in each case is discussed in the following A Computing/izzy relative cardinalities The two types of rules presented above relate to proportions It will thus be necessary to compute fuzzy relative cardinalities Let us denote by FR resp FRq FRy c the fuzzy pro porUon of the tuples of R which are A esp Ar and B s Ac and B and C This fuzzy number is obtained by dividing each \(more or less\possible cardinality appearing in Fq resp Fp Fqs by the number of tuples in R or mstance the fuzzy relative cardinality FRQs represen ting the fuzzy proportion of elements in R which are both Ar and B is obtained by replacing FQ  110    I/n    n+i  with FRq  110    l/\(n/K   Aj/\(\(n+i  where K denotes the number of tuples in R This means that the proportion of elements which are A and B at level h is at least equal to n+i Thus the support of the fuzzy set FRq is included in the unit interval B Frequent and scarce sefs of linguistic labels Let us fmt consider the case where the user does not specify any fuzzy quantifier From the tuples in it is possible to produce summaries of the form A B c q~q or relative to projections of R such as A B FRqS As in the nonfuzzy case one produces the frequency, which IS now a fuzzy number Of course these summaries will be given to the user in a li guistic form expressing the variability of the cardinality the fuzzy cardinality is then described by some proportions obtai ned for different levels of possibility Let us recall that these levels of possibility corresponds to the more or less elastic interpretations that can be associated with the linguistic labels involved in the summary Let us now consider the more general case where the user is interested in a summary such as Q tuples of R are Ar or AT and B or Ar and B and C where Q denotes a predefined and possibly fuzzy quantifier Q The validity of a smry as Q tuples of R are C can be defined as a degree expressing the extent to which we are cer tain that Q tuples of R satisfy the fuzzy property C For ins tance the validity of most of the tuples in R are A et B can be defined as the necessity of the fuzzy event most of with respect to the possibility dislribution FRq It is equal to  rn t o 11 m\(Q\(4 1  F"~p$u which is nothing but a degree of inclusion of FR in Q This validity degree expresses the extent to which the propor tion FRq is close to 1 in the sense of Q This degree can equal 1 ody if all the possible values in the proportion FR are totally compatible with the representation of Q When validity is less than 1 but is stricly positive one can inform the user that the summary is rather true and specify the value of the nonfuzzy threshold k such that the assertion at least k  of the tuples are A et B is certain \(whatever the interpretation of the linguistic labels  inside the limits of their supports C Fuzzy association rules Let us now consider a fuuy association rule of the form the tuples in R which are A are also B We have available the fuzzy number of tuples in R which are Ar and B8 on the one band, and the fuzzy number of tuples which are Ar on the other band Several approaches can be thought of for instance  by analogy with the nonfUzzy case and with the approach based on scalar cardinality of fuzzy sets it is possible to 463 


compute the fuzzy quotient p  Fe I F enforcing the constraint that the fuzzy number Fe reshicts a value which is less than or equal to the value restricted by Fb see 191 However this quotient of such two fuzzy numbers may lead to a tw imprecise result  a more interesting approach consists in determining how the proportion of tuples which are A and BJa with respect to those which are A changes when a varies i.e de pends or not a lot on the interpretation of the linguistic la bels according to whether they are reduced to their cores or extended to their supports Then the computation involves three steps 1 for each a appearing in F4 or FM 1.1 determine l\(AJm1 and I\(&B which can be di rectly read on the ruZy cardinalities wmputed as explained in section IILB 1.2 compute c  I\(ltB I  corresponding to the confidence value of the rule when the a-level cut is used to interpret the labels 2 compute p\221 as the wnvex hull of the fuzzy number   alc    lk Given a confidence threshold 0 specified by the user it is then possible to determine the highest degree a such that p\221 2 6 The association rule can then be expressed in a linguis tic way, inasmuch as the a-cuts of A and B can be expres sed in a linguistic way too This approach in terms of a level cuts of the cardinalities is m the spirit of IO althougb these authors compute scalar cardinalities as weighted ave rages of cardinalities of a-cuts It is also possible to use a fuzzy quantifier Q e.g., most of in order to qualify the rule The validity of the rule can then be defmed as the necessity of the fuzzy event Q relatively to the possibility distribution p\222 It is equal to E O 11 l4$u 1  P\222W which is nothing but the inclusion degree of p\222 in the quantifier Q This validity degree evaluates the extent to which the fuzzy proportion p\222 is close to 1 in the sense of the fuzzy quantifier V CONCLUSION This paper has outlined a new approach to the linguistic summarization of data bases The basic ideas are i to use fuzzy partitions of attribute domains which are meaningful for the user \(since fuzzy partitions are more compatible with a linguis tic labelling ii to perform a 223soft compression\223 of the data base and then to exploit it for evaluating potential summaries iii this evaluation is made by computing fuzzy cardinalities dch account for the possible variations of the interpetatioo of the labels What is obtained are the \(fuzzily known proportions of elements satisfying fuzzy specifications Strictly speaking the association rules obtained should not be confused with fuzzy rules which are also of interest for buil ding other kinds of summaries For instance, checking if in a non-fuzzy database a gradual rule holds between two attributes say A and 8 of the form 223the more the A-value is A the more the 8-value is B\224 is not a matter of counting. Indeed if we as sume that some fuzzy set A of DA is given it amounts to rank ordering the pairs ai bi according to the increasing values of the A\(aJs and to looking for a 221B belonging to some fuzzy label vocabulary, such that A\(q 5 B@i for all i if it is feasi ble An approach aiming at discovering such extended associa tion rules based on dual rules is described in I I It is quite clear that the present work is in a preliminary stage and that the approach still needs to be studied in more detail In pdcular it will be necessary to test it against a sutliciently large database in order to assess the clarity and the relevance of the results obtained The design of optimization techniques aiming at reducing the complexity of the discovery process is also a matter of great impomce that should be dealt with in future works REFERENCES I R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami 223Mining as sociation rules between sets of items in large databases\224 Proc ACMSIGMOD\22293 1993 pp 207-216 2 RR Yager, \223Database discovery using fuzzy sets\224 Int J ofInlelligentSys1 11\(9 1996 pp 691-712 3 1 Han and Y Fu, \223Discovery of multiple-level association rules from large databases\224 ProC VZDB\22295 1995 pp 42043 1 4 R Srikant and R Agrawal 223Mining generalized as sociation rules\224 Proc VZDB\22195 1995 pp 407419 5 J Kacprzyk 223Fuzzy logic for linguistic summarization of databa.ses\224,Proc FUZsIEEE\22299 1999 pp 813-818 6 D Dubois and H Prade 221Tuzzy sets in data summaries  Outlime of a new approach\224 Proc IPMU\222OO 2000 pp 1035-1040 7 P Bosc D Dubois 0 Pivert, and H.

Then, for cluster C1 shown in Figure 3\(a nodes marked gray are the purchased items of TID 10 and the corresponding categories in the taxon omy tree, and they are identified as large nodes Similarly for cluster CI shown in Figure 3\(b nodes marked gray are large In Figure 3 the count of each node is illustrated nearby For example Count\(g C is 1 and Count\(g Cz is 0 In Step 2 algorithm CBA first allocates TID 30 to clus ter CZ because H\(30 CZ  a\(l  0  f i.e the link number of item y to categoly F plus the link number of item ztocategolyE 30,C1  1+1  1 Similarly TlDs 40,50,60,90 and 120 are allocated to clus Figure 4 In Step 2 algorithm CBA reads each transaction sequentially and allocates it to the cluster with the minimum category-based adherence ter C1 which is shown in Figure 4\(a TlDs 30,70 80 100 and 1 IO are allocated to cluster Cz which is shown in Fig ure 4\(b Then algorithm CBA derives S,\(C  3 and S,\(Cz  3 hy S  IC11  0.5  6  3 and S  IC21  0.5+6  3 respectively. Because Count\(g Cl  S,\(C category A is identified as a large node in cluster C1 and marked gray In Step 3 algorithm CBA proceeds to itera tion 2 In iteration 2 two transactions TID 50 and TID 70 are moved TID 50 is moved from cluster CI to cluster CZ because H\(50,C1  f\(O  2  2    H\(50,Cz  2  1  0  1 and TID 70 is moved from cluster Cz to cluster Cl due the H\(70 C  f\(l  1  0  f  H\(70,Cz  2+0+l  1 Then algorithmCBA iden tifies the large nodes again In iteration 3 only one trans action TID 100 is moved from cluster Cz to cluster C In iteration 4 there is no movement and thus algorithm CBA proceeds to Step 4 The final feature trees for the clustes are shown in Figure 5 Note that a transaction at item level may not be similar to any cluster For example TID 10 g x and TID 40 h z have no common items, hut item g and item h have common categoly B and item x and item z have common categoly E Thus TID IO is similar to TID 40 in the high level concept By taking category-based adherence mea 550 


Figure 5 In Step 4 algorithm CBA generates the clustering U1 surement many transactions may not be taken as outliers if we take categorical relationships of items into considera tion In addition, transactions at the item level may have the same similarities in different clusters However by sum marizing the similarities of every item across their categoy levels, algorithm CBA allocates each transaction to a proper cluster For example TID 50 has three items g x and y Item y is large in cluster C1 and item y is large in cluster C2 Thus TID 50 has the same similarities in both Cl and CZ However, item z is a category F which is a large node in Cz Thus TID 50 is allocated to C To provide more insight into the quality of CBA we calculate the IG values of the clustering U1 shown in Figure 5 Note that for an item ik Ilea,lp are the two classified labels of item ir for represent ing purchased and non-purchased values For item g the information gain Gain\(g,Ul  I\(g,D  E\(g,U1  logz  1oy21  z\(-$log2  Sim ilarly IG values of other items are Gain\(h,Ul  0.15 Gain\(k,U  0.48 Gain\(rn,Ul  0.31 Gain\(n UI  0.48 Gain\(z UI  0 Gain\(y Ul  0.98 and GaZn\(z,U  0.39 Hence IGirem\(U1  C Gain\(J,,U1  2.89 where I is the set of items 9 h IC rn n z y 2 Similarly Gain\(B,Ul  hgz  A\(-dlogzr I  a g~oyz5 hZ 12  0.10 J.CI 0.33 Gain\(R,Ul  0.2 Gain\(A,Ul  0.41 Gain\(F,U  0.65 Gain\(E,U1  0.48 and IGcat\(Ul  Gain\(J UI  2.07 where C is the set of categories A B E F RI Then IGfot.l\(U1  J.CC IGitem\(Ui IG,t\(Ui  4.96 4 Experimental Results To assess the efficiency of CBA we conducted experi ments to compare CBA with a traditional hierarchical clus tering algorithm called CL standing for Complete Link I41 and another algorithm proposed in ZO for the con venience, the algorithm is named as Basic in this paper By extending both previous approaches with taxonomy con sideration in market-basket data we also implement algo rithm CLT standing for Completed Link with Taronomy and algorithm BasicT standing for Basic with Taxonomy for comparison purposes The details of data generation are described in Section 4.1 The experimental results are shown in Section 4.2 4.1 Data Generation We take tyrz reat macket-hket data from a rv book sfore company for performance study In this real data set there are ID1  lOOK transactions and N  21807 items Note that in this real data, there are volume of transactions containing only single items and many items are purchased infrequently In addition, the number of the taxonomy lwel in this real data set is 3 In addition to provide more in sight into this study we use a well-known market-basket synthetic data generated by the IBM Quest Synthetic Data Generation Code 51 as the synthetic data for performance evaluation. This code will generate volumes oftransaction data over a large range of data characteristics. These trans actions mimic the transactions in the real world retailing environment This generation code also assumes that peo ple will tend to buy sets of items together, and each such set is potentially a maximal large itemset The average size of the transactions is denoted by ITl The average size ofthe maximal potentially large itemsets is denoted by 111 The number of maximal potential large itemsets is denoted by jL1 The number of items in database is denoted by NI The number of roots is denoted by NR and the number of the taxonomy level is denoted by NL 4.2 Performance Study We conduct two experiments in this section for perfor mance study and the clustering quality is evaluated by the IG values For algorithms CBA Basic and BasicT the minimum support percentage S is set to 0.5 Recall that 551

of the query expression without ha ving the global view of the in ten tion There is a big c hance that the enco ded pro cedure ma y not b e the b est w a y to compute the rules dep ending on the database instance F urthermore as w e understand it their prop osals require p oten tially large n um ber of name generation for relations and attributes The names that are needed are usually database dep enden t and th us p ossibly cannot b e gathered at query time An additional pro cess needs to b e completed to gather those v ariables b efore actual computations can b egin 5  9 Optimization Issues While it w as in tellectually c hallenging to dev elop a declarativ e expression for asso ciation rule mining from deductiv e databases there are sev eral op en issues with great promises for resolution In the w orst case the least xp oin tneedsto generate n 2 tuples in the rst pass alone when the database size is n  Theoretically  this can happ en only when eac h transaction in the database pro duces an in tersection no de and when they are not related b y subset-sup erset relationship In the second pass w e need to do n 4 computations and so on The question no w is can w e a v oid generating and p erhaps scanning some of these com binations as they will not lead to useful in tersections F or example the no de b 0 3 in gure 11 is redundan t A signican t dierence with apriori lik e systems is that our system generates all the item sets top do wn in the lattice without taking their candidacy as a large item set in to consideration Apriori on the other hand do es not generate an y no de if their subsets are not large item sets themselv es and thereb y prunes a large set of no des Optimization tec hniques that exploit this so called an ti-monotonicit y prop ert y of item set lattices similar to apriori could mak e all the dierence in our setup The k ey issue w ould b e ho ww e push the selection threshold minim um supp ort inside the top do wn computation of the no des in the lattice in our metho d F or the momen t and for the sak e of this discussion let us consider a higher supp ort threshold of 60 for the database T of gure 9 No w the l-en v elop e will b e the one sho wn in ligh ter dashed lines in gure 11 and the no des under this line will b e the large item sets Notice that no ww eha v eto discard no des ad 2 0 and d 0 2 to o This raises the question is it p ossible to utilize the supp ort and condence thresholds pro vided in the query and prune candidates for in tersection an y further Ideas similar to magic sets transformation 3  24 ma y be b orro w ed to address this issue The only problem is that pruning of an y no de dep ends on its supp ort coun t whic h ma y come at a later stage By then all no des ma y already ha v e b een computed and th us pushing selection conditions inside aggregate op erator ma y b ecome non-trivial Sp ecial data structures and indexes ma y also aid in dev eloping faster metho ds to compute ecien t interse ction joins that w e ha v e utilized in this pap er W e lea v e these questions as op en issues that should be tak en up in the future F ortunately though there has been a v ast b o dy of researc h in optimizing Datalog programs including recursiv e programs suc h as the one w e ha v e used in this pap er and hence the new questions and researc h 5 Recall that their prop osal requires one to express the mining problem to the system using sev eral queries and up date statemen ts that utilizes information ab out the database con ten ts to ac hiev e its functionalit y  c hallenges that this prop osal raises for declarativ e mining ma y exploit some of these adv ances Needless to emphasize a declarativ e metho d preferably a formal one is desirable b ecause once w e understand the functioning of the system w e will then be able to select appropriate pro cedures dep ending on the instances to compute the seman tics of the program whic hw e kno wis in tended once w e establish the equiv alence of declarativ e and pro cedural seman tics of the system F ortunately  w e ha v e n umerous pro cedural metho ds for computing asso ciation rules whic h complemen t eac h other in terms of sp eed and database instances In fact that is what declarativ e systems or declarativit y buy us  a c hoice for the most ecien t and accurate pro cessing p ossible 10 Conclusion Our primary goal for this pap er has b een to demonstrate that mining asso ciation rules from an y rst-order kno wledge base is p ossible in a declarativ ew a y  without help from an y sp ecial to ols or mac hinery  and that w e can no wha v ea v ery in tuitiv e and simple program to do so W eha v esho wn that it is indeed p ossible to mine declarativ ekno wledge b y exploiting the existing mac hinery supp orted b ycon temp orary inference engines in programming languages e.g Prolog or kno wledge base systems e.g RelationLog XSB LD L  CORAL All w e require is that the engine b e able to supp ort set v alued terms grouping aggregate functions and set relational op erators for comparison functionalities whic hmostofthesesystemscurren tly supp ort W e ha v e also demonstrated that our formalism is grounded on a more mathematical foundation with formal prop erties on whic h the seman tics of the R ULES system rely  W e ha v e also raised sev eral op en issues related to eciency and query optimization whic h should b e our next order of business As future researc h w e plan to dev elop optimization tec hniques for mining queries that require non-trivial lo ok ahead and pruning tec hniques in aggregate functions The dev elopmen ts presen ted here also ha v e other signican t implications F or example it is no w p ossible to compute c hi square rules 4 using the building blo c ks pro vided b y our system Declarativ e computation of c hi square rules to our kno wledge has nev er b een attempted for the man y pro cedural concepts the computation of c hi square metho d relies on In a separate w ork 2 w e sho w that the coun ting metho d prop osed in this pap er can be eectiv ely utilized to generate the exp ectations needed in order to compute suc h rules rather easily  These are some of the issues w e plan to address in the near future The motiv ation imp ortance and the need for in tegrating data mining tec hnology with relational databases has b een addressed in sev eral articles suc h as 12  13 They con vincingly argue that without suc h in tegration data mining tec hnology ma y not nd itself in a viable p osition in the y ears to come T o b e a successful and feasible to ol for the analysis of business data in relational databases suc htec hnology m ust b e made a v ailable as part of database engines and as part of its declarativ e query language Our prop osal for declarativ e mining bears merit since it sheds ligh t on ho w rst order databases can be mined in a declarativ e and pro cedure indep enden t w a y so that the optimization issues can b e delegated to the underlying database engine Once suc h argumen ts are accepted sev eral systems 9 


related issues b ecome prime candidates for immediate atten tion F or example traditionally database systems supp orted declarativ e querying without the necessit y to care ab out the pro ceduralit y of the queries In this pap er w eha v e actually demonstrated that asso ciation rule mining can b e view ed as a Datalog query  It is immediate that a direct mapping from the Datalog expressions presen ted in this pap er to SQL can be dev elop ed with no problem at all W e can then rely on ecien t database pro cessing of the query in an optimized fashion Hence w ecomeclose to the essence of the visions expressed b y the leading database researc hers and practioners 12  References 1 Rak esh Agra w al and Ramakrishnan Srik an t F ast algorithms for mining asso ciation rules in large databases In VLDB  pages 487{499 1994 2 Anon ymous A declarativ e metho d for mining c hisquare rules from deductiv e databases T ec hnical rep ort Departmen t of Computer Science Anon ymous Univ ersit y USA F ebruary 2001 3 C Beeri and R Ramakrishnan On the po w er of magic In Pr o c e e dings of the 6th A CM Symp osium on Principles of Datab ase Systems  pages 269{283 1987 4 Sergey Brin Ra jeev Mot w ani and Craig Silv erstein Bey ond mark et bask ets Generalizing asso ciation rules to correlations In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 265 276 1997 5 D Chimen ti et al The LD L system protot yp e IEEE Journal on Data and Know le dge Engine ering  2\(1 90 1990 6 Jia w ei Han Jian P ei and Yiw en Yin Mining frequen t patterns without candidate generation In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 1{12 2000 7 Marcel Holsheimer Martin L Kersten Heikki Mannila and Hann uT oiv onen A p ersp ectiv e on databases and data mining In Pr o c of the sixth A CM SIGKDD Intl Conf  pages 150{155 Mon treal Queb ec 1995 8 Flip Korn Alexandros Labrinidis Y annis Kotidis and Christos F aloutsos Ratio rules A new paradigm for fast quan tiable data mining In Pr o c of 24th VLDB  pages 582{593 1998 9 Brian Len t Arun N Sw ami and Jennifer Widom Clustering asso ciation rules In Pr o c of the 3th ICDE  pages 220{231 1997 10 Mengc hi Liu Relationlog At yp ed extension to datalog with sets and tuples In John Llo yd editor Pr oc e e dings of the 12th International L o gic Pr o gr amming Symp osium  pages 83{97 P ortland Oregon Decem ber 1995 MIT Press 11 Rosa Meo Giusepp e Psaila and Stefano Ceri An extension to SQL for mining asso ciation rules Data Mining and Know le dge Disc overy  2\(2 1998 12 Amir Netz Sura jit Chaudh uri Je Bernhardt and Usama M F a yy ad In tegration of data mining with database tec hnology  In Pr o c e e dings of 26th VLDB  pages 719{722 2000 13 Amir Netz Sura jit Chaudh uri Usama M F a yy ad and Je Bernhardt In tegrating data mining with SQL databases In IEEE ICDE  2001 14 Ra ymond T Ng Laks V S Lakshmanan Jia w ei Han and Alex P ang Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained asso ciation rules In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 13{24 1998 15 Jong So o P ark Ming-Sy an Chen and Philip S Y u An eectiv e hash based algorithm for mining asso ciation rules In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 175{186 1995 16 Karthic k Ra jamani Alan Co x Bala Iy er and A tul Chadha Ecien t mining for asso ciation rules with relational database systems In Pr o c e e dings of the International Datab ase Engine ering and Applic ations Symp osium  pages 148{155 1999 17 R Ramakrishnan D Sriv asta v a and S Sudarshan CORAL  Con trol Relations and Logic In Pr o c of 18th VLDB Confer enc e  pages 238{250 1992 18 Konstan tinos F Sagonas T errance Swift and Da vid Scott W arren XSB as an ecien t deductiv e database engine In Pr o c of the A CM SIGMOD Intl Conf  pages 442{453 1994 19 Sunita Sara w agi Shib y Thomas and Rak esh Agra w al In tegrating mining with relational database systems Alternativ es and implications In Pr o c A CM SIGMOD  pages 343{354 1998 20 Ashok a Sa v asere Edw ard Omiecinski and Shamk an tB Nav athe An ecien t algorithm for mining asso ciation rules in large databases In Pr o c of 21th VLDB  pages 432{444 1995 21 Pradeep Sheno y  Ja y an t R Haritsa S Sudarshan Gaura v Bhalotia Ma y ank Ba w a and Dev a vrat Shah T urb o-c harging v ertical mining of large databases In A CM SIGMOD  pages 22{33 2000 22 Abraham Silb ersc hatz Henry F Korth and S Sudarshan Datab ase System Conc epts  McGra w-Hill third edition 1996 23 Shib y Thomas and Sunita Sara w agi Mining generalized asso ciation rules and sequen tial patterns using SQL queries In KDD  pages 344{348 1998 24 J D Ullman Principles of Datab ase and Know le dgeb ase Systems Part I II  Computer Science Press 1988 25 Mohammed J Zaki Generating non-redundan t association rules In Pr o c of the 6th A CM SIGKDD Intl Conf  Boston MA August 2000 1 0
