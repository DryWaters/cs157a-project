Abstract 
Data streaming frameworks constructed to work on large numbers of processing nodes in order to analyze big data are fault-prone Not only the large amount of nodes and network components that could fail are a source of errors 
Development of data analyzing jobs has the disadvantage that errors or wrong assumptions about the input data may only be detected in productive processing This usually leads to a reexecution of the entire job and re-computing all input data This can be a tremendous profuseness of computing time if most of the jobês tasks are not affected by these changes and therefore process and produce the same exact data again This paper describes an approach to use materialized intermediate data from previous job executions to reduce the number of tasks that have to be re-executed in case of an updated job Saving intermediate data to disk is a common technique to achieve fault tolerance in data streaming systems These intermediate results 
can be used for memoization to avoid needless re-execution of tasks We show that memoization can decrease the runtime of an updated job distinctly 
I I NTRODUCTION The Big Data notion dominates currently reporting on novel systems and developments as it gives a hope that the analysis and the exploration of huge data sets gathered by companies and public organizations will allow to recognize patterns and thus will enable data-driven decisions in the future The driving forces for this development are the availability of sensors collecting data in nearly all areas of the everyday life on the one hand and the scalability of modern cloud infrastructures able to process the data within tight time 
limits However a number of supporting components  from distributed le systems such as GFS via massive-parallel data analysis engines such as Hyracks[2 or Nephele[3 to programming languages such as JA or PIG 5  must be developed to create a balanced system capable of processing the Big Data Our Stratosphere system is together with Hadoop one of the rst stacks in this area as it combines an execution engine Nephele for massively-parallel cloud infrastructures PACT programming model for parallel description and e x ecution of generalized map  reduce operators including primitives that allow the easy speciìcation automatic optimization and efìcient execution of joins as well as a declarative and query 
language Extensive experimental evaluations with different use-case scenario placed Stratosphere among the most prominent data analytics stack that enables the extraction analysis and integration of heterogeneous data sets ranging from strictly structured relational data to unstructured text data and semi-structured data Stratosphere is an open-source project available at 
under the Apache license While the scalability of Stratosphere was proven using realworld use cases the fault tolerance remains the weak point when operating in environments with 1000 nodes Node failures occur often and affect the processing and the correctness of the results In worst case failures of single machines

can require to start the processing all over if the application is not designed in a fault tolerant way So application of check-points and other well-known fault tolerant mechanism is mandatory for the deployment of Stratosphere On the other hand these measures are connected to signiìcant CPU and network load affecting the scalability of the execution leading to loss of valuable compute time Therefore we aim to nd the balance between creating check-points and the necessary memorization so we are able to provide the desired faulttolerance with acceptable cost In order to design and implement this solution we dive deeply into the Stratosphere execution engine Nephele which was developed in the group The parallel data pro 
cessing framework Nephele is based on Job description as directed acyclic graphs DAGs where every vertex of the DAG describes a task of the overall job The tasks are executed as a black-box user code so one need to learn from the outside which execution steps are best suitable for a check-point The result of this learning process are so called ephemeral materialization points that sa v e intermediate data for recovery Depending on the further progress of the execution the ephemeral points are saved on the solid memory and used to restart the processing in case of failure Once an outage is monitored all tasks following these materialization points and the failed task instance are restarted The materialization 
points are used as input for the restarted tasks while all other tasks will ignore any already processed input This approach prevents a job from a full restart in case of a non-durable failure like network aws However a durable failure like a programming mistake in the user code still causes the job to fail completely The user would have to adjust the code and submit a new job although the changes may only affect one particular task in the overall job A further improvement of the scalability properties and thus speed-up of the processing can be reached if the system is

able to recognize identical checkpoints and re-use the already saved data instead of creating a new copy This leads to a signiìcant reduction of a management overhead caused by introduction of fault tolerance actions Therefore we present in this paper a technique called in order to reuse materialization points of previous jobs with equal components This approach is not only valuable in case of a failure but may also be useful for optimization Memoization is well known from programming language design It is used to cache return v alues of function e v aluation to speed up calculation The cached values are usually ordered by the frequency they are used during calculation To make use of the memoization it is necessary that the functions are free from side effects e.g every evaluation with the same input parameters produces the same output Analogue to the programming language model a task processing an input value can be considered as a function evaluation Therefore the Materialization points can be regarded as saved function evaluations values for the task However it would also be possible to use classic memoization in Stratosphere Since the tasks are black-box code and the data is a non-interpreted sequence of bytes for the Nephele layer this could only be done in upper layers and is therefore not part of this work The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II describes the underlying model and the assumptions for the memoization approach Section III comprises a brief introduction to creation and characteristics of the materialization points mentioned above The possibility of job comparison is discussed in Section IV Section V introduces the reuse of materialization points for memoization In Section VI the described approach is evaluated and Section VII gives an overview of related work before the paper is concluded in Section VIII II M ODEL AND A SSUMPTIONS The model and assumptions of this work are based on the parallel processing framework Nephele Nevertheless the model is very similar to the model of other frameworks  The data processing jobs are described as directed ac yclic graphs DAG with the vertices being tasks of the overall job and edges describing the data ow between these tasks This DAG is call in Nephele During runtime the is compiled into a so called  The has multiple parallel vertices for each vertex of the  representing the parallel instances of the task The edges of the are subdivided into between task instances In particular each Channel is a link between an output channel at the data producing tasks instance and a input channel at the data consuming tasks instance Each job each vertex and each channel in the can be identiìed by an unique ID One ore more parallel instances are deployed to servers where each instance processes a part of the input data of the task This input data is either read from a distributed le system or received from parallel instances of the predecessor task Fig 1 Graphs in Nephele The data processing engine executes black box user code given to the system as compiled Java classes The user code is assumed to be side effect free every run of a parallel instance with the same data input will produce exactly the same output The output of a task instance is an uninterpreted sequence of bytes to the processing engine Each parallel instance can possibly materialize its output to disk into so called materialization points In contrast to e x ecution engines lik e Hadoop the Nephele Framework does not by default materialize data between two tasks Instead the framework offers three different types of data distribution between tasks The user or upper layer can choose between FILE NETWORK and IN-MEMORY channels FILE channels are similar to the MapReduce data propagation all data is written to a le on disk Not until all data is written to disk the consuming task can read its input Using NETWORK channels no data is written to disk All produced output is immediately send to the consuming task over network and can be processed on arrival NETWORK channels allow data to be pipelined between tasks IN-MEMORY channels are a special case of NETWORK channels were the producing and the consuming task are running on the same machine Instead of sending the data over the network it is pipelined using the shared memory The listing 1 shows a simple Nephele construction Nephele offers generally three types of vertices for a job InputVertex OutputVertex and TaskVertex In the given example the Input is read from a File and the is used When creating a vertex the user has to specify the class that contains the code to be executed Depending on the type of vertex the class has to implement corresponding interfaces In this case the reading of the input data is done by the  Additionally the path to the input File has to be set for the input vertex this applies to the output likewise

The example job has one input one working task and one output To run a task in parallel instances the number of subtasks can be set For the the number of subtasks is set to three in the example code To create the  the data ow has to be described Therefore the vertices have to be connected using the method In the example the reading task is connected to the working task this indicates a data ow from the reader to the worker At this point the connection type must be set as well in this example the tasks are interconnected using network channels III M ATERIALIZATION P OINTS Ass mentioned above in Nephele data is not written to disk unless the FILE channel is used for data transfer between tasks In order to achieve fault tolerance it is necessary to write some intermediate data to disk nevertheless Therefore we introduced ephemeral materialization points as a transparent fault tolerance technique Materialization points are the written output data from a task instance of the overall job The decision whether a materialization point is written or not is made dynamically after monitoring the taskês behavior during the processing of the rst part of the input In detail the tasks process their input and hold the output in main memory until there is no more space available During this time the ration of input and output data and the cpu-usage of the task is monitored Based on these values a decision is made whether to write the data and upcoming output to disk before sending it to the consumer task There are four different states for a materialization point UNDECIDED NONE PARTIAL and COMPLETE In the states UNDECIDED and NONE there is no le written either because the decision was not yet made or the decision was reached not to write a materialization point If a task materializes its output data the materialization can either be COMPLETE i.e all output data was produced and written to the materialization les or PARTIAL i.e data is still written to the les After the decision making progress no data is held in memory any more If a materialization point is written all data is written to disk before it is send over the network as depict in gure 2 Materialization points are written dynamically during runtime Therefore the user usually does not have knowledge of the positions of written materialization points Furthermore materialization points are created during the runtime and discarded after the job has successfully nished or nally failed In order to make use of materialization points from previous jobs it is necessary to keep the les of COMPLETE materialization points after a job run As described above in Stratosphere each job can be identiìed by a statistically unique ID In the same manner each Task Vertex in the job graph can be identiìed by a Asa materialization point belongs distinctly to a producing vertex the corresponding les are named using the  Fig 2 Materialization In detail materialization points are sets of serialized  are a wrapper for the actual data containing the source of the data identiìed by an unique for an output channel The actual reuse of the materialization points is analougus to the recovery in case of a task failure When replaying a materialization point the corresponding broker for this receives the  determines the corresponding output channel and sends them to the connected input channel IV E QUALITY OF J OBS In order to make use of materialization points of previous job runs it is crucial to compare jobs As a job is a tuple of tasks connections and input data Jobs are equal if all tasks all connections and the input data are equal Since a Task is user deìned content the equality of two tasks is given by the equality of the user code Connections are simply equal if the they connect the same tasks in the same direction Finally the Input data must be equal too As the Nephele system does not have any information about the character of the input data this might lead to a binary diff This is not a problem in this case because it is not important where or how the data might have changed just whether it changed The reuse of materialization points for a job is possible if only tasks of the job have changed and changes of connections are limited to successors of the changed tasks However it is only possible to use materialization points written by predecessors of the rst changed tasks in the processing order As the changed Task will most probably produce different data any following tasks receives different input data and will therefore produce different output Previously written data from the changed task itself or its followers is not reusable On the other hand any changes of the job succeeding the changed task dose not inîuence the memoization The main issue is to identify equality of tasks As a task is deìned by a user deìned function UDF this means the equality of the user code It is possible to execute a simple diff off the two java class les but this method leads to two problems First this does not cover dependencies of classes As the task is associated with a UDF i.e a invokable class changes of a class the UDF depends on would not mark

s which store the source of the data using the  Materialization points themselves are les for each vertex named after the  To do so the IDs of the vertices and connections are saved and reused for the non updated vertices when an updated job is submitted As mentioned above the updated tasks and their successors are marked as updated From the updated tasks a breadthìrst search against the processing order for a completed materialization point is done If COMPLETE materialization points exist all predecessors of the corresponding vertices are switched to the state FINISHED Figure 3 and gure 4 show a given updated Job example and the reconstructed Job after comparison The task that has written the materialization point will be marked as FINISHED after it replayed the materialization point For any submitted task of a newly submitted job the framework searches for materialization points in case the task is re-submitted during recovery Therefore the materialization points for a updated job are found automatically VI E VALUATION In order to evaluate the memoization of materialization points it is interesting to compare the runtime of a job using memoization vs the runtime for a complete restart of the job As the submission of a job using memoization includes reading and applying the job information of a previous run the setuptime is an important value to monitor It is expectable that the runtime decreases with the use of memoization The decrease is expected to be smaller the earlier the changes are in the  However the approach itself has an overhead caused by the rewriting of the an the reading of the materialization points The runtime measurement can show whether and when the memoization is proìtable An Optical Character Recognition job served as test job for the evaluation It is analog to the archiving job Derek Gottfrid wrote for the New York Times archiving 4  Articles from 1851Ö1922 given in a TIFF format should be generated to searchable PDFs Therefore he wrote a Hadoop job which reads the 11 million articles data from storage and generates the PDFs The job was deployed to Amazons EC2 Cluster We decided to use this job because of the real world issue it solves The archiving of data that is not available in digital is a common task these days Additionally to the PDF generation the test job creates an inverted index for the recognized texts Figure 5 shows the of the OCR task Reading the les from the underlying distributed lesystem the data is handed to the OCR task After recognition the texts are send to the PDFCreator and the task creating the inverted index Then the PDFFiles and the index are written to the lesystem The OCR task is parallelized to 24 instances and the PDF generator is parallelized to 6 instances 4 http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/01 self-service-prorated-super-computing-fun Fig 5 OCR Job Fig 6 Setuptimes The job shows the advantage of memoization very well because it has the characteristic to begin with the most time and resources consuming task the OCR All following tasks are comparable lightweight especially the index creating task Therefore it would be expected that changes of the PDFCreator or the index creating task would be considerably faster to recompute using the memoization approach For the jobês input we used pictures of the sides of a PDF Version of the King James Bible 5  For the test runs we marked one task as updated but left the code unchanged to make the runtimes comparable We used the OCR the PDFCreator and the Index task for the update We measured both the runtime and the setuptime The runtime is measured after the job has scheduled until all tasks are nished The setuptime is the time between the submission of the and the scheduling of the job including the reconstruction of the graph The setuptimes are an average from all runs with updated tasks and the same number of runs without updates As shown in gure 6 the setuptime using the updated mode is slightly longer than in regular mode The mean extension for the setup amounts to 47 milliseconds This increase is of no 5 http://www.davince.com/content/blogcategory/14/33

Fig 7 Runtimes for OCR with updated tasks and regular restart consequence compared to the gain of runtime Figure 7 shows the average runtimes for the test runs with the updated tasks and the regular restarts runtime The measurements are from 10 runs for each updated task and 30 regular restarts As one can see depending on the updated task the gain of runtime can be huge Memoization for the updated task leads to a runtime of only 15 of the restarted task Updates in the PDFCreator task reduce the runtime to 81 and updates in the OCR task still lead to 95 of the restart runtime This is because the main time consuming work is done by the OCR and the PDFCreator task The Index task is fast as long as all data is available Updates in the OCR task lead almost to a complete restart and thus do not beneìt much of the memoization approach We also tested a triangle enumeration job written in PACT As mentioned in the introduction Nephele is part of the Stratsophere system In Stratosphere Jobs are written in PACT not directly as Nephele Jobs PACT is extending the known MapReduce programming model it provides the additional second-order functions Match CoGroup and Cross In contrast to MapReduce the data model of PACT uses schema-free tuples The PACT triangle enumeration job is similar to other triangle enumeration jobs which are used in social networks It is based on the two step approach of rst nding all pairs of edges with one identical node and secondly nding edges for the other two nodes in the pair The is shown in gure 8 Brieîy described for each tuple of edges  the job will process a tuple as a possible e xisting edge to close a triangle In the last match step these edge-candidates are matched with the existing edges of the graph to nd the existing triangles It is explained in detail in W e process this algorithm on sample data from the 2009 Billion-TripleChallenge 6 converted to integers 6 http://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/btc-2009 Fig 8 Triangle Enumeration Job Fig 9 Runtimes for triangle enumeration with updated tasks and regular restart We have chosen this job to observe the runtime behavior in a worst case scenario The triangle enumeration job is a worst case job because the main time consuming work is done by the last tasks in the pipeline Updates in the job will therefore only skip the less time consuming tasks in the pipeline In this case it may be possible that the overhead is higher then the decrease of runtime As expected the test runs for the triangle enumeration job did not show the signiìcant runtime decreases as for the OCR job However the updated runtimes where in average still between 85 and 97 of the restart runtime as shown in gure 9 Nevertheless the gains of memoization can be huge and as the runtime decrease overweight the setuptime increase it is a useful technique especially in a jobês development phase

VII R ELATED W ORK As brieîy mentioned memoization or functional caching is a well known technique to avoid re-execution of functions or incremental computation by caching results 13 In contrast to the classic memoization the introduced technique does not cache single results of a tasks function evaluation but a complete output of a task Elghandour and Aboulnaga introduced ReStore a system to reuse intermediate data of single MapReduce Jobs within a workîow of MapReduce jobs The implementation is an extension to It re writes the MapReduce jobs compiled by Pig and stores intermediate data for reuse in similar jobs  Unlik e the Pig e xtension the approach described in this paper is independent from the higher layer language Popa et al describe DryadInc a incremental computation for append only data sets It has two functionalities either the user has to give a merge function for previously and newly computed data or the fully automated reuse of previous results for a new computation The automatic so called is a form of memoization and similar to the approach described in this paper In contrast it is only based on additional data input in order to avoid re-execution of the previous executed data Nectar is an approach to manage automatic caching for computations to improve data center management and resource utilization including the reuse of sub-computations This is done by rewriting programs to be able to use cached data for sub-expressions As distinguished from this idea the described memoization does not consider resource management but runtime optimization VIII C ONCLUSION This paper describes an approach to use intermediate materialized data to avoid a complete job re-run in case of an updated task The concept of materialization points in Nephele was brieîy described We discuss the comparability of jobs and the problems that arise with automatic comparison We deìne our solution to this issue using user input We introduce memoization of materialization points to reuse intermediate data from previous job runs to omit the execution of tasks that remained constant between two runs The memoization was done by rewriting the job in order to replay materialization points of unchanged task in the overall job In Section VI we showed that memoization can decrease the job-runtime signiìcantly However we also showed that the beneìt of the technique is highly dependent on the job characteristic and the position of the task that has changed within the job But the overhead for the job setup using memoization showed to be comparably small and the runtime itself does not increase using this method Thus memoization turns out to be a helpful tool especially in development phase were failures in the code are still expected to occur The developer is able to use the memoization technique to program an ne-tune his code Overall the introduced memoization approach has still room for improvement which are our future work The discussed issue about the comparison of jobs is an important part for optimization in order to make memoization as transparent to the user as possible As mentioned in IV the main issue of dependency analysis is a complex eld A solution might be to use a third party tool for this Another improvement would be the optimization of the re-execution in terms of optimization of parallel execution If all data is read immediately from disk and the next consuming task does not have to wait for it to be produced it could be beneìcial to increase the degree of parallelism for the consuming task This is not yet possible in the described approach R EFERENCES  A Behm V  R Borkar  M J Care y  R Gro v er  C Li N Onose R Vernica A Deutsch Y Papakonstantinou and V J Tsotras Asterix towards a scalable semistructured data platform for evolving-world models

  15 somewhat different to implement the required spectral ranges of the 4 channels A common broad community question is how the SNR of a measurement at airship altitude can be related directly to that of geostationary deployment. The answer, as people versed in the field know, is that for viewing a uniform extended source, up close or far away, the SNR does not change if the source fills the field of view of the pixel, i.e the footprint. The footprint area and therefore the number of photons emitted from the footprint, N EF increases as the square of the distance to the source, D 2 but the fraction of N EF incident on the aperture decreases as D 2 so the signal and therefore the SNR, remains invariant to D.  In contrast if a source, e.g., a star, fills only a part of the footprint, then the SNR does decrease as a function of the distance to the star. In the case of an imaging spectrometer, if the telescope images the uniform extended source on to the slit with a beam of the specified focal ratio, i.e., f/number, then the SNR is constant no matter the distance to that source A hopefully simple example follows. Consider the TIMS 2010 campaign with airship a ltitude 0.362 km On viewing from this altitude the per pixel footprint along the slit is 5.43 cm. Multiplying by the ratio of geostationary to airship altitudes \(36217/0.362\rows the pixel footprint to 5.43 km and importantly maintains a full field of view of the extended earth surface light source, exactly the same as in the case of deployment on the airship. To \221zoom in\222 and reduce the size of the footprint to the desired 2.7 km along the north - south \(NS\t direction requires doubling the effective focal length from aperture to slit and the aperture diameter must also be doubled to maintain the f/3 focal ratio from telescope aperture to the slit. As discussed above whether physically moving or optically zooming, the SNR for a footprint on an extended source is unchanged geoCARB focal plane assemblies \(FPAs 226 These are to be Teledyne 1024 x 1024 format H1RGs. The unit pixels are identical to those of the NIRCAM shortwave camera which uses a Teledyne H2RG with 2048 x 2048 format. The electronics to operate the NIRCAM H2RG aboard the James Webb Space Telescope mission have been developed here at the LM ATC. For the geoCARB application the  H1RG FPAs require cooling to 125 K in order to render negligible dark  current contribution to zero level instability and noise. To achieve this an enclosure that includes from the input slits through to the FPAs will be kept at 125 K That would also ensure there are no spectrometer thermal photons to contribute to zero level instability and noise. The camera electronics would be adaptations of those developed for the NIRCAM short wave camera The TIMS Teledyne HAWAII-1 FPA and the H1RG are very similar. The H1RG is the current generation of the HAWAII series and the TIMS FPA is first generation Comparison is given in table 6. The newer generation has improved pixel to pixel uniformity Table 6.

To achieve high SNR in low light conditions a 4.08s exposure \(or stare time is used. For the same purpose the slit is two pixels wide \(5.4 km wide EW on the earth\he slit  is scanned 2.7 km  per step in the EW direction in a step and stare operation \(4.08s stare time + 0.34s move time\his provides spatial over-sampling by a factor of  two. The resulting E/W scan rate is 2400 km per observing hour and facilitates mapping of  the gases CO 2 CH 4 and CO with 2.7 km sample spacing on continental size regions several times per day The optical design code, using actual tolerances as have been achieved in previous LM ATC space instrument builds predicts spatial resolutions per sample of 4.1 km NS and 5.4 km EW Per 4.08s stare time twelve consecutive spectral images or frames, with 340 ms integration times are acquired and coadded per pixel to a 1024  x 1024 buffer array. The coadded buffer comprises the spectral image that is reported to telemetry.  Correlated double sampling \(CDS\used per each of the 12 frames. In order to suppress inter-pixel capacitance noise to the requirement of 0.1%/pixel the CDS sampling is achieved by processing each successive row  with two consecutive  resets between reads \(read-reset then reset-read\plementation requires use of all 16 H1RG outputs clocked at 386 kHz.  The short 340 ms sample time avoids saturation for the brightest expected signals, while co-adding extends the dynamic range for geoCARB Band Table 7.

Considering the geostationary viewing operational advantage for selecting optimal cos\(SZA\, the mission median SNR in the 4 channels should be at least as large as listed in Table 8, that is SNR >> 200 in all 4 channels These are large enough to enable retrieval of CO 2 CH 4 and CO column mixing ratio per footprint with mission median precisions significantly < 0.7, 1.0 and 10.0 %, respectively 12  Estimating T SYS for the 1.61 \265m case The basis for the pessimistic estimate of T SYS 0.283 for the 1.61 \265m channel is shown in Table 9. The end of life factor is the product of NVR = 0.995, particulates = 0.983 scatter= 0.984 and contingency =0.990. The T SYS for the other channels was similarly estimated The 1.61 \265m grating efficiency 63%  in Table 9 is considerably larger than the TIMS\222 as seen in Table 5. The former was custom made with blaze optimized for the application such that the target order contains the majority of the diffracted light, and all other orders are quite dim. In contrast, the TIMS grating is an off the shelf part, not optimized for application in the TIMS target spectral region The vendor has indicated that for the TIMS application the available target order competes with another approximately equally bright order for the major share of the light in the target spectral range.   Therefore the TIMS grating efficiency \(Table 5 above\ considerably less than the optimized geoCARB grating efficiency Conclusion for Section 6 In this section we have described the multichannel geostationary application geoCARB that exploits the TIMS design approach; the operations and measurements; and some of the performance characteristics including application of the TIMS noise model to predict SNR performance. The performance satisfies the mission requirements for mapping several times daily on continental scales with spatial sampling and resolution of several km and with very high SNR per spectral sample per footprint 7.

  18 noise model in Section 4; the validation of the noise model against the best available data set, acquired in the 2008 joint campaign with the University  of Denver, in Section 5; and in section 6 a 4-channel space application of TIMS called geoCARB to acquire data in the O 2 A-band, the weak and strong CO 2 bands near 1.61 and 2.06 \265m, and a channel near 2.32  265m for CH 4 and CO, with capability from geostationary to map continental scales several times per day on contiguous samples with spacing the order 3 km at the sub satellite point. The geoCARB instrument and operational parameters input to the validated TIMS noise model, and the expectation for mission median values of cos\(SZA\ lead the conservative expectation for SNR 200 in the 4 geoCARB channels. This provides ample margin for retrieval of column mixing ratios of CO 2 CH 4  and CO with mission median precisions 0.7, 1.0 and 10 per footprint, respectively. This measurement set is capable of providing break through reduction of uncertainty and attribution for the sources of CO 2 CH 4 and CO within the large geostationary field of regard of the geoCARB References 1  J.
