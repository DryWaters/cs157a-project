   1  TECRA: C2 Application of Adaptive Automation Theory  Ewart J. de Visser 1,2 Melanie LeGoullon 1 Don Horvath 1  Gershon Weltman 1  Amos Freedy 1 Paula Durlach 3 and Raja Parasuraman 2         Abstract 227 This paper describes the design and initial positive eva luation of a prototype adaptive automation system to create  an enhanced command and control \(C2 infrastructure for more  effective operation of unmanned vehicles  1  2 At the core of our approach is a tri modal  adaptive interface display  which 
involves a daptive information presentation in order to balance workload and to promote effective human system performance This novel design came about as a direct result of field observations during a full scale military exercise and a cognitive task analysis \(CTA  based on these observations.  Using the CTA  we designed the basic Commander\222s adaptive interface format and automated triggering methods A priori GOMS analysis predicted a 50% decrease in time on task, based on a subset of representative tasks D ata c ollection  to date  supports these predictions.  Furthermore, feedback from subject matter experts and comparisons between user performance on TECRA versus an existing SUAV  platform suggest s that TECRA is easier to use, quicker to learn, and provides more ca pabilities to the user 
than current systems   Our main project objective is  to apply recent advances in cognitive engineering and displa y automation to create Technology for Enhanced Command and Control of Small Robotic Assets \(TECRA The initial goal is an enhanced C2  system for small unmanned aircraft vehicles \(SUAVs Our approach is  to  use adaptive display technology to improve shar ed situation awareness between the SUAV Commander and the SUAV Operator, to provide new channels of Commander Operator communication, and to reduce Commander workload  These results demonstrate how the TECRA  application  226 d riven by a cognitive analysis of the Commander\222s task, by a mission model of the anticipated Commander\222s needs, and by mission templates and real

as tactical decoys to conceal maneuvers by manned assets Mandates to reduce manning in the military have led to initiatives to assign multiple heterogeneous unmanned vehicles to a small number of human team members. T he goal of such robot human teams is to extend manned and unmanned capabilities and act as \223force multipliers\224, as in the US Army Future Combat System 1,2 3   Robot human teams introduce a new and unique aspect to the planning coordination and evaluation  of unit performance  Among the most successful fielded unmanned systems are the Small Robotic Assets SRAs  both Small Unmanned Air Vehicles SUAVs  and Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles  SUGVs   Recent successes in Iraq have provided an indication of their  potential for revolutionizing the way U.S 
tro ops conduct operations. SUAV scout planes and sensor systems have made it easier to spot insurgents and roadside bombs, thus saving lives  As a result, the U.S. Army is committing increased resources to deve loping enhanced surveillance, communications and weapons for SUAVs  Off the shelf SUAVs  such as the fixed wing Raven are currently deployed in sizable numbers  By March 2006, for example, the Raven had been deployed on more than 15,000 sorties  or deploy ments  totaling 18,673 flight hours. With regard to new platform technology, Army spokesman LTC John Kelleher has said, \223We are going to compare what is out there 226 the commercial, off the shelf fixed wing assets, such as Raven 226 with the ducted fan techno logy that the Army is developing, and we will make a 
decision on which way we are going to go.\224  T here are many essential human factors that need to be 1 Perceptronics Solutions, Inc  1001 19th St. N Suite 1500  Arlington, VA 22209  910-200-8596 edevisser@percsolutions.com   2 George Mason University  4400 University Drive MSN 3F5  Fairfax, VA 22030  910-200-8596 edevisse@gmu.edu   3 U.S. A rmy Research Institute   12350 Research Parkway  Orlando, Fl, 32826  407-384-3983 p aula  d urlach us.army.mil  
 


   2  optimized for the SUAV operators themselves, and there is much research being done to address these issue s Neumann and Durlach   provide a brief review of factors affecting a user\222s ability to teleoperate a robot or vehicle  and many other publications cover this ground also The presently proposed paper however, focuses on the equally important but rel atively neglected problem of coordination of SUAV operator and unit commander team performance. It is important to assure that commander operator team performance is optimized with respect to such key factors as efficient communication, teamwork, well dist ributed workload and effective operation of the SUAV system in order to realize the full poten tial contribution of the SUAV This is particularly true as manning considerations make it more likely that one unit commander will control a number of small robo tic assets, thus further complicating the team interactions.  Accordingly, there is a pressing need for analysis of and technological solutions to the problems currently preventing effective command and control of small robotic assets  The most critical p roblem areas in the command and control of SUAV assets include  1  Inadequate information f low  from the SUAV to the small unit Commander The Commander has insufficient information on current and planned SUAV operations, and inadequate contextual knowledge wi th which to interpret and guide the progress of the overall mission  2  Poor c oordination  between Commander and SUAV operator\(s There is typically little or  no common view of the SUAV\222 activities and capabilities, a limited voice communications channel, and  consequently a high frequency of miscommunication regarding the long term and immediate mission objectives and tasks  3  Limited commander t raining  in terminology and technical details of the vehicle operation  This lack of knowledge exacerbates communicatio n problem and contributes to system ineffectiveness and/or failure  4  Inadequate systematic m ethods  for training and feedback This includes no standard after action review AAR  methodology for commander operator coordination, no standardized team performan ce measures and no evaluation metrics to inform systematic training  This paper describes the design and initial investigation of a prototype command and control system aimed at creating an enhanced C2 infrastructure that allows more effective operation of  unmanned vehicles. To demonstrate and test this prototype, we decided to use small unmanned aircraft vehicles \(SUAV\ as our initial target platform because of their immediate importance to current military operations and because analysis has shown that t he current absence of an adequate command infrastructure is a key detriment to their fully effective utilization. In addition, we selected the Raven SUAV as our specific use case and evaluation testbed  We describe the Raven SUAV platform, followed by a detailed description of our design and prototype system  We follow this with a summary of the  interviews that we conducted with subject matter experts \(SME who reviewed our system  We conclude with a description of an experiment aimed at validating our de sign prototype and testing the efficacy of the interface  2  T HE R AVEN SUAV  S YSTEM  The Raven is a compact, lightweight SUAV that can be prepared and hand launched in minutes for the purpose of conducting aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissan ce \(ISR\ missions during infantry combat operations, including urban warfare operations/MOUT. The basic Raven package consists of the battery powered air vehicle \(AV\ and a set of video camera payloads, a ground control unit \(GCU\ and a remote video termin al \(RVT which is essentially a GCU without uplink capability 5  Figure 1 shows the normative Raven C2 configuration for the most recent RQ  11B+ Version. The components are as follows  Vehicle Operation 227 The SUAV is normally operated by a 2 person team  of Vehicle Operator  VO\ and Mission Operator \(MO\ who are located close together. The SUAV is flown directly by  the VO using the GCU which displays the direct video view from the SUAV as  well as flight information such as coordinates. Mission planning in terms of waypoints, modes  etc., as well as mission monitoring adjustment and review is done by the MO on a dedicated PC  using the specialized Talon Tool for the general FalconView map display program  Data Transmission 227 Flight control data from the VO a nd MO stati ons are transmitted by radio to the SUAV. These data include the mission waypoints, mission modes, etc., as well as direct flight  commands, and are stored on board the SUAV. The SUAV re transmits the stored mission data  along with real time upda tes as flight status data and also transmits real time video information  The data transmitted from the SUAV are displayed in various formats on the GCU, the Talon Tool  enabled FalconView PC and the R VT  Command 227 The Commander under whom the Raven is being flown is typically located remotely from the VO/MO operating team. He monitors the mission on his RVT, which displays the real time  video signal and a superimposed set of flight status information. He may also use a PC with  
 


   3  FalconView maps for improved  sit uation awareness, but the FalconView application will not include  Raven real time flight status information  Communication 227 The Commander communicates with the MO and/or VO using voice over a radio net. He may communicate directly or through an intermediary generally the fire control  officer. The VO and MO normally communicate with each other directly as they are usually close  enough together, but also share the radio communication net  3  A DAPTIVE A UTOMATION D ESIGN M ETHODOLOGY  Our challenge was to design an adaptive interface for commanders that facilitated information flow between the SUAV  and the human s and enhanced commander vehicle operator coordination A further challenge was to design our new interface so that it could work together with the current  Raven SUAV system  In the current Raven system the commander primarily has a RVT that serves as the main source of visual imagery from the SUAV.  The RVT display is identical to that of the VO  and consists of several flight parameters superimposed over  a video scene \(see Figure 2   Our approach was  to 1\ enhance the current commander\222s display by adaptively displaying relevant i nformation as the mission progressed, and 2\ extend the current capabilities of the system by turning the display into a portal through which the commander could access advanced features and communicate intent to the Raven operators  We used our own adapti ve design methodology that consisted of five steps  Step 1: Field Observations  E xtensive field observations w ere conducted at two locations   Ft. Benning, GA  and Ft. Polk, LA  i n order to understand the commanders\222 tasks and their informa tion needs    A t Ft. Benning the observations focused on Army doctrine training, and schoolhouse knowledge of small UAVs by observing a day of training at the Small Unmanned Aircraft System \(SUAS\ Course During this day current Raven operators were being trained to become Raven instructors for their units  At Ft. Polk we observed company commanders and their infantry units over several days of a week long full scale exercise intended to prepare Army units for upcoming deployments  The observational  data collected fr om both locations resulted in a wealth of information including 50 hours of field observations 2 hours of audio transcriptions and over 3 hours of videotape footage from interviews with Raven operators a copy of the c urrent Raven manual and c lassroom pr esentation materials from the SUAS course              Figure  1  Normative Raven Command and Control setup     
 


   4    Step 2: Cognitive Task Analysis  Using the knowledge gained from the schoolhouse doctrine and manuals, we developed a comprehensive Hierarchical Task Analysis HTA  that highlighted the typical tasks a commande r perform s during a Raven mission as well as the specific information requirements  associated with those tasks This task analysis was then used to prepare probes for the  field observations made during the training exercise. The results from this second tr ip served to inform a modified  version of Klein, Calderwood, and MacGregor\222s 7  Critical Decision Method Cognitive Task Analysis CTA  The HTA and the CTA revealed an interesting pattern T he commander\222s tasks could be sorted into three general task cate gories monitoring the current video feed, reviewing past information, and re tasking the vehicle in flight.  We refer to t hese categories collectively as mission phases   In addition to this emergent categorization of tasks, the CTA  helped identify  severa l bottlenecks that might plague a typical mission The most common \(and arguably the most disruptive\ bottleneck was the  radio communications between commander and Raven operators  as shown by the operational sequence diagram \(see Figure 3  Factors cont ributing to this bottleneck were radio frequency congestion intermediaries, and the absence of the message recipient  A second bottleneck stemmed from the commander\222s incomplete  understanding of the Raven system which sometimes leads to additional radio  communications  A final bottleneck was the slow manner in which information  obtained by the Raven was distributed from the command post to the rest of the company  Step 3: Preliminary Adaptive Interface Design: Overview  Our newly proposed design  was  a departure from the current system in which the commander must make do with raw flight data and spend precious time waiting for queries, re tasking directives and responses to be relayed over the radio net to the vehicle operators Using the bottlenecks listed above as critical areas of  improvement, we identified three main system requireme nts to guide our design   First, th e new interface must reduce reliance on verbal radio communications   Second, t he interface must be intuitive      nd and Control setup         Figure 3 226 Operation Sequence Diagram showing communicati ons bottleneck for commander     Figure 2  Commander\222s RVT display      
 


   5  And third, t he interface must facilitate the production of products for later consumption such as during pat rols and A fter Action Reviews \(A ARs  In short  we envision ed  an interactive display that bypasses the brittle and cumbersome nature of voice radio communications by creating a data link between the interfaces of the commander and the operators   Mission Modes W e propose d three analogous Missi on Mode displays b ased on the three distinct mission phases identified by  the CTA  These give the commander the flexibility he needs to manage the UAV asset effectively based on his information needs and time availab le.  The modes are briefly described below  and displayed in Figure 4  Monitor Mission Mode  Display 227 Th e Monitor  view is the default view and will allow the commander to watch the Raven video feed in real time. The video display is largest in the configurati on to allow easy situation awareness assessment by the commander. The current location of the asset is readily available in a thumbnail map while details of what is being tracked appear in the mission analysis panel  Review Mission Mode  Display 227 The R eview  M ission view  allows the commander to examine  stored imagery of targets and  landmarks that have been obtained by the Raven. In this mode the commander can flip through captured images  and video clips  obtain distances for roads and landmarks, read target specific information entered by the MO, and mark up the images with several annotation tools in the Mission Analysis panel  Change Mission Mode  Display 227 The change mission mode allows the commander to quickly signal a course change to the Raven team when n eeded. The map is largest in this configuration to allow accurate flight plan review and in flight re tasking requests    Figure 4 The three modes: Monitor, Review, and Change Mission Mode  Step 4: Selecting Invocation Methods  The proposed interface will  switch modes adaptively  based on \(1 mission type  2  critical events, and \(3 individua l preferences of the commander.  The critical question is Which invocation points should trigger the adaptive mode selection  and when should they be activated  Our a pproach to this issue  was to use the  goals and methods from the HTA  to build a GOMS model  for the commander  The methods in this model describe the specific goals a commander can accomplish with the interface. The decisions represent the choices the comman der has to make when accomplishing these goals. The selection rules describe which procedural IF THEN rule the commander can follow when multiple options are available. The model provides a useful framework to support the various invocation methods  Missio n Type 227 Different missions require different goals to be accomplished. For instance, reconnaissance missions typically have a specific aim in mind such as \223verify target X is at location Y\224 while surveillance involves a more general goal of observing whatev er can be seen Depending on the mission at hand, mission specific goals can be included or excluded from the model  Critical Events 227 During a mission, certain events may require an interface adaptation. For example, upon spotting a suspicious car, an operator engages the loiter  mode and the left  camera for the Raven Following such a sequence, the commander\222s display could switch to the Monitor Mode  Selection Rule for Goal: MONITOR MODE  IF Flight mode = Loiter and Camera = Left and Monitor Mode = off  THEN Accomplish Goal: SWITCH TO MONITOR MODE  IF Flight mode = Loiter and Camera = Left and Monitor Mode = on  THEN Accomplish Goal: MAINTAIN MONITOR MODE Commander Preference 227 The system can also learn the preferences of commanders by monitoring and ana lyzing their goals and decisions and incorporating such information into a Bayesian network. For example, one commander may frequently take a picture of the same object of interest. The system may offer to take the picture for commanders if they have a hig h probability of deciding to do so  Step 5: Implement and Validate Method of Invocation  One of the well documented benefits of GOMS is the ability to make  a priori  predictions about performance times of expert behavior.  Thus, we tested the feasibility of  our design in the very early stages of development by comparing the predicted performance times of our proposed interface against the predicted performance times of the current system for three representative tasks.  The results showed a 48% improvement i n performance time, shaving almost 5 
 


   6  minutes off a nearly 10 minute series of tasks.  Based on these very promising results, we c ould  justify continued development of th e new design  4  T HE TECRA  P ROTOTYPE  The TECRA prototype was designed to create a new c ommand and control infrastructure that will support the Commander and improve Commander Operator team performance Another goal was to enhance Commander Operator coordination. Based on analyses described in the previous section, we developed an integrated Commander\222s display that combines video, navigational, and mission information. The TECRA system\222s Commander display makes use of existing, as well as new mission information data links to facilitate shared situation awareness among the Commander and the S UAV Operators throughout the mission  This section describes in detail the TECRA functionality and interface design  TECRA Raven Configuration  The  projected  new TECRA Raven configuration is shown in Figure 5  The most important elements are described be low  A dditional flight  data sent to TECRA Commander interface 227 The flight status data can be  provided to the Commander\222s PC via an already available connection from the RVT unit This data incorporates mission planning and route data  entered by the MO, repr esenting almost all of the information available on the MO\222s PC, as well  as real time SUAV data  This new information will be supplied to the Commander via the new TECRA Commander Interface  New MO CMDR data link will enhance communication and shared aware ness 227 In addition, a new radio based data link  is established  between the Commander\222s and the MO\222s PC  which will enable \(1\ direct texting between the two team members, to improve mission related  communication, and 2\ transmission to the Commander\222s PC of  MO inputs not included in the  SUAV downlink signals to improve shared awareness by coordinating the two displays  TECRA Commander 222s  Interface  A completely new interface was designed and developed for the mission Commander \(see Figure 6 This interface c onsists of the  tri modal adaptive component display. The three mission modes correspond to specific mission tasks that Commanders typically engage in. The specific TECRA interface components are described below  Area Map 227 The area map \(upper left\ is synchronized with the vehicle operator\222s FalconView, giving a common picture of the authorized airspace, planned route, and areas of interest.  Commanders can draw directly on the map for their own use, print off copies for dissemination, or send the              Figure 5 226 Projected TECRA Rav en C2 Configuration     
 


   7  markup to the operators for a clear explanation of their intent.  Commanders can also create suggested waypoints or routes and submit them to the vehicle operat ors for review  Video Feed 227 The video feed \(upper right\ comes directly from the UAV and presents selected flight data Commanders can freeze the frame, rewind, fast forward take screenshot pictures, and even record video clips, while the mission is under way. The field of view is depicted on the map, not just showing the commander \223Where am I?\224 but also \223What am I looking at?\224  Mission Timeline 227 The mission timeline \(lower left\ is able to track multiple vehicles and record events such as waypoints, when pho tos and video clips were taken, and user created bookmarks for later review  Saved Media Library 227 The saved media library \(middle left  gives easy access to screen captures and video clips, which are sorted and listed in a library of locally stored pictures  and videos.  Each item is tied to a geographical location which appears on the map when the image is reviewed  Messa ge Center 227 The message center \(lower right\ lets Commanders communicate with their operators through a built in chat feature that enables users to send/receive queries and updates, as well as coordinates and mark up symbols  Toolbar 227 The toolbar  far right permits editing of both maps and images, with built in drawing tools.  In addition to these tools, the Commander can also save and export new images to external applications  5  SME  E VALUATION  The first step in evaluating our new TECRA interface was to hav e military commanders use it and evaluate its efficacy  We recruited officers at Ft. Campbell to participate in this study. Results of this study are  described in this section  Method We had a sample size of six  including three Captains, one  Lieutenant, a nd two enlisted service members from 1st and 3rd BCTs   O ur sessions ran about 2 hours.  We began with an interview to gauge the background of the participant, and then introduced the TECRA  system Participants learned the  Figure 6 226 TECRA Commander Interface    
 


   8  basics of the system via one on one training, and then were asked to perform the similar tasks on their own  All audio was recorded, as were keystrokes and screenshots When time was tight, this training session was reduced to a demonstration, and feedback was elicited from the partici pant during the demo. Following the TECRA session we administered another questionnaire that focused on the interface  Results  The responses to TECRA were overwhelmingly positive The commanders we spoke with confirmed that our system adds functionality they currently do not possess, as did the Raven operators.  In addition, commanders rated the system as user friendly and easy to learn. Some of their actual comments included  1  223It\222s a pretty simple system. I would use this.\224  2  223I think this is useful in a l aptop version or being able to interface on a website based thing\205 on a computer in a company CPU would be very useful.\224 3  223Yeah, I mean it all seems pretty user friendly especially if you sat down and played with it a few times. It\222s pretty quick to figure out.\224 4  223I think this is a good little system.\224  6  E XPERIMENTAL S TUDY  Our next goal was to evaluate the TECRA system more formally. In particular, we were interested in comparing the current remote viewing terminal   RVT system to our new TECRA system and d etermining if we would find any performance benefits. We decided to simply compare the currently used RVT interface with the newly designed TECRA interface  Several measures were used in this experiment to compare the two interfaces. Besides performance o n task s we were particularly interested in two important human performance issues including maintaining  or improving  situation awareness and balanced mental workload O ne major system design goal is to facilitate high levels of situation  awareness for all  team members involved. This is a major concern for UV operators, but it is also important for Commanders or other individuals consuming sensor data from the UV. By increasing the situational awareness of UV customers, the overall mission should become mor e efficient  When shared situational awareness is not employed inefficient human robot teaming may result. Situation awareness issues such as unreliable voice communication  between a commander and vehicle operator or a lack of a common view of the asset\222s  activities between the commander and the operator may cause unnecessarily high cognitive demands, in an already highly cognitive demanding and stressful environment  TECRA is designed to make it easy for users to find information on the screen and in part icular  to help inform users where they are geographically and what they are looking at. Theoretically, this design should improve situation awareness when they are using the system. In addition, subjectively experienced workload should be reduced because the display was designed to be sparse only showing those elements that are useful to the operator  therefore hypothetically reducing the effort needed to locate critical information   We therefore predicted that users of the TECRA software would have an ea sier time locating information and thus show an increase in situation awareness for the TECRA system compared to the current RVT display. We also predicted a decrease in subjectively experienced workload In addition, we expected that users would perform better on target detection tasks compared to  the RVT  Method Twelve students from George Mason University \(4 Males and 8 Females\ participated in this study and were compensated with course credit.  After signing an informed consent form, the experimenter read the experimental instructions to the participant. Participants were also shown picture examples of the targets that they were instructed to identify. Participants did not receive any training on either of the two SUAV monitoring interfaces This was d one so we could examine how easy it was to learn to use either of these systems  Target Detection Task 227 Participants were asked to monitor a video feed from an SUAV using the new prototype TECRA interface and the currently used RVT  interface. The task was t o identify target buildings. The majority of the scenery displayed on the video feed was two dimensional graphics. Targets consisted of 3 dimentional buildings, which  would appear intermittently throughout each scenario Participants were instructed to res pond to each target by pressing a button and briefly describing the size and color of the building  Situation Awareness Task 227 In addition to the target detection task, participants were also instructed to simultaneously answer questions sent to them via ins tant 223chat\224 messages. Messages were sent once every 35  45 seconds. Participants were asked to respond to each message by typing and send ing  their answer via the chat window Two types of questions were asked: secondary distracter questions \(simple arithmetic problems\; and Situation Awareness \(SA\ questions. The SA questions concerned the 
 


9  current state of the SUAV. These questions included 1  What waypoint is the vehicle heading toward 2 What is the ground speed of the vehicle 3  What is the altitude of the v ehicle  4  What direction is the vehicle traveling cardinal direction or heading These specific questions were chosen as measures of SA for two reasons: 1\ each of these four characteristics \(upcoming waypoint vehicle speed vehicle altitude and vehicle direction\ were identified as important pieces of information for the Commander, especially when making a route request and 2 both the TECRA interface and the RVT interface display this information, therefore making it possible for the participant to answer all SA questions using either of these interfaces  In both conditions \(TECRA interface and RVT  interface\ all of the information needed to answer the SA questions was included on the video feed overlay However the two interfaces displayed and organized the information differently Participants completed four trials two trials using the current RVT system and two trials using the TECRA prototype Each trial lasted approximately 10 minutes and consisted of 12-14 targets and 8-11 situational awareness questions The conditions were counterbalanced to account for ordering effects Participants also completed the NASATLX workload index after each trial Results All data was analyzed using a 2x2 Repeated Measures ANOVA with condition Interface Type RVT  TECRA\ and Scenario 1,2 Results described include data for target detection accuracy and reaction time situation awareness and subjective workload Target Detection 227No significant differences were found for target detection accuracy  F 1,11  0.238 p   0.05 and reaction time  F 1,11\ = 1.29 p 0.05    Figure 7 \226 Target Detection Accuracy However, there was a trend in favor of the TECRA system Accuracy was slightly higher in the TECRA interface condition  M   69 SEM   4 compared to the RVT  co ndition  M   68 SEM   4 see Figure 7 Reaction time was also slightly faster on average by 1 second in the TECRA condition see Figure 8 Low power due to the small sample was probably the reason why this result was not  significant  Figure 8 \226 Ta rget Detection Reaction Time \(seconds Situation Awareness 227There was a significant effect for Interface Type for situation awareness accuracy  F 1,11  44.57 p  0.05 and situation awareness reaction time  F 1,11\ = 15.58 p 0.05.

Furthermore, trends showed that the TECRA system may improve target detection performance compared to the RVT system although these results are not reliable The re sults empirically demonstrate the efficacy of the TECRA interface Improvements in situation awareness are vital  as they can matter in time critical situations where the timely and accurate information can save lives In addition reducing subjective workload was one of the major objectives of this program and cited as a critical requirement for the commander The results are also consistent with the original GOMS model that predicted a reduction in time needed to operate the TECRA system compared to the original RVT  system Furthermore this experiment only consisted of a basic monitoring task  The systems were not used for making route requests taking pictures or video clips from the live video feed or relaying and receiving critical information from t he MO It is likely that the observed performance improvements when using TECRA for conducting a simple monitoring task would extent to benefiting a Commander when conducting additional, more complex C2 tasks. Further research will need to be conducted to measure the benefits of other TECRA functionality 7  C ONCLUSIONS  Our goal for this project was to design a system that would improve coordination and performance of SUAS crews. We did this in a systematic manner. First we analyzed the current situation by interviewing users of the Raven system and observing military exercises We then developed our own design methodology to design an adaptive automation interface system  based on previous theory    W e  t o o k a  prototype of the interface and showed it to SME s who provided us with feedback Finally we conducted an experiment to examine whether our system would improve overall performance The SME interviews showed that the TECRA system was easy to use easy to learn and added functionality that did not yet exist The experiment showed that situation awareness improved and subjective workload was reduced when using the TECRA system in comparison to the RVT system Taken together these are encouraging results in favor of the TECRA system  Several future research directions are being planned First we intend to further test the adaptive features of the interface in a follow up experiment with a larger sample size  We plan to compare several conditions including a situation where there is no automation non adaptive \(static\ automation, or

This forms the foundation of tactical level modeling in the three-layer survivability analysis developed in Ma \(2008  3.2. Competing Risks Analysis  Competing risks analysis \(Box 3.2; Ma &amp; Krings 2008b for detailed discussion in the context of PHM and reliability subject of survival analysis. It has a history dating back to 1760 when Daniel Bernoulli studied the risks around the smallpox inoculation. However, modern competing risks analysis draw extensively on survival analysis, which was only initiated in late 1950s but the active research was not conducted until the1970s The application of competing risks analysis in reliability is quite earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 


earlier, the most famous model may be the Marshall-Olkin model 1967 controversies around the issues of identifiability, which shadows its value when multiple latent risks are dependent.  Three excellent monographs exist for competing risks analysis \(David &amp Moeschberger 1978, Crowder 2001, Pintilie 2006 perspective of survivability analysis, competing risks analysis can be used for analyzing the effects of unpredictable risks by treating the unpredictable events as censored or the effects of latent risks We use the term latent risks to refer to potential failure risks \(but only one of the risks ultimately causes the system failure survivability analysis; this usage of latent risks is totally consistent with the concept of latent risks in competing risks analysis, where these risks are modeled precisely  3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis                                                      Cont' Box 3.1  Another model that is of nearly comparable status with Cox model is the Accelerated Failure Time model

Basics of the Competing Risks Analysis \(CRA  In competing risks analysis \(CRA experiences multiple risks simultaneously, but it may fail from one of the risks only and fail only once. The risk that leads to the failure becomes the cause of the failure Therefore, risk is often used before the failure occurs and the cause is preserved for the afterwards \(Crowder 2001 failure is the defining characteristic of competing risks analysis. It also implies that the system is multivariate from the perspective of risks, but univariate from the perspective of the single failure time and single cause  There are two sets of formulations for CRA in the literature. The first is described with a pair of vectors of random variables the latent \(theoretical David and Moeschberger 1978 used below well as sub-survival functions \(Crowder 2001  There is one and only one cause in the set of k causes for each failure observed.  The elements of C are called risks before failures and causes afterwards. The risks compete for the cause. In reliability analysis, C might be faulty components in a series system and T is the breakdown time of the system; or C might be the failure modes, such as asymmetric vs. symmetric  The sub-distribution function is defined as   tTjCtjF equivalently, the sub-survivor function is defined as   tTjCtjS &gt Obviously jptjFtjS   where   jSjFjCp j represents the marginal distribution of C

Similarly Pr\(cause j | time t specific age group 9 The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multi-state modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multi-state models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and PHM. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one reference in the form of monograph, i.e., by Hougaard 2000 analysis in the context of reliability and PHM can be found in Ma &amp; Krings \(2008c 2008d frailty and multi-state modeling, respectively. Given the complexity involved with multivariate survival analysis, any description of actual model is quite involved and hard to fit in a comment box. Box 3.3 only contains a few concepts  The previous univariate survival analysis and, to a lesser extent, the competing risks analysis have several significant limitations. The first limitation is the implicit assumption of single failure or single time-to-event transition. In Figure 2 multiple states and multiple transitions are the norm, rather than the exception. This is a multivariate survival system and multi-state modeling is obviously more appropriate than the univariate or competing risks analysis. Competing risks analysis can only address the multiple risks, but not multiple failures, which further can be dependent with each other. In more general terms, multiple failures with common-events modes represent the typical failure mechanisms in a multivariate system, but both univariate survival analysis and competing risks analysis can help little in modeling the dependences This constitutes the second limitation.  A third limitation is that not all covariates are observable, and some of the unobservable or unobserved may have critical influences on the 'survival' \(or transitions between states nodes. These unobservable covariate factors may create common-risks dependences, and the shared frailty model can capture these kinds of unobservable common-risks While the capability to capture the effects of unobserved or unobservable common-risks is critical for reliability modeling, its criticality to survivability modeling cannot be overemphasized because the quantitative study of this issue does not exist in the existing survivability research Therefore, shared frailty modeling is a critical tool for studying the influences of UUUR events in the tactical level modeling of survivability  Of course, the above limitations discussed equally apply to the traditional reliability theory because traditional reliability theory is based on the binary-state logic \(either failed or operational especially of computer networks, is often characterized by 


especially of computer networks, is often characterized by the multi-state performance degradations before reaching the complete failure. This multi-state nature of reliability has been increasingly recognized in recent years, and the most significant advances have been in the field of multistate reliability modeling \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003                                                 4. STRATEGIC MODELING AND DYNAMIC   Box 3.3. Multivariate Survival Analysis  Dependence Mechanisms  Dependence is often the central focus of multivariate survival analysis, and together with censoring, they complicate survival analysis most significantly. Hougaard \(2000 three mechanisms of dependence: \(i ii iii Common events are equivalent to common mode failures in reliability analysis, for example, failure events due to accidents or natural disasters. The common risks mechanism describes the scenario that the individuals are dependent due to some common unobserved risks such as common genes in siblings or a bug in the operating system that may affect all software running on 


operating system that may affect all software running on it. The third mechanism, event-related mechanism refers to the phenomena that the actual event itself changes the risk, such as virus infection of a computer node Shared Frailty Modeling  Shared frailty theory occupies the central focus of multivariate survival analysis. The dominance is not accidental because frailty captures crucial but often directly unobservable \(latent random variables, which are attributable for dependence and variations. To some extent, dependence, variation randomness, and frailty all address some facets of multivariate failure events. The frailty theory provides a unique set of approaches to address the theoretical and practical issues related to those four concepts.  Similar to the fact that censoring is the trademark feature of survival analysis \(both univariate and multivariate frailty theory is the trademark of multivariate survival analysis. These two trademark properties, censoringhandling and frailty modeling, have made multivariate survival analysis a unique and indispensable mathematical tool for biomedical and public health research Multi-State Modeling  Multi-state has been developed concurrently in several fields in the last decade, including survival analysis \(Hougaard 2000 reliability \(Lisnianski and Levitin 2003 Commenges 1999 Huzurbazar 2006 multi-state modeling has been adopted to solve the domain specific problems, and the flow graph modeling offers a flexible and powerful approach to analyze multi-state models in general. Multi-State model is often formulated as Markov Process models. The transition probabilities in multi-states modeling are well defined by survivor functions \(Hougaard 2000 multi-state model is to estimate the state transition probabilities from hazards functions. multivariate system. According to Lisnianski and Levitin's \(2003 any systems that can have a finite number of performance rates are multi-state systems. Furthermore a system may consists of components which themselves could be multi-state subsystems 10 4. STRATEGIC LEVEL MODELING AND DYNAMIC HYBRID FAULT MODELS  Hybrid fault models are derived from agreement algorithms Lynch 1997 redundancy management in fault tolerance.  Therefore, the choice of hybrid fault models directly affects reliability analysis and fault tolerance. Despite the close ties between reliability and fault tolerance fields, Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e Ma 2008a with regard to the quantitative relationship between reliability analysis and hybrid fault models. To address the unrealistic assumption, they proposed a new concept  dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF mathematical tools \(survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling we first briefly describe the issues involved and summarize some of their key findings in Box 4.1  Agreement algorithms started out with the introduction of the Byzantine general problem by Pease et al. \(1980 Lamport \(1982 system are abstracted as generals of an army.  Loyal generals \(non-faulty components algorithm e.g., to attack or retreat while traitors \(or bad components others by sending conflicting messages. Because the focus of agreement algorithms is to reach agreement in the presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the 


presence of faults and not on issues related to fail rates, the failure rate is often ignored or is implicitly assumed to be constant. In other words, the agreement algorithm, together with the assumptions about faults and their cardinality determines if agreement can be reached.  However, there is no direct link to the notion of real time in agreement algorithms or the associated hybrid fault models. This implies that agreement algorithms only specify whether or not an agreement can be reached, given a certain number of traitors, but they do not keep track of when the generals committed treason. Ignoring the notion of real time is appropriate in the study of agreement algorithms because they are only concerned with provable agreement even if the voting is dynamic \(multiple rounds of voting time is abstracted as rounds which are discrete and do not bear real-time values  The key issue is that the time \(in terms of rounds agreement algorithm or the hybrid fault models does not capture the process dynamics in terms of real time as needed in the analysis of reliability. When fault models are applied in analyzing a real-world system consisting of multiple components \(generals must be considered. Some generals may be loyal for their entire lifetimes; some may quickly become "corrupted;" still others may be loyal for long time but ultimately become  corrupted  Each of the generals may have different inhomogeneous not-constant function, ?i\(t generals  In most cases, the failure rate is completely ignored, and then the hybrid fault models are treated as static. For example, an engineer may claim that a system he designed will be able to tolerate 2 Byzantine faults, because the design has 7 redundant parts \(3m+1, m is the number of faults notion. In general, if we replace m with a time-dependent function m\(t t t-1 t t function of parts, then the statement becomes a timedependent predicate  In other cases, the consequences of different faults or failure modes can be hugely different. If a benign fault is replaced by a malicious fault, the consequence could be disastrous Without real-time notion, the dynamics of failure modes are never captured  From the above discussion, it is obvious that the lack of real-time notion in agreement algorithms and associated hybrid fault models is a critical issue of significant theoretic and practical implications, and the issue should not be ignored when agreement algorithms and hybrid fault models are applied to reliability analysis. To address this issue, Ma amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a fault \(DHF dynamic in two senses: the time-dependent failure rate and time-dependent failure modes  Actually, the issue is much more complex than what is briefly described above because the problem has two essential aspects.  The above brief introduction only reveals one aspect of the problem, i.e., the lack of real time notion This aspect is relatively straightforward to address and the proposed extension is to introduce time and covariate dependent failure hazard or survivor function \(see Box 3.1 The other aspect of the same problem arises when one tries to apply the new extension for reliability analysis. In other words, the extension with time and covariate dependent hazard function is necessary but not sufficient.  To integrate hybrid fault models or dynamic hybrid fault models reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously 


reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11                                                     


                                                Box 4.1. Agreement Algorithm Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Time and Covariate Dependent Hazard Function Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a the first aspect \(i.e., the lack of real time notion, or the agreement-algorithm side of the problem introduction of survival analysis. Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models. The following is a summary for the potential benefits of introducing DHF models to reliability and PHM  i

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
