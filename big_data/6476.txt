Instead of generating large number of rules the evolution optimization techniques like Genetic Network Programming \(GNP\n be used .The GNP is based on directed graph, In this paper the security issues related to deploy a data mining-based IDS in a real time environment is focused upon We generalize the problem of GNP with association rule mining and propose a fuzzy weighted association rule mining with GNP framework suitable for both continuous and discrete attributes Our proposal follows an Apriori algorithm based fuzzy WAR and GNP and avoids pre and post processing thus eliminating the extra steps during rules generation. This method can sufficient to evaluate misuse and anomaly detection. Experiments on KDD99Cup and DARPA98 data show the high detection rate and accuracy compared with other conventional method  Keywords  Intrusion detection, Probability density function Genetic Network programming, Genetic algorithm, Fuzzy WAR  I  I NTRODUCTION  Nowadays, many computing resources like on-line oriented applications have been developed and this type of computing fragile in network security measures. The expansion of Internet technology has thrown severe challenges in form of requirement of a suitable misuse and anomaly detection to safeguard the valuable information stored on system and for information in transit An Intrusion Detection System \(IDS\is expected to identify cruel behaviors that menace the integrity, confidentiality and availability of network resources. It can help to detect suspicious activities in the network .Likewise the major conventional detection techniq ues: misuse detection and anomaly detection Misuse detection system   are most widely used and they detect intruders with known patterns and signatures used to identify attacks that consist of various fields of network based packet information, like source address, destination address, and source and destin ation ports. This model needs continuous updating because of Adhoc network, but they have a virtue of having very low false positive rate. Anomaly detection systems identify deviations from normal user Behavior and alert to potential unknown or novel attacks without having any prior knowledge of them. They exhibit higher rate of false alarms and hence the need for a mechanism to reduce false approach arises. The traditionally detection methods are not suitable in fast growing network environment, and it also not considered for focusing massive knowledge of engineering and information security task experts are involved to analyzes the various mathematical methods for anomaly detection and also concentrate on various sequence code and patterns to detect the misuse detection, everything is computerized by machine learning code to detect the detection These methods are not suitable for current dynamic nature environment. Basic ideas for 3   4  are enab led in to s y st e m to record the activities like system events, legitimate activities and intrusion behavior. But this type of measures need advanced tools and techniques to detect suspicious activities. Both detection methods have been extensively studied by the research community for many years KDD99Cup and DARPA98 datasets  prov ided b y  MIT Lincoln Laboratory s are widely used as training and testing datasets for the evaluation of IDSs KDDCUPê99 intrusion detection dataset contains a standard dataset and training data to be audited .It an alyzes the connections of 41 features. All the connections can be divided into 5 categories including normal network connection, and other four categories are Denial of Service Attack \(DOS\ to Root Attack \(U2R\Remote to Local Attack \(R2L\robing Attack Data mining technology has emerged as a mean for identifying patterns and trends from large quantities of data Data mining is a step in Knowledge Discovery in database.

However this algorithm may suffer from large computational overheads for rule extraction from dense database GNP is a evolutionary optimization technique using unique graph structure instead of strings and tree, it evolves on Programming and algorithm, GNP composed of three kinds of nodes: initial node, judgment node and processing node Genetic Algorithm \(GA  8 9  h as been ap plied to th e  association rule mining. However, it is not easy for GA-based methods to extract enough number of interesting rules because a rule is represented as an individual population of GA. In our proposed method using the fuzzy weighted association rule mining combining with GNP.The main aim is to push the weight constraints into the pattern growth Apriori algorithm and provides a way to satisfy downward closure property. Attributes are given different weights within the weight range  Attributes in database correspond to judgment nodes in GNP. Weighted fuzzy Association rules are represented by the connections of nodes. Candidates of important rules are obtained by genetic algorithms. Then, the probability density function of th e average matching degree of the data with rules can be calculated. Based on this, new connection data can be easily classified into normal activity known or unknown intrusion The paper is organized as follows. The background information of GNP, Fuzzy with Genetic Algorithmic overviewed in Section II, and Fuzzy Weight Association Rule Mining, Fuzzy WAR combined with Apriori Algorithm Fuzzy WAR based Genetic Algorithm and Evaluation Function and operations is ex plained in detail in Section III Section IV describes the spec ific Probability Functions Simulation results with databases KDD99Cup are given in Section V. Finally, the conclusions and Future work are mentioned in Section VI II  O VERVIEW  A  Basic structure of GNP Genetic network programming is an evolutionary optimaz ation algorithm, which evolves directed graph structures as solutions instead of using strings in genetic algorithms or trees in genetic programming.GNP  11] ,[1 3  f r am e w ork is which includes one initial node, multiples judgment nodes and processing nodes  Initial node acts as booting node and it contains no processing inform ation like function or no conditional branch. The only role of the initial node is to determine the first node to be executed  Judgment nodes have some special function that is embedded and it takes judgment based as individual rules. Processing nodes work as action/processing functions. The selection of the current node is influenced by the node tr ansitions of the past selection Therefore, the graph structure itself has an implicit memory function of the past agent actions. The node transition begins from the start node, and then the next node which will be executed is determined by th e node transition and the number of nodes and their concrete fun ctions depend on the problem which are determined by the designers Fig.1 is The GNP in this figure has one start node, five judgments nodes and three processing nodes. The initial node i is only for determining which node should be the first node to be executed. The sets of J 1 J 2 J m  represents judgment nodes which have conditional branch decision functions, and return judgment results so as to determine the next node Processing nodes, like P 1 P 2 P n  serve as action functions to determine which action should be taken. The number of nodes and their concrete functions depend on the problems which are determined by the designers The genotype expression of GNP in a GNP individual NT i  denotes node type. 0 is initial node 1 is processing node, 2 is judgment node ID i Works as the identification number Ci 1  Ci 2  Mean the nodes connected from node i firstly, secondly and so on. And TD 1 TD 2 TDi K  denote the time delays of the transition from node i to node Ci 1 Ci 2 Ci K respectively     Fig.1.

First, the probability density function of the average matching degree of data with rules is used. Second, the probability that data is classified to anomaly intrusion. Third in order to improve the classification accuracy, weights are used to revise the probability  A  Probability Density Function The probability density function is generated as the following. First, the matching degree of each data d with every rule in the rule pool is calculated. The definition of the matching degree between the continuous attribute A i with linguistic term Q i and data a i of attribute A i is represented as  MD\(Q i a i M Q a\                             \(6  where, M Q  represents the membership function of linguistic term Q i Then, the matching degree between data and rule r including p continuous attributes and q discrete attributes\ is defined as  Match i d,r 8 9 6       2  7  where i is the suffix of continuous attributes in rule r  I denotes the set of suffixes of continuous attributes in rule r  p and q represent the number of continuous attributes and discrete attributes in rule r respectively, and t is the number of matched discrete attributes in rule r with data. Then, the average matching degree can be defined as  m k g   A B  8 CDE!F  G  H  A B 8  where R k  is the set of suffixes of the extracted rules in class k in the rule pool\(normal rules or misuse rules\ Finally, the marginal probability density function f i  x i  i 1,2,3É.k can be generated by calculating the distribution of the average matching degree of training data d I J 2HK  k ith r I R k  where J 2HK k is the set of suffix of training data in class k  K 2 is used in this paper   B  Building a Classifier The probability that new connection data d I  J 2/L2  belongs to class k is represented as follow  P k d M f N x N x N OOO OP  Q  M f N x N x N OOO  Q  P M f  x  x  OP   9  where J 2/L2  as the set of suffix of testing data.

improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
