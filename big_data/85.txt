MultiSOM: a multiview neural model for accurately analyzing and mining complex data Jean-Charles Lamirel, Shadi Al Shehabi LORIA, France lamirel@loria.fr, alshehab@loria.fr Abstract In the procedure of information analysis, like in the domain of patent analysis the complexity of the studied topics and the accuracy of the question to be answered may often lead th e analyst to partition his reasoning into viewpoints. Most of the cl assical information analysis tools can only manage an an alysis of the studied domain in a global way. The in formation analysis tool is considered in this paper is the MultiSOM tool, whose core model represents a si gnificant extension of the classical Kohonen SOM neura l model. The MultiSOM neural-based tool introduces the concepts of viewpoints and dynamics into the information analysis with its multi-maps displays a nd its inter-map communication process. The dynamic information exchange between maps can be exploited by an analyst in order to perform cooperative deduction between several different analyzes that have been performed on the same data. This paper demonstrates the efficiency of a viewpoint-oriented analysis as compared to a glob al analysis in the domain of patents. Both objective and subjective quality criteria are taken into account for quality evaluation Keywords multiple viewpoints, data analysis, unsupervised learning, SOM model, MultiSOM model, symbolic model knowledge extraction, association rules, patent analysis 1. Introduction The digital maps are not only tools of visualization but also represent important ana lytical tools. Appropriate display of cluster points can give the analyst an insight that it is impossible to get from reading tables of output or simple summary statistics. For some tasks, appropriate visualization is the only tool needed to solve a problem or confirm a hypothesis, even though we do not usually think of maps as a kind of analysis, as for patent analysis There is many ways to create digital maps. The one we consider here is based on Artificial Neural Networks ANNs\ANNs are a useful class of models consisting of layers of nodes. The power of ANNs is derived from their learning capability defined as a change in the weight matrix W  the strength of the links among nodes. Moreover, both their relationships with multivariate data analysis and their non-linear capabilities represent added-v alues for clustering and mapping. The Kohonen self-organizing map \(SOM model is a specific kind of ANN which implements in only one step the tasks of clustering and mapping a data set. The SOM learning is a competitive and unsupervised process and the approach gives central attention to spatial order in the clustering of data. The purpose is to compress information by forming reduced representations of the most relevant features, without loss of information about th eir interrelationships. The main advantages of the SOM model are its robustness and its very good illustrative power. Conversely, the fact that original model is only able to deal with one clustering of the data at a time might be considered as a serious bottleneck for exploiti ng it for accurate mining tasks The MultiSOM model, which is presented in this paper, introduces the co ncepts of viewpoints and dynamics into information analysis with its multi-map displays and its inter-map co mmunication mechanism The dynamic information exchange between maps can be exploited by an analyst in order to perform cooperative deduction between several different analyzes, combining clustering and mapping, that have been performed on the same data. This paper will mainly focuses on the study of the contribution of the viewpo int's oriented data analysis proposed by the MultiSOM model as compared to the global analysis proposed by the other models. An attempt will be made to define a pro tocol for performing such a comparison. The section 2 of the article presents the Kohonen self-organizing maps \(SOM\nd their main applications in mapping of science and technology. The section 3 deals with MultiSOM, the multi-map innovation of the SOM algorithm. The context of the experiment on the oil engineering patents and the preprocessing of these latter will be described in the section 4. The Section 5 describes the protocol of comparison which has been set up along with its results The section 6 presents an original attempt to extract implicit knowledge from the patents, like association rules, by the use of the MultiSOM inter-map communication mechanism in an automatic mode.

conclusions are finally exposed. An additional annex provides an example of us e of the MultiSOM model in an interactive mode by an information analyst 2. The self-organizing map \(SOM The basic principle of the SOM is that our knowledge organization at higher levels is created during learning by algorithms that promote self-organization in a spatial orde   of the SOM network is based on the understanding that the representation of data features might assume the form of a self-organizing feature map that is geometrically organized as a grid or lattice. The SOM algorithm takes thus a set of N-dimensional da ta as input and maps them onto nodes of a two-dimensional grid, resulting in an orderly feature ma  The SOM algorithm is pr esented in details in    consists of two basic procedures: \(1 selecting a winning node and \(2\updating codebook vector of the w inning node and its neighboring nodes Once learning is achieved, the data can be affected to the nodes of the map. After the map building, the main characteristics of the clusters resulting from the topographical clustering pr ocess have to be highlighted to the analyst in order to provide him an overview \(i.e. a global summary e analysis results. This task is difficult because the profiles of the obtained clusters are mostly complex weighted combination of indexes extracted from the data. A first set of solutions we have proposed for solving this problem, like cluster labeling and zoning strategies mechanisms, are presented in  Fig. 4 of section 4 presents a map resulting from the combination of all th e steps described above In the quantitative studi es of science, the Kohonen self-organizing maps have been successfully used for mapping scientific journal netw orks [1  a n d also aut hor co-citation dat ps have bee n als o s u ccess fully  used for several other applications in the general area of data analysis like for clustering meeting output, for clustering socio-economic dat  doc um entary database contents mapping and browsing [9   10 Ka ski  et al. have implemented a specific adaptation of SOM named WEBSOM, for the analysis of important docum WE BSOM m ain characte ristic is to include strategies for reducing the dimension of the entry data descriptions by using random projection techniques applied on word histograms extracted from the document contents. WEBSOM method has been tested for pate this method only manages such an analysis in a global way, it can only provide the analyst with general overview of the topics covered by the patents along with their interactions. A more exhaustive description of all the SOM applications might be found in 3. The MultiSOM model The communication between self-organizing maps has been firstly introduced in the context information retrieval for analyzing the relevance user\220s queries regarding the documentary database  represents a major amelioration of the basic Kohonen SOM model. From a practi cal point of view, the MultiSOM model introduces the use of viewpoints in the information analysis. The viewpo int building principle consists in separating the descrip tion space of the data into different subspaces corresponding to different criteria of analysis. The set of V all possible viewpoints issued from the description space D of a dataset can be defined as V = {v 1 v 2 203, v n v i 000\217 P\(D where each v i represents a viewpoint and P\(D represents the set of the parts of the description space of the data D  Three main remarks follow the above definition: \(1 the viewpoint sub sets issued from V may overlap one to another; \(2\he union of the different viewpoints can be viewed as the overall description space of the data; \(3 the most suitable basis an for homogeneous management of the viewpoints is a vectorial description space As an example, an image can be simultaneously described using 3 different vi ewpoints represented by 1\word vector; \(2\histogram vector; \(3 feature vector The principle of th e MultiSOM model is to be constituted by several SOM maps that have been generated from the same data. Each map is itself issued from a specific viewpoint. The relation between maps is established through the use of two main mechanisms: the inter-map communication mechanism and the generalization mechanism The inter-map communication mechanism enables to highlight semantic relationshi ps between different topics i.e. clusters\belonging to different viewpoints related to the same data. In MultiSOM, this communication is based on the use of the data that have been projected onto each map as intermediary nodes or activity transmitters between maps \(see Fig. 1 ct user activation or query matching activation 1  2 3 ct user activation or query matching activation 1 2 3 Source Map Target Map Figure 1 Inter-map communication principle The inter-map communication is established by standard Bayesian inference network propagation algorithm which is used to compute the posterior probabilities of target map's node T k which inherited of the activity \(evidence Q itted by its associated Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Coordinated Multiple Views in Explor atory Visualization \(CMV\22206 ISBN-10: 0-7695-2605-5/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE 


data nodes. This computation can be carried out efficiently because of the specific Bayesian inference network topology that can be associated to the MultiSOM model. Hence, it is possib le to compute the probability P  ac m t  T k  Q an activity of modality act m on the map node T k which is inherited from activities generated on the source map. This computation is achieved as follows  000\246 000\246 000\217 000\217 000 k km Td d Tactd d km SdSim SdSim QTactP     such that S d is the source node to which the data d has been associated Sim  d  S d ne correlation measure between the codebook vector of the data d and the one of its source node S d and d 000\217 act m T k if it has been activated with the modality act m from the source map The main objective of the generalization mechanism is to summarize the contents of a basic map into more generic topics \(see Fig. 2 Figure 2 Generalization principle Let n \327 m  n, m 000\225 2\the dimension of the map associated to a given level, the above described generalization process will then produce a next more general level in the form of a n 000\355 1 327  m 000\355 1\with 000\246 000\217 000\016 000 M n k k Vn M n M n W W 4 1 1 where V n M represents the square neighbourhood set on the map M associated to the neuron n of the new synthetic map M 1 Existing clustering algorithm, such as growing hierarchical self-organizing map \(GHSOM represents a dynamically growing architecture which evolves into a descending hierarchical structure of SOM Nevertheless, the weak point of this method is to isolate lower level maps without regard s to their potential links As opposed, our generalization method has the advantage of preserving the original neighbourhood structure on the new generated levels. Moreover, it ensures the conservation of topographic properties of the map neuron codebook vectors  It c oul d be also considered as an implicit and distributed form of a hierarchical classification method based on   straightforward relationshi p between the generalization and the inter-map communication mechanism. Therefore the inter-map communication could be used between map/gas and its generalizations in so far as they share the same projected data 4. Application In the two preceding sections we have introduced the MultiSOM model after hav ing previously presented the SOM model. In this section, we shall then use a real example, to make some of the notions more concrete. We argue that visualization into form of a set of maps represents an important adde d-value for analysis in the technology watching tasks as well as in science watch and in knowledge discovery in databases. Our example is a set of 1000 patents about oil engineering technology recorded during the year 1999 4.1 The analysis phase The role of the MultiSOM application has been firstly planed by the domai n expert in order to get answers to such various kinds of questions on the patents that Node of synthesis of level M +1 1 215Which are the relationships between the patentees?\216 2 215Which are the advantages of the different oils?\216 3 215Does a patentee works on a specific engineering technology, for which advantage and for which use?\216 Nodes of level M 4 215Which is the technology that is used by a given patentee without being used by another one?\216 5 215Which are the main advantages of a specific oil component and do this advantages have been mentioned in all the patents using this component?\216 An analysis carried out on all the possible types of question led the expert to def ine different viewpoints on the patents that could be associated to different closed semantic domains appearing in these questions. One of the main aim of the expert was to be able to use each viewpoints separately in order to get answers to domain closed questions \(like questions 1,2\maintaining the possibility of a multi-v iewpoint communication in order to get answers to multi-domain questions \(like questions 3,4,5\ that might also contain negation \(like question 4\fic vi ewpoints which have been highlighted by the expert from the set of possible questions are 1 Patentees 2 Title \(often contains information on the specific components used in the patent 3 Use 4 Advantages A fifth \215global viewpoint\216 which represent the combination of all the specific ones is also considered in order to perform our comparison between a global clustering mechanism, of the WEBSOM type, and a pure Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Coordinated Multiple Views in Explor atory Visualization \(CMV\22206 ISBN-10: 0-7695-2605-5/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE 


viewpoint-oriented clust ering mechanism, of the MultiSOM type 4.2 The technical realization The role of this phase con sists in mapping the four specific viewpoints highlighted by the domain expert in the preceding phase in four different maps. A preliminary task consists in obt aining the index set \(i.e the vocabulary set\ to each viewpoint from the full text of the patents. This task has been itself divided into three elementary steps. At the step 1, the structure of the patent abstracts is parsed in order to extract the subfields corresponding to the Use and to the Advantages viewpoints 1 At the step 2, the rough index set of each subfield is const ructed by the use of a basic computer-based indexing tool 3  T h is t ool e x tracts  terms and noun phrases from the subfield content according to a normalized terminology and its syntactical variations. It eliminates as well usual language templates At the step 3, the normalization of the rough index set associated to each viewpoint is performed by the domain expert in order to obtain the final index sets. Fig. 3 presents a patent abstract including its generated multiindex The following task consists in building the maps representing the di fferent viewpoin ts, using the algorithm described in section 2. Before these step, a classical IDF-Normalization step [19] is applied to the index vectors associated to the patents in order to reduce the influence of the most widespread terms of the indexes For each specific viewpoint a map of 10x10 nodes clusters generated. Two global maps representing global unsupervi sed patents clustering, of the WEBSOM  r e also c onst ructe d The index  sets of these maps represent the union of the index sets of all the specific viewpoints. They only differ one to another by the number of th eir nodes. The first one  GlobMin d to have the same number of nodes as the viewpoint ma ps \(i.e. 100 nodes second one GlobMax onstrained to have to sum of the number of nodes of all the viewpoint maps \(i.e. it becomes a 20x20 map co mprising 400 nodes Table 1 summarizes the results of the patent indexation and the map build ing. A single viewpoint map resulting from the whole ma p building process is presented at Fig. 4 4.3 Inter-map communication for analysis In comparison with the stan dard mapping methods, as such as principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling or WEBSOM global SOM analysis, the advantage of the multi-map displays is the inter-map communication mechanism that MultiSOM environment provides to user. Each map is representing a viewpoint  1 The Patentees and Title subfields are directly represented in the original patent structure and theref ore do not necessitate any extraction Each viewpoint is representing a subject category. The inter-map communication mechanism assisted the user to cross information between the different viewpoints. In both cases, the responses of the system are given both through activity profiles on the maps and through patents examples associated to the most active nodes \(i.e. topics representatives of these maps The estimation of the quality of thematic deduction is achieved through an evaluation of the activity focalization on the target maps  them a tic deduction betwee n the four different viewpoints of the study 5. Evaluation The advantages of the MultiSOM method seem obvious to the expert of the domain: the or iginal multiple viewpoints clustering approach of MultiSOM tends to reduce the noise which is in evitably generated in an overall clustering approac h while increasing the flexibility and the granularity of the analyses. Moreover with a global clustering method, like WEBSOM important relationships bet ween some subtopics are hidden in the cluster prof iles and therefore very difficult to precisely characterize. The expert found more than 35 of such important relationships by the use of the MultiSOM method. A simple example is given by the comparison of Fig. 4 and Fi g. 6. Other examples of more elaborated topic relationships that can be only obtained by the MultiSOM inter-map communication mechanism are given in the annex of the paper. Finally, the expert argued that the possibility of in teractively activating positively or negatively, the no des \(i.e. the topics\on the maps represents a great help for tuning very precisely an analysis process. Nevertheless, expert empirical evaluation remains insufficient to ob jectively compare global approach to viewpoint oriented approach. For this last purpose, we propose new ring quality estimators for both evaluating and optimising the results of the clustering and of the mapping methods, especially when they are applied in the domain of documentary databases. These estimators are more precisely described in the next section 5.1 Evaluation procedure When anyone aims at comparing clustering methods he will be faced with the problem of choice of reliable clustering quality measures The classical evaluation measures for the qu ality of a clustering are based on the intra-cluster inertia and the inter-cluster inert    h anks t o these t w o m easure s, a cluste ring res ult is considered as good if it possesses low intra-cluster inertia as compared to its in ter-cluster inertia. However in the case of a Kohonen clustering, as well as for many other numerical clustering methods, these measures are often strongly biased, mainly because the intrinsic dimensions of the clusters pr ofiles \(number of non-zero components in the codebook vectors describing the clusters\not of the same order of magnitude than the Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Coordinated Multiple Views in Explor atory Visualization \(CMV\22206 ISBN-10: 0-7695-2605-5/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE 


intrinsic dimensions of the data profiles 2 It is especially true in the documentary domain where the number of indexes in the documents is extremely low as compared to the dimension of their overall description space A promising way we have found to more precisely highlight the main characteristics of the clusters of the map and to validate the thematic deductions between the maps consists in coupling the MultiSOM model with a symbolic model using Galois lattice conceptual clustering of the patents regarding the same viewpoints as the one used for the map bu ilding. This approach is extensively describe A Galois lattice model can also be considered as a pure natural elementary classifier Indeed, it groups the data by directly considering their intrinsic properties \(i.e. withou t any preliminary construction of clusters pr ofiles\Hence, one might derive from its behavior news cluster quality evaluation factors which can be substitu ted to the measures of inertia for validating the intrinsic properties of the numerical clusters. For the sa ke of user-orientation, our proposed measures are based in a parallel way on the recall and precision criteria which are extensively used from evaluating the result quality of information retrieval IR\s. In IR, the Recall R represents the ratio between the number of relevant documents which have been returned by an IR system for a given query and the total number of relevant documents which should have been found in the documentary databa  Precision P represents the ratio between the number of relevant documents which ha ve been returned by an IR system for a given query and the total number of documents returned for the said query Recall and Precision generally behave in an antagonist way: as Recall increases Precision decreases, and conversely The F function has thus been proposed in order to highlight the best compromise between these two values 2  It is gi ve n by  000\013\000\f  PR PR F 000\016 000 2 Eq. 1 Based on the same principles, the Recall and Precision measures which we introduce hereafter evaluate the quality of a clustering method by measuring the relevance of the cluster content 3 in terms of shared properties. In our further descriptions, the cluster content is supposed to be represented by documents and the indexes \(i.e. the properties\ of the documents are supposed to be weighted by values within the range 000>\000 1,0  Let us consider a set of clusters C resulting from a clustering method applied on a set of documents D the local Recall Rec and Precision Prec\ measures for a given property p of the cluster c are expressed as 2 In the SOM method, a second bias is generated by the cluster construction process that tends to maintain the topographic properties of the map by enhancing the similarities between neighboring clusters 3 The content of a cluster is represented by the subset of original data that have been associated to it by the clustering process   Rec p p c C c p 000  c c p p c  Prec 000 Then, the averaged Recall  R  Precision  P  measures for the overall clustering can be expressed as 000\246\000\246 000\217 000\217 000 c Sp c Cc c p S C R Rec 11  000\246\000\246 000\217 000\217 000 c Sp c Cc c p S C P Prec 11 where S c is the set of properties which are peculiar to the cluster c that is described as 000\013\000\f 000\277 000\276 000\275 000\257 000\256 000\255 000 \000\217\000\217\000 000\217 Cc p p c c W MaxWcddpS c    where C represents the peculiar set of clusters extracted from the clusters of C  which verifies 000^\000 000\207\000z\000\217\000 c SCcC and 000\246\000\246 000\246 000\217\000\217 000\217 000 C cc d p d cd p d p c W W W  where represents the weight of the property p for element x p x W Similarly to IR, the F-measure described by Eq. 1 could be used to combine averaged Recall and Precision results. Moreover, we have demonstra ted in both values of averaged Recall and Precision reach the unity value, the peculiar set of clusters C represents a Galois lattice. Therefore, the combination of this two measures enables to evaluate to what extent a numerical clustering model can be assimilated to a Galois lattice natural classifier. The stability of our Quality criteria has also been demonstrated in 5.2 Evaluation results The examination of the Quality measures of the table 2 gives more reliable and stable results because these measures are both independent of the clustering method and of the size of the description space. It highlights the overall superiority of the viewpoint-oriented approach as compared with a global approach with the same number of clusters GlobMin  As soon as the number of clu sters is strongly increased in the global approach GlobMax  simultaneously increased, but the advantage of the viewpoint-oriented approach remains obvious in the average \(higher Average F-value on all viewpoints than F-value of GlobMax with a more reasonable number of nodes \(i.e. clusters\per maps fr om a user point of view The specific case of the Title clustering should be discussed here. The bad quality of this clustering is both Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Coordinated Multiple Views in Explor atory Visualization \(CMV\22206 ISBN-10: 0-7695-2605-5/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE 


due to the index sparseness of this field 4 and to an inappropriate number of clusters, relatively to the size of its associated description space. An interesting strategy would then be to make use of the quality factor Q in order to find the optimal number of clusters for this clustering. An unbalance between averaged Recall and Precision in the favour of averaged Recall be observed in the case of the worse clustering GlobMin and Titles Such an unbalance means that documents with different properties sets are grouped in the same clusters, leading conjointly to the risk of confusion in the interpretation of the content of the clusters by the user The quality analysis clearly shows that the viewpoint-oriented approach enhance the quality of interpretation of a cluster ing by both reducing the number of cluster to be consulted by the user on each viewpoint and providing him with more coherent and exhaustive clusters in terms of content 5.3 Optimisation of clustering results The quality criteria that have been presented in the latter section can also be used for optimizing the number of clusters for each viewpoint map. The goal of this process is to provide the anal yst with an optimal quality of interpretation for each individual map associated to a specific viewpoint. For that purpose, different maps are generated from 6x6 to 24*24 nodes \(clusters\for each viewpoint. The principle of our algorithm of clustering optimisation, which is described in break-even point i.e. intersection point\between averaged Recall and Precision The map whose quality criteria stand the nearest from the break-even point is considered as the opti mal one. Fig. 7 subjectively illustrates the difference of accuracy that can be obtained in the analysis by optimizing the map size for a given viewpoint. As it is shown in this figure, high quality maps are usually characterized by more precise topic labels and smaller average size of their logical areas 6. Mining knowledge with MultiSOM 6.1 Principles Data mining or knowledge discovery in database KDD\to the non-trivial process of discovering interesting, implicit, and previously unknown knowledge from large databases. Such a task implies to be able to perform analyses on high-dim ensional input data. The most popular models used in KDD are the symbolic models. The symbolic app roach to Database Contents Analysis is mostly based on the Galois lattice model see lattice L\(D,P is a conceptual hierarchy built up on a set of data D which are described by a set of properties P also called the intention \(Intent of the concept of the lattice. A class of the hierarchy, also  4 This can be \215a posteriori\216 confirmed by the inertia results for this viewpoint called "formal concept", is defined as a pair C  d,p where d denotes the extension \(Extent\pt i.e. a subset of D and p denotes the intention of the concept, i.e. a subset of P The lattice structure implies that it exists a partial order on a lattice such that 004\221 004\221 000\005 C 1 C 2 000\217 L  C 1 000d C 2 000\234 Extent C 1  000\216 Extent C 2  000\234 Intent C 1  000\213 Intent C 2  Association rules are one of the basic types of knowledge extraction from large databases. Given a database, the problem of mining association rules consists in generating all association rules that have certain user-specified minimum sup port and co nfidence An association rule is an expression A 000o B where A and B are conjunctions of properties. It means that if an individual data possesses all the properties of A then he necessarily possesses all the properties of B The support of the rule is supp  A 000\211 B nd the confidence Conf supp  A 000\211 B  supp  A An approach proposed by [21  shows that a subset of association rules can be obtained following the direct links of heritage between the concepts in the Galois lattice Unfortunately, symbolic models suffer of very serious limitations. Rule generation is a highly time-consuming process that generates a huge number of rules, including a large ratio of redundant rules. Hence, this prohibits any kind of rule computation and selection as soon as data are numerous and they are represented by very high-dimensional description space. This latter situation is very often encountered with documentary data. To cope with these problems, preliminary KDD trials using numerical models have been made. An algorithm for knowledge extraction from self-organizing network is proposed in This approach is based on a supervised generalized relevance learning vector quantization \(GRLVQ is used for extracting decision trees. The different paths of the generated trees are then used for denoting rules Nevertheless, the main defect of this method is to necessitate training data. An elaborated unsupervised neural model, like MultiSOM, represents a natural candidate to cope with th e related problems of rule inflation and rule selection that are inherent to symbolic methods. Hence, its synthesis capabilities that can be used both for reducing the number of rules and for extracting the most significan t ones. In this last section we propose a new approach for knowledge extraction that consists in using our MultiSOM model as a frontend for unsupervised extracti on of association rules. This approach will both exploit th e inter-map communication mechanism of the model and the recall and precision measures that have been describe d in the latter sections The general form of the extraction algorithm A between two viewpoints v 1 and v 2 follows 004\221 000\005 p 1 000\217 P c   000\005 p 2 000\217 P c  and c 000\217 v 1  c 000\217 v 2 1 If Rec p 1   p 2   p 1   p 2  Then Test_Rule_Type  2 ElseIf Rec p 1   p 2   p 2  Then Test_Rule_Type  Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Coordinated Multiple Views in Explor atory Visualization \(CMV\22206 ISBN-10: 0-7695-2605-5/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE

In this experiment optimal neurons for Advantages and Use viewpoints respectively, are generated. The experiment consists in extracting rules using th e extraction algorithmm A in combination with the in ter-map communication mechanism between the Advantages and the Use viewpoints. The communication is achieved between the original maps of each viewpoint, and furthermore between the same levels of generalization of each considered viewpoint. For each single communication step, the extraction algorithm is applied is a bidirectional way. Some examples of extracted rules are given hereafter R1 Natural oil Advantages 000o Catapult oil Use supp = 2, conf = 100 R2 Natural oil Advantages 000o 003\023 Drilling fluid Use supp = 2, conf = 100 As well as overall inter-map communication process map gives a global view of re lated topics described in the patents, such inter-map generated association rules more accurately highlight precise relationships and dependencies between concepts of patents domain A global summary of the results of the association rule extraction experiment is given in table 3. The table includes a comparison of our extraction algorithm with a standard symbolic rule extra ction method as regards to the amount of extracted rules. When our extraction algorithm is used with its optional steps, it is able to extract almost the same number of rules as a classical symbolic model that basically uses a combinatory approach. Indeed, table 3 shows that 601 rules of confidence 100% \(among 649 possible rules extracted. Even if, in this case, no rule selection is performed, the main advant age of this version of the algorithm, as compared to a classical symbolic method is the computation time. Indeed, as soon as our algorithm is cluster-based, the computa tion time is significantly reduced. Another interesting result is the behaviour of our extraction algorithm when it is used in its standard version \(without its optional steps\his case, a rule selection process is performed \(see table 3 Use 000l Advantages Total rule coun t 649 Avera g e confidence 100 Global rule coun t 2822 Symbolic model Average confidence 45 Peculiar rule coun t 200 Avera g e confidence 100 Extended rule coun t 601 MultiSOM 9 levels Average confidence 100 Table 3 Summary of multi-viewpoint mining results The table presents a basic comparison between the standard symbolic rule extraction method and the MultiSOM based rule extraction method. The global rule count defined for the symbolic model and the count of total rules \(confidence=100%\. The peculiar rule count is the count of rules obtained with the standard versions of the extraction algorithms. The extended rule count is the count of rules obtained with the extended version of the extraction algorithm including its optional steps 7. Conclusion We have presented a new self-organizing multi-map system called MultiSOM. We proposed it as a visualization-based system for scientific and technical information analysis, like paten ts analysis. The model that this multi-map environme nt provides is certainly not the map but in its or iginal extended version of intercommunication between multiples maps. Each map representing a particular vi ewpoint extracted from the data. Moreover, the viewpoints used in a given analysis can be easily adapted to the problem to be solved. We have exposed both the map generation and their intercommunication mechanism We finally showed how one can evaluate such a viewpoi nt-oriented approach by comparing it to a global clustering approach The advantages of the MultiSOM model for patents analysis seem obvious both in terms of objective evaluation, like the one we proposed, and for the domain experts: the original multiple viewpoints clustering approach of MultiSOM tends to reduce the noise which is inevitably generated in an overall clustering approach while increasing the flexibility and the granularity of the analyses. Moreover, with a gl obal clustering method even if this latter manag es overlapping clusters important relationships bet ween some subtopics are hidden in the cluster prof iles and therefore very difficult to precisely characterize Our experiment has also hi ghlighted that the quality evaluation factors we have proposed can be used for Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Coordinated Multiple Views in Explor atory Visualization \(CMV\22206 ISBN-10: 0-7695-2605-5/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE 


optimizing the clustering in terms of number of clusters either this clustering is global or it is viewpoint-oriented Finally, we have proposed a new approach for knowledge extraction that takes benefit of the MultiSOM environment. In the patents analysis domain, such knowledge extraction capability is mandatory to mine precise information from patents. Our approach makes uses of the MultiSOM inter-map communication mechanism in combination with original measures of recall and precision for extracting rules from maps. Even if complementary experiment s must be done, our first results are very promising. Th ey tend to prove that the MultiSOM model represents a natural candidate to cope with the related problems of rule inflation, rule selection and computation time that are inherent to symbolic models References   Campanario, J   M. \(1995 orks To Study Networks of Scientific Journals ics  Vol. 33  No. 1, p. 23-40   Cherfi, H  200 4 e et r\351alisation d\220un s y st\350me d\220extraction de connaissances \340 partir de textes.

Figure 4 Example of a generated map. Partial view of a topographic map of 10 x 10 nodes. The map is initially organized as a square 2D grid of nodes. The viewpoint chosen for the showed map is the Advantages viewpoint. The names of the clusters illustrate the topics \(considering the chosen viewpoint\ been highlighted by the learning. After the learning, the no des related to the same topics have been grouped into coherent areas thanks to the topographic properties of the map. The number of nodes of each area can then be considered as a good indicator of the topic weight in the database. Topics or areas near one to another represent related notions. For example, the \223 extending oil live 224 area shares some of its borders with the \223 black sludge control 224 area on the map.

ANNEX: example of interactive dynamic multi-viewpoint analysis Dynamic analysis takes place main ly by using the inter-map communication mechan ism which makes it possible to bring to successful conclusion sets of topics deductions between differen t viewpoints chosen like investigation under-fields. This a nalyze is based on the generation of an initia l activity corresponding to the premises of the deduction to check. According to stages of analyze, this activity can itself be generated several manners by the analyst on one or more source map. If the activity generation is d irectly operated by analyst on a map, it corresponds then to broad a set of topics question. If the activity generation is operated indirectly by projection query on a map or by activation of documents group stored befo rehand in a collector of documents, it corresponds then to more targeted question, which can intervene in one second stage of the analyze The analyst interest is to hi ghlight the specific areas of competence of the Exxon company. On the simulation of analysis we develop on figure 7, we will consider two different viewpoints Patentees which will represent the source of the analysis and the Title viewpoint which will represent its destination The analyst starts the process of deduction by generating an initial activity on the main Exxon topic i.e. Exxon area gravity center\ of the Patentees viewpoint map. To obtain a broad set of potential deductions, he selects the Possibilistic mode of deduction 17  The activity generated by the inter-map  communication mechanism on the Title viewpoint map is focused in two different zone s of this map, corresponding to two potential results In the first active zone \(1\, the analyst makes use two different naming strateg ies to facilitate its interpretation namely a naming strategy based on the profile of the topics more generic\ and a naming strategy based on the profile of the best members \(i.e. patents\of the topics more specific\. These operations enable him to highlight that the Exxon company is specialized in a correlative way on topics: \215 marine diesel engine 216 215 surfactant system 216 and \215 basic calcium compound 216 The expert checks the correlation between these topics by consulting the patents associated to the topic 215 surfactant system 216 \(2\. The title of the patents already confirm him the problematic de tected by the application A thorough examination of th e contents of the documents will show him than the pur pose of use of surfactant containing calcium in add ition with the normal formula of oils is to protect the combustion chambers of the marine diesel engines against corrosion due to the absorption of air charged out of salt during their operation. The problem of protection of the marine engines against corrosion is sufficiently important to represent a field of investigation for an oil manufacturer like Exxon The construction of a query containing the single descriptor \215 surfactant system 216 \(3\ on the Title viewpoint will allow the analyst 1 To validate the correlation between 215 surfactant system 216 and \215 marine diesel engine 216 topics which will be interpreted by the fact that 215 surfactant system 216 is only associated with 215 marine diesel engine 216 2 To check the inverse deduction 215 surfactant system 000\306 Exxon 216 which will insure him that Exxon is the only company whose interest in the conception of \215 surfactant system 216 The result of the projection of the query on the Title viewpoint map \(4\ shows that the generated activity is peculiar to the logical topic area \215 marine diesel engine 216, which confirms th e first assumption Simultaneously with projection the documents that are relevant for the query are presented in a Collector \(5 The global activation of these documents allows analyst to initiate a new de duction.  Then, the result of this latter can be examined on the Patentees map. Like only the main Exxon topic has been activated \(6\, the second assumption of the an alyst is confirmed The second active zone \(7\ generated by the initial process of deduction will allow the analyst to observe that the second major field of activity of Exxon is the 215 biodegradable 216 oils. It will be able to also note that these oils are more specifically us ed for the lubrication of the two-stroke engines \(\215 two cycle engine 216\ that generally reject much unburned oil Probabilistic mode of deduction will allow him to check if the inverse deduction, namely, that Exxon is the only company to be worked on biodegradable oils, can be validated \(8\. This process will lead the analyst to conclude that 215 biodegradable 216 oil manufacturing is shared between Exxon and Mobil companies \(9\, which are the most important oil manufacturers A complementary use of negative activity setting on the \215 two cycle engine 216 topic \(10\ will show more precisely to the analyst that that Mobil company mainly focus on manufacturing of biodegradable oils for \215two stroke engines\216 and, in a complementary way, that Mobil company only focus on manufacturing of biodegradable oils for \215four stroke engines\216 \(11 The simulation of analysis presented here above shows clearly how the analyst can make use of the MultiSOM functionalities in order to highlight all the privileged activity fields of the Exxon company starting from a patents database related to engineering of oils Main functionality is inter-map communication. Multiple naming strategies, generation of queries and collection intermediate results that have been implemented complementary to inter-map communication also play an important role in the analysis process Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Coordinated Multiple Views in Explor atory Visualization \(CMV\22206 ISBN-10: 0-7695-2605-5/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
