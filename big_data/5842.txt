Data matrix M called categories  A 1  A 2  and A 50 are examples of attributes in Figure 1 The Boolean attributes are derived from columns of data matrix M  Basic Boolean attributes are created 002rst The basic Boolean attribute is an expression of the form A  013  where 013 032 f a 1     a k g and f a 1     a k g is the set of categories of attribute A  The basic Boolean attribute A  013  is true in row o of M if it is A  o  2 013 where A  o  is a value of the attribute A in row o  Set 013 is called a coef\002cient of A  013   Boolean attributes are derived from basic Boolean attributes using propositional connectives _   and  in a usual way The rule  031  is true in data matrix M if the condition corresponding to 4ft-quanti\002er 031 is satis\002ed in a four-fold contingency table of  and  in M  otherwise  031  is false in M  The four-fold contingency table 4 f t    M  of  and  in data matrix M is a quadruple h a b c d i where a is the number of rows of M satisfying both  and   b is the number of rows of M satisfying  and not satisfying  etc see Table I TABLE I 4 FT TABLE 4 f t    M  OF  AND  IN M M         a  b     c  d There are various 4ft-quanti\002ers see e.g 6 W e use here a simple 4ft-quanti\002er i.e quanti\002er  p;B of founded implication  It is de\002ned for 0  p 024 1 and B  0 by the condition a  a  b 025 p  a 025 B  The association rule   p;B  means that at least 100 p per cent of rows of M satisfying  satisfy also  and that there are at least B rows of M satisfying both  and   We use this quanti\002er not only because of its simplicity but also because there are known deduction rules related to this quanti\002er We also use 4ft-quanti\002er 030  p;B of above average dependence de\002ned in for 0  p  B  0 by condition a  a  b 025 1  p  a  c  a  b  c  d  a

PPLYING 4 FT M INER We use 4ft-Miner procedure to mine for association rules introduced in section III 4ft-Miner is an implementation of the GUHA method introduced in it does not use apriori algorithm A set of relevant association rules to be veri\002ed can be thus tuned in a 002ne way and analytical questions concerning general relations of general attributes can be tackled Examples of an analytical question a corresponding set of relevant association rules and resulting set of true association rules are in sections IV-A IV-B and IV-C respectively A Analytical Question We are going to solve analytical question In the data matrix Entry  are there any interesting relations between combinations of personal characteristics and problems of patients on one side and results of his examinations on the other side However we are not interested in consequences of the known fact that if BMI increases then diastolic blood pressure increases too We deal with association rules thus we convert our question to a question concerning association rules Symbolically we can express a converted question as  Entry  not consequence of BMI  Diastolic   B  Personal   B  Problems  030  B  Examinations   Here B Personal  means a set of all Boolean attrib utes derived from attributes of the group Personal we consider relevant to our analytical question similarly for B  Problems  and B  Examinations   B Relevant Association Rules This analytical question means that we search rules  P e   P r 031  E which are true in data matrix Entry  cannot be understood as consequences of BMI  Diastolic   P e 2 B  Personal    P r 2 B  Problems   and  E 2 B  Examinations   In addition 031 is a suitable 4ft-quanti\002er Remember that  P e   P r is antecedent of searched rules A possibility to de\002ne the set of relevant antecedents to solve our analytical question is shown in an upper part of Figure 2 Set B Personal  is de\002ned in ro w Personal Conj 1-4 and in four consecutive rows Each  P e is a conjunction of 1 4 basic Boolean attributes derived from particular attributes of the group Personal  Set of basic Boolean attributes derived from attribute Marital  Status is de\002ned by the row Marital_Status\(subset 1-1 B pos  It means that all basic Boolean attributes Marital  Status  013  where 013 is a subset of all categories of attribute Marital  Status containing 1 1 categories are generated Marital  Status  married  Marital  Status  divorced  Marital  Status  single  and Marital  Status  widower  Set of basic Boolean attributes derived from attribute Responsibility is de\002ned similarly Set of basic Boolean attributes derived from attribute Education is de\002ned by the row Education\(int 1-2 B pos  Thus all 7 basic Boolean attributes Education

attributes derived from attribute BMI is de\002ned by the row BMI\(int 1-4 B pos  It means that all Boolean attributes BMI  013  where 013 is a set of 1-4

Fig 3 De\002nition of atomic consequences i There is no AC among 123 output rules ii There is no rule among 123 output rules logically following from a particular AC iii There is an output rule denoted R 1  BMI 24 26 i  HF  0  875  42 Diastolic h 70 100  HF denotes Hyperlipidemia  yes   Infarction  yes  Atomic consequence BMI 24 26 i  0  875  42 Diastolic h 70 100 denoted AC 1  is created from the rectangle A medium 002 S medium  It can be easy proved that R 1 does not logically follow from AC 1 4 However rule R 1 says nothing new interesting in addition to AC 1  R 1 concerns patients satisfying BMI 24 26 i  HF antecedent of R 1  i.e a subset of patients satisfying BMI 24 26 i antecedent of AC 1  Thus we 002lter the rule R 1 out More rules can be 002ltered out due to analogous reasons iv There is an output rule denoted R 2  BMI 24 28 i  MUH  0  865  32 Diastolic h 80 110 where MUH means Marital  Status  married   Education  university   Hypertension  yes  There is an atomic consequence we denote it AC 2  BMI 24 28 i  0  865  32 Diastolic h 80 100 created from rectangle A medium 002 S medium  see section V-A Rule BMI 24 28 i  0  865  32 Diastolic h 80 110 we denote it R 3  logically follows from AC 2  However rule R 2 says nothing new interesting in addition to R 3 and thus we 002lter rule R 2 out We outline why the rule R 3 logically follows from AC 2  In Figure 4 there are 4fttables 4 f t  BMI 24 28 i  Diastolic h 80 100  M  of BMI 24 28 i and Diast h 80 100 i.e of AC 2  and 4 f t  BMI 24 28 i  Diast h 80 110  M  of BMI 24 28 i and Diast h 80 110 i.e of R 3  in a general data matrix M with columns corresponding to attributes BMI and Diastolic  It is a  b  a 0  b 0  Each patient satisfying Diastolic h 80 100 satisfy also Diastolic h 80 110 and thus a 0 025 a and b 0 024 b which means that if a  a  b 025 0  865  a 025 30 then also a 0  a 0  b 0 025 0  865  a 0 025 30  The 4ft-Miner procedure has tools for 002ltering out rules M  Diastolic h 80 100   Diastolic h 80 100  BMI 24 28 i  a  b   BMI 24 28 i  c  d 4 f t  BMI 24 28 i  Diastolic h 80 100  M  M  Diastolic h 80 110   Diastolic h 80 110  BMI 24 28 i  a 0  b 0   BMI 24 28 i  c 0  d 0 4 f t  BMI 24 28 i  Diastolic h 80 110  M  Fig 4 Two contingency tables according to points i iv They were used to 002lter out 97 rules consequences of BMI  Diastolic for data matrix Entry and 4ft-quanti\002er  0  85  30  VI I NTERPRETING R EMAINING R ULES There are 26 remaining association rules 16 of them have form   p;Base Systolic  016   Thus we ask if they can be considered as consequences of a possibly new item BMI  Systolic of knowledge saying that if BMI increases then Systolic increases too see section VI-A We assume here that BMI  Diastolic is the only known item of knowledge which is of course false Remarks to remaining 10 rules together with a summary of results are in section VI-B A Consequences of BMI  Systolic We use the approach described in section V to identify possible consequences of BMI  Systolic  We de\002ne a set Cons  BMI  Systolic  Entry   0  85  30  of atomic consequences of BMI  Systolic for data matrix Entry and 4ft-quanti\002er  0  85  30 as a set of all rules BMI  low   p;B Systolic  low   BMI  medium   p;B Systolic  medium   BMI  high   p;B Systolic  high   where p 025 0  85 and Base 025 30  We use the same de\002nitions of coef\002cients low  medium  and high for attribute BMI and similar de\002nitions of these coef\002cients for attribute Systolic as for Diastolic  Attribute Systolic has 9 categories h 90 110  h 110 120      h 170 180  h 180 220  see section II We de\002ne Systolic  low  by condition low 022 fh 90 110      h 130 140 g  Systolic  medium  by medium 022 fh 120 130      h 150 160 g and Systolic  high  by high 022 fh 140 150      h 180 220 g  Then we use the corresponding rectangles as in section V-A and the approach described in section V-B This way we identify all 16 rules with form of   p;Base Systolic  016  as consequences of BMI  Systolic  B Particular True Rules and Summary There are 10 particular remaining rules Succedent of 002ve of them is Diastolic h 80 110 and succedent of 002ve additional rules is Diastolic h 70 110  Antecedents of all 10 rules contain 1\2262 attributes from the group Personal and 1\2262 attributes from the group Education  no antecedent contains attribute BMI  All these rules seems to be uninteresting We can summarize that among 123 resulting rules there are 97 rules which can be understood as consequences of the 


known item BMI  Diastolic of domain knowledge 16 rules which can be understood as consequences of a new item of knowledge BMI  Systolic and 10 additional uninteresting rules VII M INING FOR E XCEPTIONS The consequences of BMI  Diastolic are identi\002ed by pairs of Boolean attributes BMI  low  Diastolic  low  BMI  medium  Diastolic  medium  BMI  high  Diastolic  high  which are used to build suitable atomic consequences We outline a possibility to use pair BMI  low  Diastolic  high  to mine for exceptions from the relation BMI  Diastolic  We use the same set of relevant association rules as introduced in section IV-B However we use the 4ft-quanti\002er 030  3  26  30 of above average dependence see end of section III instead of 4ft-quanti\002er  0  85  30  A corresponding run of the 4ft-Miner procedure results in 602 true rules The tools used to 002lter out atomic consequences of BMI  Diastolic can also be used to identify rules with BMI  low  in antecedent and Diastolic  high  in succedent There are several such rules all of them can be understood as possible exceptions from BMI  Diastolic  An example is the rule we denote it R  BMI  024 23  000 030  3  33  30 Diastolic  025 100  003 with 4ft table 4 f t  BMI  024 23  000  Diastolic  025 100  003  Entry  shown in Figure 5 We write Dt instead of Diastolic  000 Entry  Dt  025 100  003    Dt  025 100  003  BMI  024 23  000  30  190    BMI  024 23  000  14  1162 4 f t  BMI  024 23  000  Diastolic  025 100  003  Entry  Fig 5 4ft-table of the rule R abbreviates Marital  Status  married   Education  secondary school   Hypertension  yes   Hyperlipidemia  yes  and 003 denotes Systolic h 170 220  Cholesterol h 200 280  Rule R says that relative frequency of patients satisfying Diastolic  025 100  003 among patients satisfying BMI  024 23  000 i.e 30  30+190  is 333 per cent higher than relative frequency of patients satisfying Diastolic  025 100  003 among all patients i.e 30+14  30+190+14+1162 and that there are 30 patients satisfying both BMI  024 23  000 and Diastolic  025 100  003  We can say that relative frequency of patients with high diastolic blood pressure is under special circumstances for some patients with low BMI much higher than we can expect However the more detailed analysis of this exception does not cope with the extent of this paper We only pointed at a way which can lead to possible interesting exceptions VIII C ONCLUSIONS AND F URTHER W ORK We presented a new approach to deal with domain knowledge and semantics in association rules mining We deal with association rules 226 interesting pairs of general Boolean attributes Interestingness of a rule is expressed by conditions concerning contingency table of both Boolean attributes The approach is based on formalized items of domain knowledge which are converted to sets of simple association rules called atomic consequences All reasonable consequences of a given item of domain knowledge are then identi\002ed deduction rules concerning association rules are used Such sets of consequences can be used to 002lter out uninteresting rules as well as to start of searching for new items of domain knowledge However the second task requires a lot of additional work We used the procedure 4ft-Miner It is a part of the LISpMiner system which has tools for dealing with sets of consequences These tools can be used also for searching for a special type of exceptions which differs from that introduced in We used here only one type of items of domain knowledge namely the item BMI  Diastolic  Let us emphasize that there are several additional types of mutual in\003uence of attributes  An e xample is Education  BMI which says that if education increases then BMI decreases All these types of knowledge can be treated in the above described way W e assume to enhance presented experiment to additional types of domain knowledge The whole approach seems to be understandable from the of point view of a domain expert However a detailed explanation will be useful This leads to necessity to prepare for each analytical question an analytical report explaining in details all steps leading to its solution There are 002rst results in producing similar reports and presenting them on Internet A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described here has been supported by Grant No 201/08/0802 of the Czech Science Foundation and

When we do and operation on the candidate sets we can use apriori_gen algorithm to filter to reduce the counts of and operation and improve efficiency V. EXPERIMENT We use the classical data set, Mushroom Database as test data. This data set includes 8124 instances, 23 attributes and 127 kinds of values. When the support degree is large the Apriori algorithm takes little running time. However, the improved algorithm takes less time than it. With the reduction of the support degree, the performance of the improved algorithm will be better We use a data set including 8124 instances to do simulation experiment. Figure 1 shows that the time needed by the two algorithms under different support degrees Figure 2 shows that the performance of two algorithms under different records.

associated category in the rule database. Thus, each email should be classified into one category predefined If a unlabeled email can not fit all rules in the rule database, we will label it as unrecognized-mail. After labeled it by manual, a re-training will be performed, to update the rules database 4. Experimental Results Then, we arrange 1000 Chinese emails for the experiment, which are composed of 500 spam emails and 500 legitimate mails, all of them are labeled sexual, political advertising, personal, or working by manual. We take 800 emails as training samples, and 200 emails as test samples. In our experiment, the number of attributes extraction is 30. The experimental result of this research is recorded in Table 3 TABLE 3.

Conclusions In this paper, we propose an efficient email classification method based on decision tree data mining technique. We dig out the association rules among specific features in the email and apply these rules to label unknown emails category Different from those methods of checking the complete content of email, we judge email simply by its attributes without screening overall content of email. Obviously according to the datum of experiment, the efficiency of the method proposed in this paper is not lower than that of other present methods of checking email content. Meanwhile our method reduces the cost of computation and it wont

could be applied as well as the proposed algorithm VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules extracted. We also proved the redundancy defmition of the rule based on the CF\(certainty factor algorithm was evaluated through numerical experiments using benchmark data, "Abalone". From the results, the method was found to be promising in terms of computational time and redundant rule pruning.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
