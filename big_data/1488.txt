Existing research\non MapReduce in opportunistic environment has focused on\nimproving single job performance; the issue of fairness that is\ncritical in the more dominant scenario of multiple concurrent\njobs remains unexplored. We address this problem by proposing\nan opportunistic fair scheduling algorithm, which extends the\nbroadly adopted Fair Scheduler to an environment where nodes\nare intermittently available with possibly different availability\npatterns. The proposed scheduler maintains statistics specific to\nthe opportunistic environment, e.g., node availability rates and\npairwise availability correlations, and utilizes this information in\nscheduling decisions to improve fairness. Using a Hadoop-based\nimplementation, we compare our scheduler with the current\nHadoop Fair Scheduler on representative benchmarks. Our\nexperiments verify that our scheduler can significantly reduce\nthe variability in job completion times.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCloud computing systems typically experience highly dy-\nnamic workloads due to rapidly changing usage of cloud users.\nAs the cloud provider needs to plan capacity according to the\nmaximum loads during peak hours, there is a significant sur-\nplus of available resources on off-peak times, leading to under-\nutilization and lost profit. Meanwhile, the surging interest in\nbig data analytics calls for new methods to provision massively\nscalable resources at very low cost, although the requirement\non response time is typically flexible. The convergence of these\ntwo phenomena inspires us to investigate the possibility of\nrunning data analytics jobs in the background of normal cloud\ncomputing jobs with Quality of Service \(QoS multiplexing high-priority and low-priority jobs\nto improve resource utilization has been studied in the regime\nof volunteer computing, where a computing grid with intermit-\ntently available resources is formed by harvesting idle periods\nof commodity computers distributed over the Internet. Similar\nidea is also used by Amazon EC2 to provide a new type of\nservice called Spot Instances [1], which allows customers to\nbid on unused EC2 resources.\nA major hurdle in deploying such a solution is the schedul-\ning of the low-priority jobs. In order to minimize interference\nThis work was supported in part by the National Institute of Standards\nand Technology/IBM and the National Science Foundation under Grant CNS-\n1135844.\non the high-priority jobs, the low-priority jobs must yield\nresources upon detecting a surge in the frontend activities,\nwhich makes resources available to the low-priority jobs\nhighly intermittent and volatile.\nFor data analytics jobs in such an opportunistic environment,\nMapReduce [2] stands out as a compelling programming\nmodel due to its built-in support of fault tolerance and mas-\nsive parallelism. One of the open-source implementation of\nMapReduce called Hadoop [3], has been broadly applied to\nbig data analytics in dedicated clusters. The original fault tol-\nerance capability in Hadoop only considers software/hardware\nfailures which are rare but persistent Recently, there have\nbeen studies on extending this capability to handle frequent\nbut transient interruptions as experienced in an opportunistic\nenvironment [4], [5]. The focus in these studies is to improve\nthe execution of a single MapReduce job; the important prob-\nlem of fair sharing between multiple jobs has been ignored.\nFairness has been a key objective of MapReduce scheduling\nin a multi-user environment [6], and Hadoop Fair Scheduler\n\(HFS  dedicated homogeneous resources\nand may perform poorly in an opportunistic environment,\nwhere nodes typically exhibit different resource availability\npatterns due to their different frontend loads, even if the\nhardware capabilities are homogeneous.\nAnother limitation of existing solutions [4], [5] is that they\ncannot distinguish failures caused by faults from interruptions\ncaused by busy periods. This is because these solutions\nare primarily designed for volunteer computing environment,\nwhere a third-party component manages resource availability\nto all grid applications. The cloud environment provides more\nintegrated management that allows the management system to\ninform Hadoop of normal interruptions, which opens up room\nfor further optimization. Note that although we motivate the\nneed of interruptions by busy periods, our solution applies\nto any transient resource shortage, e.g., due to fluctuations in\npower generated by alternative energy sources.\nIn this paper, we make a first attempt at addressing these\nlimitations by enhancing Hadoop with the awareness of dy-\nnamic node availability and designing a simple extension of\nHFS to improve fairness in an opportunistic environment. Our\nmain contributions are:\n• Design and implement interruption handling and learning\n2013 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Cloud Computing\n978-0-7695-5028-2/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/CLOUD.2013.84\n9\nof node availability statistics within Hadoop;\n• Design and implement an 


opportunistic fair scheduling\nalgorithm using learned node availability statistics;\n• Evaluate the proposed scheduler against HFS on repre-\nsentative benchmarks and characterize the conditions for\nfairness improvement.\nIn particular, we observe that the level of parallelism, the\ntask duration, the heterogeneity in node availability, and the\nfrequency of availability changes all affect the fairness im-\nprovement. With moderate-sized workloads, our scheduler can\nachieve up to 50% better fairness in job performance measured\nby completion times; we expect the improvement to be even\ngreater for larger workloads.\nWe acknowledge that in addition to node availability, vari-\nations in hardware capabilities can also be a source of het-\nerogeneity that can cause performance degradation of existing\nHadoop schedulers, as recognized in [8]. In this paper we\nonly consider nodes with homogeneous hardware to focus\non the heterogeneity caused by different node availability\npatterns. Our solution can be combined with solutions in [8]\nand followups to provide fairness in a general opportunistic\nenvironment with possibly heterogeneous hardware.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II\nprovides the background of Hadoop and Section III illustrates\nissues with HFS. Section IV and Section V describe our\nscheduler design and implementation, respectively. Section VI\npresents the experiment results. Finally, Section VII reviews\nthe related work, and Section VIII concludes the paper.\nII BACKGROUND\nMapReduce [2] has attracted tremendous attention lately\ndue to its perfect fit for big data analytics and easy-to-manage\nprogramming interface [2]. There are only two functions the\nprogrammer has to define: map, which processes one piece of\ninput data to generate intermediate results, and reduce which\ncombines the intermediate results to produce the final output.\nIn this paper, we explore MapReduce scheduling in Hadoop,\nan open source MapReduce implementation. We start with a\nbrief introduction to Hadoop and its current scheduler.\nA. Hadoop\nHadoop [3] is an open source implementation of the MapRe-\nduce framework It primarily consists of Hadoop Distributed\nFile System \(HDFS for managing computation. HDFS is a shared\nstorage consisting of one master node, called NameNode and\nmultiple slave nodes, called DataNodes. NameNode manages\nthe global file system namespace and controls operations on\nfiles, while DataNodes perform actual operations on local data.\nHadoop MapReduce also employs a master/slave architecture.\nThe master, called JobTrakcer, manages a queue of submitted\njobs, and decides when and where to execute each task of\nthese jobs. The slaves, called TaskTrackers, manage the actual\nexecution of tasks. When data are uploaded to HDFS, they\nare partitioned into blocks \(typically 64 MB per block then stored across DataNodes and replicated for a given\nnumber of times \(3 by default submitted,\nJobTracker associates each map task with certain input data\nblocks and assigns map tasks to slaves according to the current\nscheduler. Similarly, JobTracker assigns reduce tasks to slaves\naccording to the scheduler after the map tasks are \(partially phases:\nshuffle phase where the intermediate data generated by map\ntasks are fetched to the local node, sort phase, where the\nfetched data are sorted by their key values, and reduce phase,\nwhere a given reduce function is executed on the sorted\nintermediate data.\nB. Hadoop Fair Scheduler \(HFS  state-of-the-art MapReduce scheduler\ndesigned to ensure fair sharing of resources among multiple\njobs1 by guaranteeing that each job, on the average over time,\nreceives an equal share of resources. Its implementation in\nHadoop, called Hadoop Fair Scheduler \(HFS  currently\nreceiving the least share of resources in each scheduling\ndecision. As Hadoop manages resources at the granularity of\nslots 2, HFS uses the number of slots as the metric for resource\nshare, and always schedules jobs with fewer numbers of\nrunning tasks first. Note that HFS also allows the specification\nof a minimum share to support QoS requirements. We ignore\nthis option in this paper as it is irrelevant to fairness.\nIII. PROBLEM WITH HFS IN AN OPPORTUNISTIC\nENVIRONMENT\nAlthough the simplistic measure of task slots seems to\nsuffice for a dedicated \(homogeneous characteristics of an opportunistic\nenvironment. Due to constant interruptions by high-priority\nworkflows nodes in an opportunistic Hadoop cluster do not\nprovide equal speeds to MapReduce jobs. Therefore simply\nallocating resources according to the number of task slots\nreceived by each job can result in significant unfairness due to\nthe negligence of different node availability patterns. Below we\nuse two examples to illustrate how dynamic node availability\ncan impact the performance of both map and reduce tasks.\nFor map tasks, consider the four candidate map hosts with\ndifferent availabilities as shown in Fig. 1 Node1 and Node2\nhave 10 available time slots3 out of 13, while Node3 and\nNode4 only have 4 available time slots in the same period.\nFor simplicity, assume that each node only has one map\nslot. Suppose that two identical jobs, Job1 and Job2, arrive\nat time 0 and 1, respectively; each job has three map tasks,\neach requiring two time slots of processing. At time 0, Job1\nreceives the available slots on Node3 and Node4 as the only\njob. After Job2 arrives, HFS continuously assigns the slots\navailable on Node1, Node2, and again Node1 to 


Job2 at time\n1, 2, and 3, since Job2 has fewer running tasks than Job1 at\n1The design also considers fair sharing among pools of jobs. We only focus\non job level fairness in this paper as the solution will be analogous for pools.\n2Slot is a fixed fraction of a slave’s capacity suitable for running one task.\n3The time slot is used to denote the minimum time interval between\navailability changes, which is not to be confused with the task slot.\n10\ntime\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nNode2\nAvailable period\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nJob1 execution\nxx\nxx\nxx Job2 execution nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n7 8 9 10 11 12 13\ntime\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nNode1\n7 8 9 10 11 12 13xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nTask1 of Job2 Task3 of Job2\ntime\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nNode3\n7 8 9 10 11 12 13xxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nTask1 of Job1\ntime\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nNode4\n7 8 9 10 11 12 13\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nTask3 of Job1\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nTask2 of Job2\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\nTask2 of Job1\nFig. 1.

Example: Availability correlation between map and reduce hosts can\ninfluence the performance.\nthese decision moments. Finally, at time 4, Job1 receives the\nmap slot on Node4. This schedule results in completion times\nof 10 time slots for Job1 and 4 time slots for Job2, leading\nto significant unfairness. However, if we schedule differently,\ne.g., scheduling Task3 of Job1 onto Node1 at time 3 and\nTask3 of Job2 onto Node4 at time 4, then Job1 will finish\nin 7 time slots and Job2 in 9 time slots. Intuitively, the latter\ncase achieves better fairness.\nFor reduce tasks, besides the local availability of reduce\nhost correlation with the hosts of the corresponding map\ntasks also influence performance, as the shuffle phase can\nonly proceed when both map and reduce hosts are available.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, suppose that two jobs, Job1 and Job2,\neach has one reduce task waiting to be scheduled. In addition,\nsuppose that the map phases for both jobs have completed,\nwith the intermediate data of Job1 stored at Map result\nhost1 and that of Job2 at Map result host2. Assume that the\nnext two scheduling opportunities for reduce tasks occur at\nCandidate reduce host1 \(time 0 time 1 competent in receiving the reduce slot \(both having\nzero reduce task running HFS\nschedules the reduce task of Job2 onto Candidate reduce\nhost1 and that of Job1 onto Candidate reduce host2, leading\nto delayed completion for both jobs due to the difficulty in\nshuffling data from Map result host2 to Candidate reduce\nhost1 and Map result host1 to Candidate reduce host2. This\nis because in an opportunistic environment, the shuffle phase\nof reduce task can only make progress when both map result\nhost and reduce host are simultaneously available. Clearly, a\nbetter schedule can be obtained by considering the correlation\nbetween the candidate reduce host and the hosts of map tasks.\nFrom the above observations, we identify two factors that\nare ignored by HFS but can significantly affect job perfor-\nmance in an opportunistic environment. First, only balancing\nthe number of occupied task slots per job is insufficient for fair\nresource allocation. Instead, a refined metric should be used\nto capture the heterogeneous availability of nodes. Second,\nthe interdependence between map and reduce tasks has more\nprominent performance impact in an opportunistic environ-\nment due to the requirement of simultaneous map/reduce host\navailability during the 


shuffle phase. With these insights, we\ndevelop an Opportunistic Fair Scheduler to incorporate these\nfactors into scheduling decisions.\nIV. OPPORTUNISTIC FAIR SCHEDULER\nTo address the issues mentioned above, we propose an ex-\ntension to HFS, called Opportunistic Fair Scheduler \(OFS in an opportunistic\nenvironment. We first introduce two notions, fractional task\nslot and availability correlation, based on the observations in\nSection III, and then present the algorithm of OFS.\nA. Fractional Task Slot\nTo deal with the issue in Fig. 1, we differentiate the slots\nacross nodes by weights indicating the actual amount of\nresources each slot can denote to MapReduce tasks. To this\nend, we introduce a few notions as follows.\n1 unavailable”, to\nindicate the instantaneous availability of a node for executing\nMapReduce tasks; denote the availability state of node n at\ntime t by an\(t application specific. For example, the resource\nrequirement of the frontend application together with system\ncapacity can be used to jointly determine a threshold on\nthe critical resources utilization, above which the node is\nconsidered busy and thus “unavailable” for MapReduce tasks.\n2 dynamically changing availabil-\nity states, there are multiple ways to assign weights to task\nslots, e.g., the slowdown factor \(the ratio of the execution\ntimes in a dedicated environment and an opportunistic environ-\nment recent task. Here we adopt\nthe availability rate defined as follows as a starting point; the\nstudy of more sophisticated metrics is left to future work \(see\ndiscussions in Section VI-C the availability rate is\nto compute the fraction of available time in a cumulative or\nsliding window, although such a method tends to be vulnerable\nto stretched available/unavailable periods. We use a different\nevaluation as follows, where the function AvgAvaPeriod\(0, t AvgUnavaPeriod\(0, t avail-\nable \(unavailable t until time\nt is defined as:\nr\(t 0, t 0, t 0, t 1 i.i.d. available and\nunavailable periods, respectively.\n3 of\ntask slots occupied by each job, OFS tries to balance the total\nweight per job computed based on all its running tasks as\nbelow, where each task slot is weighted by the availability\nrate of its hosting node. This total weight, referred to as the\nfractional share of the job, replaces running task slots as the\nnew measure of resource in our scheduler design.\nDefinition 2: Suppose S is the set of running map \(or\nreduce job j, and rk\(t fractional\nshare sj\(t or reduce t rk\(t MapReduce jobs in an opportunistic environ-\nment due to the possible problem of starvation, where a reduce\ntask occupying a reduce slot has to wait for the map hosts\nto become available in order to obtain the intermediate data.\nThus, careful selection of an appropriate slot to execute each\nreduce task becomes essential. Intuitively, assigning reduce\ntasks to nodes whose available periods are aligned with those\nof nodes hosting the intermediate data can speed up the shuffle\nphase. In contrast, running a reduce task on a node whose\navailable periods do not overlap with the available periods of\nthe map hosts can significantly slow down the shuffle phase.\nJointly selecting map and reduce hosts to maximize the\noverlap between their available periods is a natural way to\nimprove MapReduce performance. This overlap is computed\nthrough the pairwise correlation of node availability histories.\nSpecifically, each node maintains a sliding window of size\nW to record the most recent W values of its availability state.\nOur scheduler then uses the average correlation defined below,\nbetween the availability histories of each node pair to measure\nthe level of synchronization of their available periods.\nDefinition 3: Let the vector histm := [am\(t ? W + 1 t?W +2 t the availability history of node\nm at time t. The pairwise availability correlation between\nnodes m and n at this time is defined as:\nc\(m, n k k 2 are simultaneously\navailable during the recorded history.\nSince a job may have intermediate data at multiple nodes,\nwe use the average pairwise correlation between the host of\nthe reduce slot and the host of each piece of intermediate\ndata \(generated by a map task the reduce slot. Formally, we\ndefine the map-reduce correlation as follows.\nDefinition 4: Let S denote the set of scheduled \(running or\nfinished reduce slot is available on node m, then\nthe map-reduce correlation for allocating this slot to job j is\ndefined as:\nCm\(j m, nk 3 the algorithm in OFS. The\nalgorithm is similar in structure to HFS, except that the\nmeasure of resource share 


is changed from integral slots to\nfractional slots as defined in Section IV-A. We also provide an\noptional component called Correlation Scheduling to improve\navailability correlation for reduce tasks.\nAlgorithm 1 Opportunistic Fair Scheduler\nRequire: J : the set of active jobs\n1: if a heartbeat is received from node n then\n2: for each free slot on n do\n3: for each job j ? J , compute the fractional share of\nthe corresponding map/reduce j ? J , compute the map-reduce\ncorrelation for allocating this slot to job j\n6: end if\n7: sort J using the comparator in Algorithm 2\n8: schedule the first suitable task in sorted J onto4 n\n9: end for\n10: end if\nSpecifically, as shown in Algorithm 1, when a node asks\nfor a new map/reduce task, OFS first computes the fractional\nshare of map/reduce slots for each candidate job \(i.e., active\njobs with this type of tasks to be scheduled further computes the map-reduce correlation\nfor all candidate jobs with pending reduce tasks. With this\ninformation, it sorts all candidate jobs according to priority,\nfractional share, map-reduce correlation only for reduce task\nunder Correlation Scheduling In Algorithm 2, we can see that the current\ndesign of OFS only considers map-reduce correlation when\nthe fractional share cannot differentiate two jobs. In general,\nthere is a tradeoff between fairness and efficiency \(i.e., job exe-\ncution time therefore improve the efficiency, scheduling\n\(reduce tasks also considers data locality in scheduling map tasks by incorporating\nthe Delay Scheduling mechanism proposed in [8].\n12\nfairness. Since our main purpose in this work is to improve\nthe fairness among MapReduce jobs, the proposed scheduler\ngives strict priority to the fairness measure \(fractional share as a tie breaker.\nAlgorithm 2 Opportunistic Fair Comparator\nRequire: Jobs job1, job2 and their attributes priority, frac-\ntional share, map-reduce correlation, start time map/reduce then\n2: schedule the job with a higher priority first\n3: else\n4: if fractional share of job1 = fractional share of job2\nthen\n5: schedule the job with less fractional share first\n6: else\n7: if Correlation Scheduling is enabled and task type is\nreduce and map-reduce correlation of job1 = map-\nreduce correlation of job2 then\n8: schedule the job with higher correlation first\n9: else\n10: schedule the job with earlier start time first\n11: end if\n12: end if\n13: end if\nV. IMPLEMENTATION\nIn this section, we describe the implementation details of\nOFS proposed in Section IV. Our implementation mainly con-\ntains two parts: \(a handling, and \(b functionalities in the\ncore of Hadoop to support the handling of interruptions and\nlearning/sharing of node availability statistics. Compared with\nthe existing solution of interrupting all Hadoop processes from\nthe outside [4], [5], our approach has two benefits: \(i caused\nby busy period and an abnormal interruption caused by node\nfailure; \(ii system as we can\napply the interruption only to the workloads and maintain an\ninterruption-free environment for the management processes.\nIn particular, Hadoop employs a set of deamon processes for\nmanagement operations \(e.g., health check, scheduling, fault\ntolerance cluster but\nlight on resource consumption. Thus, we restrict interruptions\nto MapReduce tasks to seamlessly integrate with Hadoop man-\nagement in dedicated environments while achieving the goal\nof yielding resources to high-priority applications on demand.\nBelow we describe the key components in our interruption\nhandling system.\n1 the responsibility\nof detecting interruptions \(as well as the end of interruptions execution accordingly, and updat-\ning the relevant statistics. We implement this by adding a\nnew thread to TaskTracker, named Availability State Monitor,\nwhich periodically updates the availability state of the local\nnode by checking for availability signals. For testing purpose,\nwe use a pipe on each node to signal the availability state,\ne.g., it will contain 1 for “available” if the node is lightly\nloaded and 0 for unavailable” otherwise, but our design is\neasily extensible to other types of signaling.\nAfter each update to the availability state, Availability State\nMonitor notifies the TaskTracker to take appropriate actions;\nmeanwhile, it also maintains a set of availability statistics,\nincluding the average length of available/unavailable periods,\nthe availability rate \(see Definition 1 see Definition 3 series of actions as follows.\nIf the state is “unavailable”, the TaskTracker suspends all\nits child processes which perform the actual execution of\ntasks [9]. Meanwhile, it prepares a heartbeat message to notify\nJobTracker of the new availability state, in which it also\nindicates that it is unable to accept new 


tasks \(by setting the\nheartbeat field acceptNewTasks to false TaskTracker resumes the suspended child\nprocesses if any, notifies JobTracker of its new availability\nstate and asks for new tasks if the node has empty slots.\n2 Availability\nState Monitor can only handle interruptions on the local node.\nFor reduce tasks in the shuffle phase, we also need to be aware\nof the availability states on map hosts to avoid interfering with\nhigh-priority applications on these nodes. We implement this\nby making the reduce task periodically \(in our tests, we set\nthis period to 1 second to promptly detect remote interruptions state of the map host during the shuffle\nphase, and only proceed with shuffling when the map host\nis available. To obtain the availability information of remote\nnodes, we implement an Availability State Communication\nSystem among JobTracker, TaskTracker and ReduceTask that\nworks as follows.\nThrough TaskTrackerStatus, TaskTracker reports its avail-\nability state to JobTracker, which maintains a table called\nTrackerToAvailabilityState to record the availability state of\neach node. In the response to heartbeat JobTracker informs\nthe TaskTracker of the following two tables: the updated\nTrackerToAvailabilityState and a second table called TaskId-\nToTracker, which contains the mapping between all scheduled\ntasks and their hosts During the shuffle phase, a reduce task\nperiodically sends a request with the targeted map task ID to its\nTaskTracker to check the availability state of the map host. The\nTaskTracker extracts this state by looking up TaskIdToTracker\nand TrackerToAvailabilityState tables, and then responds to the\nrequesting reduce task with this information. The reduce task\nonly proceeds when the map host becomes available \(if the\n13\nfirst check returns “unavailable”, the reduce task will repeat\nthe request at fixed intervals, currently set to 1 second hierarchical resource allocation framework\nthat can support any scheduling algorithm based on the or-\ndering of “schedulables”, i.e., resource consumers \(jobs or\npools in\nthe Schedulable class to compute the fractional share received\nby each pool or job. The core of the implementation is a\nnew comparator, named FractionalFairShareComparator, in\nSchedulingAlgorithms that implements the proposed sorting\ncriteria in Algorithm 2. Our implementation packages OFS\nas a new scheduling mode of HFS, so that a user can switch\nbetween HFS and OFS at any time by modifying the allocation\nfile of HFS fair-scheduler.xml 1 master and 10 slaves VM disk. All nodes are considered rack-local by Hadoop5. To\nallow controllable experiment, we emulate frontend activities\nby synthetically generating availability states using a back-\nground process running at each slave node \(the master node is\nalways available Monitor, which then triggers task sus-\npension/resumption and updates of node availability statistics.\nWe model the dynamic availability of each node by an i.i.d.\nBernoulli process, parameterized by the available probability\npi for node i \(i = 1, . . . , 10 i.e.,\ntime between state updates We configure Availability State\nMonitor to check state every 3 seconds to align with Hadoop’s\nheartbeat interval. Note that the generation and the checking\nof availability states are asynchronous and possibly at different\nfrequencies. Our default setting is to set ? = 10 seconds, and\npi = 0.5 for half of the nodes and pi 0.9 for the rest. Our\nselection of such bipolar node availability is based on our pre-\nvious study of an enterprise data center [10], which shows that\nmost nodes are either heavily loaded or lightly loaded. We also\nvary this setting to test the impact of node availability patterns.\nWe use several benchmarks to represent typical job cate-\ngories. Based on the nature of workload, we divide MapRe-\nduce jobs into three categories: \(a b c use the benchmark randomwriter to represent \(a b c fairness\nissues only arise when there are multiple jobs, we construct\nbatched workloads where each batch consists of m identical\njobs submitted simultaneously. The variation of job completion\ntimes within the same batch, measured by standard deviation\nand dispersion index6, thus measures the level of fairness of\n5Hadoop considers all VMs to reside on the same virtual rack, although\ntheir actual placements are hidden from us by virtualization.\n6Dispersion index, defined as variance divided by square of mean, is a\nnormalized measure of variation.\nthe scheduler \(the smaller, the fairer over 10 batches.\nTo separately evaluate the impact of fractional task slot and\nmap-reduce correlation, we first disable Correlation Schedul-\ning \(‘CS OFS impact of correlation scheduling will be evaluated\nlater in Section VI-D \(‘OFS+CS under Opportunistic Fair Scheduling\nWe first take a look at the detailed resource allocation under\nHFS and OFS during a single batch of jobs. As shown in\nFig. 3, when running a batch of randomwriter jobs in parallel,\nHFS 


only tries to balance the number of running tasks per job,\nas shown in the upper subplot, while OFS tries to balance the\neffective share per job by taking into account the availability of\neach map host. Therefore, OFS achieves a more even resource\nallocation across jobs. Similar observations are also made for\nsort and wordcount.\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n0\n5\n10\n15\ntime \(sec sl\nots\n 3\njob 4\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\ntime \(sec s\nlot\ns 1\njob 2\njob 3\njob 4\n\(a sec sl\nots\n 1\njob 2\njob 3\njob 4\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\ntime \(sec s\nlot\ns b a b ran-\ndomwriter jobs with 20 maps, pi = 0.1, 0.19, . . . , 0.91 for i = 1, . . . , 10,\n? = 3 seconds Impact of Job Type and Configuration\nThe first question we ask is: what kind of job and what kind\nof job configuration are more amendable to opportunistic fair\nscheduling? To answer this question, we conduct experiments\nusing randomwriter, sort, and wordcount, each under two dif-\nferent configurations. Specifically randomwriter has no input\nand no reduce task, and its only configurable parameter is the\namount of output to generate, which determines the number\nof map tasks \(each map generates up to 1 GB include the amount of input data, which determines\nthe number of map tasks \(each map sorts up to 64 MB the number of reduce tasks. For wordcount, the original\nimplementation in Hadoop only allows the configuration of\ninput, which again determines the number of map tasks similar\nto sort, but we rewrite it to allow us to configure the number\nof reduce tasks. In all our experiments, the schedulers have\nsimilar average job completion times, and therefore we only\nshow the results for standard deviation and dispersion index\ndue to limited space. From the results in Fig. 4, we observe\nthe following. First, our scheduler can significantly improve\nthe fairness of HFS by reducing the standard deviation of job\ncompletion times by up to 40% and the dispersion index by\nup to 50%. Moreover, among the benchmarks, we see that\nrandomwriter achieves the most improvement while word-\ncount achieves the least. This is partly because our definition\n14\nof fractional share implicitly assumes that tasks last much\nlonger than the interval between availability changes, such\nthat the average node availability during a task lifetime can\nbe approximated by its long-term average. This calculation\nincurs larger error for short tasks such as the map tasks in\nsort, which affects scheduling performance. Another factor\nis the level of parallelism. Randomwriter has the highest\nlevel of parallelism as all its tasks are completely parallel;\nin contrast, sort and wordcount contain a shuffle/reduce phase\nthat enforces a partial ordering among tasks. Job configuration\nalso significantly affects the level of parallelism, where a\nlarger number of map/reduce tasks implies higher parallelism\nand a smaller number implies lower parallelism. Intuitively,\nparallelism is the degree of freedom for the scheduler to\nbalance resource allocation among jobs, and thus jobs with a\nhigher degree of freedom are more amendable to opportunistic\nfair scheduling. These hypotheses are well supported by our\nexperiment results.\nrandomwriter sort wordcount\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nst\nd \n\(se\nc a deviation\nrandomwriter sort wordcount\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n0.02\n0.025\n0.03\n0.035\n0.04\n0.045\n0.05\ndi\nsp\ner\nsio\nn\n?56.6997%\n?35.9867%\n?30.5197 nHFS\nOFS\n\(b 10 maps for randomwriter, 16 maps and 10\nreduces for sort, 10 maps and 5 reduces for wordcount; p1 = . . . = p5 =\n0.5, p6 = . . . = p10 = 0.9, ? = 10 seconds Numbers in figures denote\nthe change relative to HFS.\nFor jobs without sufficient degree of freedom, e.g jobs\nwith only a couple of tasks, it is difficult for any scheduler to\nachieve truly fair scheduling in a heterogeneous environment,\nsince task is the minimum schedulable workload. In particular,\nthis implies jobs with a single reduce task is unlikely to benefit\nfrom opportunistic fair scheduling. To verify this conjecture,\nwe conduct another set of experiments with a lower level of\nparallelism for each benchmark; see Fig. 5. The results confirm\nthat the relative fairness of our scheduler degrades when the\nlevel of parallelism decreases. Note that this is an inherent\nproperty of such jobs instead of a deficiency in scheduler\ndesign.\nrandomwriter sort wordcount\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nst\nd n\(se\nc a wordcount\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\ndi\nsp\ner\nsio\nn\n?28.0304%\n?0.052796%\n?36.1895%\nHFS\nOFS\n\(b index\nFig. 5.

RELATED WORK\nThere have been several studies of MapReduce perfor-\nmance in opportunistic environment, especially in volunteer\ncomputing systems [4], [5], [11], [12]. In order to deliver\nreliable MapReduce service in a highly dynamic environ-\nment, MOON [4], [5] proposes to augment the opportunistic\nMapReduce cluster with a small number of dedicated nodes,\nwhere an adaptive algorithm is proposed for data placement\nand speculative task scheduling under such augmentation.\nAnother thread of research tries to improve performance on\nopportunistic resources by predicting the availability of these\nresources. ADAPT [12] uses the availability history to assign\nan expected availability rate to each new participant of the\nvolunteer computing system. Similar techniques are adopted\nin [11] to select a subset of most available nodes in volunteer\ncomputing systems. All of these works focus on improving\nthe performance of a single job; in contrast, our work focuses\non the fairness among multiple jobs in a shared environment.\nAnother related topic is the scheduling of MapReduce jobs\nin a dedicated environment. In addition to the FIFO, the\nCapacity, and the Fair schedulers in Hadoop release, more\nsophisticated schedulers have been proposed to satisfy various\nperformance requirements, such as LATE [8], Delay [13], DP\n[14], and Corona [15 LATE [8] proposes a more accurate pre-\ndiction of job progress in a \(physically is used together with the analysis of overhead to im-\nprove the scheduling of speculative tasks. A refined version of\nLATE in [13] incorporates delay scheduling and copy-compute\nsplitting to improve data locality and avoid performance issues\nintroduced by LATE. Dynamic Proportional Share Scheduler\n[14] takes into consideration the economic aspect of resource\nallocation by letting users bid for their resources. To 


handle\nthe drastic growth of data in Facebook, Corona [15] introduces\na cluster manager on top of JobTrackers to improve the\nscalability of MapReduce clusters by separating the duties of\nresource management and execution management.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we investigate MapReduce scheduling in\nan opportunistic environment with focus on the fairness\nbetween multiple jobs. We identify several deficiencies of\nthe current fair scheduler, based on which we propose a new\nscheduler that uses the notions of fractional share and map-\nreduce correlation to incorporate dynamic node availability\ninto scheduling decisions. Our implementation in Hadoop\nverifies that the proposed scheduler can improve fairness by\nsignificantly reducing the variability in job completion times,\nachieving up to 50% better fairness in our experiments.\nREFERENCES\n[1] “Amazon EC2 Spot Instances,” aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/.\n[2] J.

introduced SALSA, an approach to automatically\nanalyze Hadoop logs to construct state-machine views of the\nplatform’s execution [25]. The derived state-machines are used\nto trace the data-flow and control-flow executions. SALSA\ncomputes the histograms of the durations of each state and uses\nthese histograms to estimate the Probability Density Functions\n\(PDFs between the PDFs across machines to detect\nanomalies. Tan et al. also compare the duration of a state\nin a particular node with its past PDF to determine if the\nduration exceeds a determined threshold and can be flagged\nas an anomaly.\nAnother related work to this paper is the approach of Xu\net al. in [26], which uses the source code to understand the\nstructure of the logs. They create features based on the constant\nand variable parts of the log messages and apply the Principal\nComponent Analysis \(PCA behaviour.\nAll the above approaches are all designed for system\nadministrators in managing their large clusters. Our approach,\non the other hand, aims to assist developers in comparing the\ndeployed system on such large clusters against the develop-\nment cloud.\nX. CONCLUSION\nDevelopers of BDA Apps typically first develop their appli-\ncation with a small sample of data in a pseudo cloud, then\ndeploy the application in a large scale cloud environment.\nHowever, the larger data and more complex environments\nlead to unexpected executions of the underlying platform.\nSuch unexpected executions and their context cannot be easily\nuncovered by traditional approaches.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach to uncover the\ndifferent behaviour of the underlying platforms for BDA Apps\nbetween runs with small testing data and large real-life data\nin a cloud environment. To evaluate our approach, we perform\na case study on Hadoop, a widely used platform, with three\nBDA Apps. The case study results show the strength of our\napproach in two aspects:\n1 drastically reduces the verification effort\nby 86-97% when verifying the deployment of BDA\nApps in the cloud.\n2 the prob-\nlematic logs reported by our approach are much fewer\nthan using keyword search, which makes it possible to\nmanually explore the problematic logs.\nIn addition, our approach provides additional context informa-\ntion \(execution sequences sequences of the logs to\nrapidly understand the cause of problematic log lines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

The retroreflector does not require any thermal control resources. Telecom between the Earth and the hub or from the remote units to the hub would be during the lunar day only  Description of the Design  A thermal blanket \(MLI Silver-Teflon would be used to moderate the temperature variation of the surface. The MLI and the lunar material thermal conduction properties could be used to insulate the different ALGEP elements from the external environment  The Mars Exploration Rover thermal switch and a thermal radiator with thermal louvers would be used to reject the internally generated thermal energy. The MER Thermal Switch has the ability to transfer up to 11 W. For the hub three or four switches may be necessary, depending on the RF power output  Potentially a small electric heater/thermostat system may be needed \(on the order of 10% of the dissipated electrical energy example, the seismometer, which dissipates 1.5 W, may need a 0.15 W heater. A detailed thermal analysis would be necessary to further assess this need  The ALGEP hardware location would be dictated by the science requirements. Each ALGEP element could be either positioned on the surface or buried.  An example of a buried element would be the seismometer, while the hub could be surface mounted. In either case a surface blanket would be required. The surface blanket would minimize the lunar temperature variation, from a range of -173 to ~127  C to a range under the blanked between approximately -73 to 27  C. Initial calculations indicate that the blanket extending about 0.5 m beyond the edge of the instrument or hub would provide the temperature control of the lunar surface required to minimize the temperature variation. For the lunar night, a small electric heater may be needed to keep the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits  For polar region operation it is assumed that the ALGEP could operate at all times as the solar arrays would always have incident solar energy and could provide electrical power for operations.  Thus with electrical power for the instruments and hub, the thermal radiator and louvers could maintain the ALGEP hardware within specified temperature limits. Initial calculations indicate that the current conceptual thermal control design does not require electric heaters for this location  Design Rationale  The design uses MLI, thermal conduction control, electric heaters, thermal radiators thermal louvers, and a deployed surface blanket to provide thermal control to maintain the remote units and hub within specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would 


specified temperature limits. The surface blanket would minimize the temperature variation of the surface, and electric heaters would provide makeup thermal energy  Risk  The thermal subsystem design is a low to moderate risk element, as the hardware used has extensive flight experience. Although this system would be on the surface of the Moon, the environment would be space-like, with the  Figure 6  ALGEP avionics block diagram showing the power and command and data handing  interface. This is a low-power design to enable data collection during lunar night at the remote units. The hub  contains the same avionics package but does not interface with an instrument  13 exception of the infrared heating of the lunar surface therefore the space qualified thermal control hardware could provide thermal control for this mission  Command and Data Handling Subsystem Design Requirements  The ALGEP controller is designed to meet the six year mission lifetime requirement stemming from the science objectives flowing down to the mission requirements and has a technology cutoff of 2016 \(assumes a 2020 launch interface to the science instrument and the UHF radio.  The controller for the hub interfaces to the UHF and S-band radios. Each type of controller would be single string  Design Assumptions  All selected electronic parts for the controller have a path to flight hardware with a technology cutoff of 2016. There would be one ALGEP hub that has a bi-directional S-band link to Earth and a UHF receiver link to the remote instrument units. There would be four ALGEP remote units that have UHF transmitters to link to the ALGEP hub. The controllers would have an operating temperature range: -20  C to 35  C. The total ionizing dose of radiation would be 2 krads for the mission  Description of the Design  Both controller designs would incorporate low-powered Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs devices and I/O drivers.  Portions of the existing MultiMission System Architecture Platform \(MSAP Engineering Unit \(REU IP provide the mission clock and alarm clock logic.  Both the hub and remote unit controllers would capture engineering data regarding temperatures, currents and voltages. Figure 6 provides an overview of the command and data handling and power subsystem architectures.  The remote units would be supplied with 2 Gb of memory and the hub would have 5 Gb of memory  Design Rationale  A low-powered avionics architecture would be achieved by developing a stand-alone controller capable of operating at various power levels. In the lowest power configuration only the mission clock and alarm clock logic would be active. Other logic, analog and I/O functions would be power strobed in the off mode during this very low-power mode. Science and engineering data would be stored in non-volatile memory elements that retain their data in the power-off mode  Risk  The controller requires engineering development to obtain the low-powered mode required for night operation However, it has been designed to incorporate components with flight heritage. A lower frequency oscillator would be used to reduce power  Telecom Subsystem 


Design Requirements  The telecom subsystem is designed to return 3.4 Gb of stored data every 16 days during lunar night in addition to 1.2 Gb of additional data collected each 24 hour period during daylight. This translates into a minimum direct-to-Earth return data rate of ~50 kbps for an 8 hour pass each Earth day for 16 days of sunlight. The subsystem must operate down to a temperature of -20  C and survive non-operational temperature of -50  C. The telecom subsystem would support two-way communications between the hub and the DSN network. It would also support two-way communications between the hub and each of the remote instrument packages on the surface. There would be a minimum 3 dB margin for the direct-to-Earth DTE  Design Assumptions  The telecom subsystem is assumed to be a single string design. The hub would have an S-band radio and antenna for two-way communications with a DSN 34 m ground station. The nominal downlink rate would be 120 kbps and the uplink rate would be 2 kbps. The surface links would be at UHF. The forward link data rate would be 8 kbps and the return rate would be 256 kbps. The maximum range for the surface links would be 100 m. All of the surface links would have line-of-sight between the units. It is assumed that the astronauts would point the Sband antenna towards Earth, within 5  of the center of Earth. This should be relatively easy to do as 5  is a very loose pointing requirement and the uplink/downlink would be marginally affected if the pointing is off by a little more than 5  A signal could be added which would use an uplink from the Earth to give a relative signal power to ensure the pointing requirement is met  Description of the Design  The telecom subsystem would use a commercial off-the-shelf S-band transponder \(L3 CXS-610 has a 5 W power amplifier and an S-band diplexer included This radio is used on GRAIL and a similar unit was used on Genesis. The diplexer would be connected to an S-band low gain antenna \(LGA be a 2-element S-band patch array with a boresight gain of 9 dB. It would be mounted on the end of one solar array on the hub and gimbaled to allow the astronaut to point it to the Earth  The hub communicates with each of the remote instrument units in UHF using a new UHF micro-transceiver. Each UHF microtransceiver would have a radio frequency output power of 50 mW. The UHF transceiver would use a halfduplex system meaning it would transmit and then listen However, it cannot do both at the same time. The UHF links would use a simple UHF monopole antenna, similar to the antennas flown on MER, and mounted on the top of the hub and remote units. The hub could only communicate with one remote unit at a time. Figure 7 shows the hub and remote unit telecom block diagrams  The S-Band telemetry link has a margin of 7.0 dB for a telemetry rate of 120 kbps into a 34 m beam waveguide ground station. The data rate could be increased to reduce 14 playback time. The surface link would have a margin exceeding 20 dB for a return data rate of 256 kbps. This includes a multipath loss allotment of 20 dB. The margin would be large because the range would be so small and all of the links would be line of sight  Design Rationale  Where available, the design of this subsystem uses heritage hardware. The UHF microtransceiver is a radio that is under development for the Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, low 


Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
