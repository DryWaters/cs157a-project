The nature of the problems associated with \nvehicular traffic is not uniform across the globe. In the recent \npast, several solutions were proposed to improve traffic \nmanagement. However most of these solutions cater to the \ntraffic scenarios in the developed countries where traffic is lane \nbased and the issues being encountered is quite different from \nthat of developing countries. The existing solutions cannot be \nreadily applied to the traffic situation of developing countries. \nIn this paper, we propose an architecture which addresses the \nchallenges of real time traffic management of non-lane based \nand chaotic traffic of developing countries. The big data \ncollected for traffic analysis can be used to provide predictive \nanalysis and patterns to enable the Traffic Department to \nmanage the traffic better.\nKeywords-Crowdsourcing, Intelligent Traffic systems, Big \ndata, Smartphone\nI. INTRODUCTION \nIn the developing countries such as India, over the last \nseveral decades, there has been a consistent migration of \nworkforce to metropolitan cities due to rapid nindustrialization [1]. The motor vehicles are affordable due \nto the rise in the per capita income [2]. The growth of road \nnetwork has not kept pace with the growth in the number of \nmotor vehicles. The vehicle population is growing at a \ncompound annual growth rate \(CAGR percent in the total road \nlength [3][4]. Infrastructure projects are slow and expensive. \nIn some situations the geography of a place may not support \nany further infrastructure improvements. The average annual \ngrowth rate of vehicular traffic in metropolitan cities like \nBangalore is around 7-10% [5]. Traffic congestion is one of \nthe crucial problems faced by the people in metropolitan \ncities. This leads to increase in the average commute time \nand wastes time. It is highly important to provide guidance \nto the commuter on which traffic routes to take and which to \navoid. Traffic congestion causes extra load to the Traffic \nDepartment whose primary goal is to ensure smooth flow of \ntraffic. In a country such as India, Traffic control in the road \nintersections often requires manual intervention by Traffic \nPolice personnel due to the following reasons:\n Many intersections are not supported by traffic \nsignals and hence require manual traffic control.\n Those intersections that are equipped with traffic \nsignal systems operate based on fixed timer nintervals and hence do not shadow the traffic \npattern.\nThe following are the challenges faced by Traffic Police \nDepartment:\n The traffic situation is dynamic: The traffic \ncongestion could be due to various reasons like a \nprocession on the road, an accident, roads get \ncongested because of a person of importance passing \nby or part of the roads are under repair. All these, \nlead to chaotic behavior. Fig 1 illustrates a typical \ntraffic situation during peak hours.\n Resources are limited and not elastic: Our \ndiscussions with Bangalore Traffic Police \nDepartment indicate that the allocation of the \nresources\(personnel static. The dynamic \nbehavior of traffic and resource allocation does not \ngo hand in hand. The temporary traffic hotspots are \nidentified by continual observation or upon \ninformation received from public. This increases the \ncycle time to respond to sudden traffic changes.\nFigure 1. Bangalore City Traffic\nIn order to ensure smooth flow of traffic, the Traffic \nDepartment has implemented several measures like creating nawareness among the public on following lane discipline \nthrough advertisements, advance notifications to public on \n2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data\n978-0-7695-5006-0/13 $26.00 © 2013 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.43\n271\npossible traffic congestion or road blocks in newspapers/ \nradios social media. These approaches are not optimal to \nsolve the traffic problem.\nCurrently the commuter guidance is provided by:\n GPS: Navigation systems aid the traveler by \nproviding alternate paths to the destination and also \nshortest path to the destination. Navigation systems \nbased on GPS have seen great development in nrecent years. GPS devices have become an integral \npart in our daily lives with the use of GPS receivers \nin the mobile devices especially the smartphones.\n Smartphone applications: The apps provide \nshortest path to a given destination [6][7]. \nAlthough, these apps provide shortest path to \nensure the user reaches the place fast, they fail to \nindicate the traffic situation along the path. Hence \nthe apps fail to make an impact on the user.\n Active Crowdsourcing: The commuters provide \nthe traffic update to the Traffic Police Department nthrough SMS or updates in the social networking \nsites like Facebook, Twitter. The Traffic Police \nDepartment uses this information to inform the \npublic.  \nThe resource allocation problem in the Traffic Police nDepartment is currently addressed by:\n Information from the Public: The Department \nassigns Traffic Police personnel to road \nintersections based on static data or based on the \ninformation received from commuters.\n Observation of road intersections: The \nintersections are monitored over a period of time to \nunderstand the traffic behavior. The assignment of \ntraffic personnel is based on this observation.\nThere is a need for a 


optimal solution that can effectively \nguide the commuter on the commute path as well as support \nthe traffic department to ensure smooth traffic flow in real \ntime. Our work is intended to address these dual goals. Our nwork aims to provide optimal traffic control under the \nconstraints of limited resources and a chaotic traffic \nbehavior. In our work, we use smartphones as sensors to \nprovide location information of all the commuters. The \nlocation information is analyzed in real time to detect the \ntraffic density. This model addresses the dual goals.\nThe smartphone adoption has increased rapidly across \nthe world as the mobile technology has transformed our \nlives. Mobile phones are equipped with lot of sensors which \nare engaged in data accumulation. The ubiquity of the \nmobile phones and the amount of data generated by the \nmobile phones because of the sensors have resulted in a new \narea of research which deals with categorization of the nvarious data and deriving new applications out of it. One \nsuch application can be getting alerts about the traffic \ncondition in the city.\nAlso, the widespread use of smartphones has resulted in \napplications which involve collective participation of the \nusers. We are witnessing an inversion of the traditional way \nby which content has been generated and consumed over the \ncenturies. From news and encyclopedic knowledge, the ntraditional old pattern has been one in which the production \nof content on web was the right of few people and \norganizations only and most other people would be \nconsumer of this information. With the advent of the web \nand the ease with which one can migrate content to it, that \npattern has reversed, leading to a situation whereby millions \ncreate content in the form of blogs, news, videos, music, and \nso on, and relatively few can attend to it all. This \nphenomenon is called Democratization of the web.\nCrowdsourcing [13] is a related field that aims to cultivate \nand coordinate the collective efforts and wisdom of large \ngroup of people Crowdsourcing is partly motivated by the \nassumption that, under the right conditions, a diverse group \nof individuals can wield a collective intelligence that is \ngreater than the intelligence of any one of its individual \nconstituents [13]. Crowdsourcing is a technique wherein a\ntask is outsourced to a distributed group of people\n\(crowd are broadcast to \nunknown group of people asking for solutions. Users \n\(crowd solutions are consolidated \nby the “crowdsourcer”. The crowd may be rewarded \nmonetarily, with prizes, with extra talk time or some other \nform of recognition. In some cases, the reward could be just \nintellectual satisfaction.\nThere are two variations to the involvement of crowd in \nthe crowdsourcing technique: \n Active Crowdsourcing \n Passive Crowdsourcing.\nActive Crowdsourcing is a technique where individuals \nhave to actively participate or engage themselves in the task \nat hand. Generally only a small percent of the population get \nmotivated to participate in the activity. Thus motivation is \nprovided in terms of providing monetary benefits or rewards \nin other forms. The major parts of the population are not \ninterested in this involvement so the decision is made only \nby a minority group of the crowd. Passive Crowdsourcing is \na technique where the information is gleaned from the entire \ncrowd, with the crowd not doing anything apart from their \nregular tasks. It does not involve the active participation of \nthe crowd, unlike active crowdsourcing. \nIn the Indian metros, mobile phones are more common \nthan vehicles fitted with GPS systems. In the recent days, \nusage of mobile phones has become vital in the day-to-day \nactivities of the people. Also the number of people using \nthe smartphones in India is increasing [8]. The feature\nphones are likely to give way to smartphones in the near \nfuture [9]. Based on these data, we can make a premise that \nevery individual will own a smartphone in the near future. \nMost smartphones have inbuilt GPS and hence can be used \nto provide traffic data. Also, smartphones can provide audio \noutput to the driving commuter providing a eyes-free ninteraction.\n272\nIn this paper, Section II discusses on the related work, \nsection III discusses on the proposed solution, section IV \ndiscusses the implementation and section V discusses the \nease of use.\nII RELATED WORK\nMany people have proposed and implemented several \nmethodologies to find the real time traffic information. Few \nof them are discussed below in brief.\nA. Updates on social networking sites\nLive traffic information can be published on the social \nmedia. Updating the social media like Facebook nTwitter[10][11][12][19] involves the engagement of the \nuser. The commuters update the traffic status on the social \nmedia. The traffic status is published to the people who are \nregistered to the facebook / twitter account. The information \ngets published irrespective of whether the person is using \nthe congested route or not. This information can also be \nused by the Traffic department to provide better services to \nother commuters who intend to take this route. This is based \non active crowdsourcing wherein the commuters themselves \nhave to update the traffic situation. This approach is an\noverhead on the commuters. This approach is completely \ndependent on the input of the commuter. The commuter \nmay not be interested in providing the information.  There is \nno way to validate the information provided on the social \nnetworking site by a user Therefore the correctness of the \nreal time traffic situation is not guaranteed and hence is not 


nefficient.\nB. Use of cameras at prime traffic junctions\nThe junctions with heavy traffic density are identified by \npast data or observation over a period of time. The cameras \nare placed in these junctions roads [12]. The cameras \nprovide real time traffic images. The images are streamed to \nthe Traffic Management Centre \(TMC nFigure 2. Online Traffic Management Centre in Bangalore, India\nThis approach has the following limitations First of all, the \ncameras are placed only in certain junctions. This does not \nguarantee the absence of traffic in other places. The Traffic \nPolice Department defines a major junction as one where 3 \nor 4 roads meet with heavy flow of traffic throughout the \nday. The cameras are installed in these major junctions only nThere are 350 major junctions \(with traffic signals junctions \nwhich are not even half of the total number of major \njunctions. However, there are more than 500 junctions \nwhich are not classified as major and do not have cameras. \nThese junctions generally get congested during the peak \nhours. Secondly, cameras involve investment and \nmaintenance. The cost of this project increases as the \nnumber of cameras increase. Thirdly, performance of the \ncameras is affected by the bad weather conditions. Fourth, \nthe cameras can cover a radius of 0.5km only and beyond \nthat, the traffic information is not relayed. Fifth, the images \nin the server have to be analyzed and interpreted by traffic npersonnel to give the traffic update. Fig 2 shows the officials \nat TMC analyzing the traffic. Each person working at TMC\ncan analyze the traffic situation streamed from 10 to 15 \ncameras. This means to analyze 176 cameras 15 to 20 \npeople are required to constantly monitor the traffic and \nupdate the Traffic police or radio broadcaster. The updated \ninformation will be announced on the radios as real time \nupdates. The videos can be directly streamed to smartphones\nin which case the user has to interpret traffic situation This\nconsumes heavy bandwidth.  \nC. Use of on-road sensors \nTraditional on-road sensors \(e.g. inductive loops are \nused for collecting data[12]. But these are not sufficient \nbecause of their limited coverage and expensive costs of \nimplementation. A large number of sensors are required to \nmonitor the traffic in a large area. The on-road sensors can \nbe affected by bad weather condition and will be not \nfunctional. Also, the maintenance cost is high.\nD. Using GPS data \nGPS is becoming more accessible and affordable in the \nrecent days, however, so far only a limited number of cars \nare equipped with this system, typically fleet management nservices \(e.g. taxi drivers GPS probe data [12] \nare widely used as a source of real-time information by \nmany service providers but it suffers from a limited number \nof vehicles equipped with the device and high equipment \ncosts.\nE. Combination of above techniques \nIn this approach, several data collection techniques are used \nto collect real time traffic data. A combination of techniques \nlike on-road sensors, cameras, updates on social media can \nbe combined to provide the traffic information [12]. This \napproach requires complex algorithms to analyze the input \nfrom various sources. The combined analysis fails to \n273\nprovide traffic update on time. Also, often the data from \ndifferent sources can be contradictory because of the \ndrawbacks /limitations in the sources themselves. In such a \nsituation, the analysis becomes even more challenging.\nF. Smartphone apps\nIn the recent past, various traffic apps have been \ndeveloped on Android and iOS platforms [12][14] like \nWaze, Traffic genie, Google Traffic, which claim to provide \nreal time traffic updates to the users.  These traffic apps nrequire the users on road to update / validate the traffic \nsituation in which they are. This update is recorded in the \nserver to serve other users of the app.  Hence the latest \ntraffic update is based on the user updating their maps and \nfor users who have paid for the service.  The traffic data is \ncollected only from the users of these apps which clearly \nreflect that the data is not valid.\nIII. ARCHITECTURE\nThe work aims to develop a solution to guide the \ncommuters about the traffic en route and enable the Traffic \npolice department to optimally allocate the resources. The \nwork uses the GPS information from the people’s nsmartphone to calculate the traffic density and indicates the \ntraffic status along the path on their smartphone. \nThe objectives of this paper are:\n Develop a Traffic Information System which uses \npassive crowdsourcing technique for data \ncollection.\n Develop a system to adapt to the rapidly changing \ntraffic situation.\n Develop a system which is capable of processing \nBig Data.\n Develop a system which achieves minimal \nresponse time, high availability and reliability.\nFig 3 shows the architecture of CroTIS. The architecture \nof CroTIS involves two parties – mobile user and CroTIS \nserver. The functionalities of the various components are \nas described below:\nA. Mobile Clients: \n Mobile clients can be smartphones or tablets.\n Mobile clients are registered with the Traffic server.\n An application on the mobile device enables the \ndevice to connect to the Traffic server and get real \ntime traffic updates.\n Mobile clients act like sensors and sends location\ninformation to the Traffic server without user \nintervention. Thus user data is collected through \npassive crowdsourcing. The mobile device updates \nthe server whenever a change in its 


location is \ndetected.\n In the scenario of a developing country, the number \nof mobile devices generating location information is \nhuge and the rate at which the devices generate the \ndata is enormous. Hence this data can be categorized \ninto Big Data.\nFigure 3. CroTIS Architecture\nB. CroTIS Server\nThe CroTIS server provides real time traffic updates to \nthe connected mobile clients, constantly. The Server always \nmaintains the current location of the commuter and any \nchange in the traffic status along the commuter’s path is nupdated immediately. The functionalities of the various \ncomponents within the server are as listed below:\n1 Navigation Service Provider\(NSP provide services.\na latitude and \nlongitude mobile clients and stores it in \nthe database which is in ‘Crowd Data Source’.\n Subscriber receives the Traffic service request from \nthe mobile client and stores in the database. \nb receives the traffic update from  Traffic \nInformation Controller\(TIC the list of mobile \nclients who have requested for the Traffic service \nand provides the clients with traffic updates.\n2 NC component queries the \nCrowd Data Source \(CDS junctions.\n NC, then requests the Location Manager to provide \na list of paths between a given source and ndestination.\n NC evaluates the path with the least traffic density\n NC then, returns the result to NSP.\n274\n3 assigned with a Location \nIdentifier\(LocID destination.\n4 mobile clients. The functions of \nCrowd Data Source include GPS data collection, data \nanalysis to filter the data noise and data processing to \ncompute traffic density at each junction.\na Crowd Data Collector collects the crowd \nsourced data \(mobile ID, GPS co-ordinates, time Service Provider.\n The data in the database consists of GPS co-\nordinates from all mobile devices irrespective of \nwhether a mobile-client is involved in traffic \nsituation. Thereby, the GPS information is received \nfrom people traveling on the road, people standing \nby road side and also from pedestrians.\n Using the GPS coordinates, we calculate other \nparameters like distance traversed in a given time, \nspeed of the mobile client and direction. This \ninformation is also stored in the database.\nb Crowd Data Analyzer groups the mobile \nclients into segments, based on their locations.\n The data within each segment is carefully analyzed \nto remove the data of those clients who are not \ninvolved in the traffic. \nc Crowd data processor:\n Performs parallel computation to calculate the \ntraffic density using the algorithm illustrated in Fig \n4.\nThe proposed system achieves the objectives of the \nsystem in three steps:\ni Data Collection\nii device sends its GPS coordinates to the \nserver. The server stores the GPS information along with the \nIMEI number of the device and the date/time at which the \nGPS information was received, in the database. But what is \nthe frequency in which the mobile devices send the GPS \ninformation? If the data is collected every second from the \ndevice, it results in a huge amount of continual data flow \ninto the database. However, most of the data generated may \nnot have any value. Also, continuous flow of GPS \ninformation from mobile device will drain the mobile’s                      \nbattery, which is not desirable.  So, we thought of sending \nGPS updates to the server periodically. Periodic updates \ncould also be inefficient, if there is no change in the data. \nSo, it is more optimal for a device to send the GPS \ncoordinates only when there is a change in location. This \ntechnique of data collection also results in a huge amount of \ndata. This data has the characteristics of Big Data namely \nVolume, Variety and Velocity. Also, there is a need to \nquickly process the data that is getting generated \ncontinuously. \nii database is filtered to \nremove data noise. The data noise refers to the GPS \ncoordinates received from devices which are not part of the \ntraffic. The following procedure is used to remove noise:\n Mark segments around a given location L\n Calculate the displacement of the devices within the \nsegment. \nIf the average displacement within the segment is greater\nthan the threshold value, then the devices whose \ndisplacement is less than the threshold values are discarded \nas noise. \nIf the average displacement within the segment is lesser \nthan the threshold value, then none of the GPS coordinates \nin the segment are discarded. \niii Traffic Data Processor:\nThis is the heart of CroTIS. The traffic density is \ncomputed in this step. We have devised an algorithm to \ncompute the traffic density from the data obtained in the \nsecond step \(Traffic Data Analysis follows: \n1. The traffic density need not be calculated on every \npoint on the road. Such a computation would lead \nto redundant information and will also result in the \nwastage of computational resources. Hence sample 


npoints along a path are selected. The sample points \nare generally selected at junctions or at intervals of na fixed distance.\n2. Mark a segment around the selected location.

Compute the distance travelled by the devices and \nbearing \(direction Haversine formula \n[21][22].\n5. Calculate the maximum displacement among the \ndevices.\n6. 6, 7:   Applying Pareto principle [20], we calculate \nthe number of devices \(N80 displacement in the sample.  \n275\nIf 80% of the devices in the sample have at least \n80% of the maximum displacement, then the traffic \nstatus can be assumed to be GREEN.\nFigure 4. Traffic density finder Algorithm\nThe challenge for the Traffic server is to provide the \ntraffic status at all locations, in real time. In a sequential \ncomputational model, the problem can be visualized as a list \nof location entities for which the server computes the traffic \ndensity in a linear fashion. The time taken for computation \nis proportional to the number of locations. The nature of the \ndata which we are looking into is huge for any city and \nhence traffic density computation will take a lot of time. The \nobjective of deriving the real time traffic information cannot \nbe met, with sequential computational model. Hence, in our \nwork, we have used a distributed computational model to \nhandle the Big Data. This is illustrated in the \nImplementation section.\nIV IMPLEMENTATION\nThe proposed system requires implementation on the \nclient side and also server side. We have used the open \nsource technologies like Google Maps, Android and Hadoop \nfor our implementation On the client side, we have \ndeveloped an Android app, which enables the user to get \ntraffic updates along the desired route. The mobile app can \nbe implemented for all device platforms. We have used \nPython and Hadoop framework on the server side. The \nchoice of our frameworks is significantly of their open \nsource nature. To model the scenario of millions of \nsmartphones generating GPS information, we have \ndeveloped a simulator to generate the GPS information, \nconstantly.\nHadoop is a software framework for distributed nprocessing of huge data sets across clusters of computers \nusing simple programming models [15][18]. Our work nrelies on Hadoop library for high reliability and availability \nas the library itself detects and handles failures. Hence we \nneed not depend on external hardware for achieving \navailability. Hadoop implements a computational paradigm \nnamed MapReduce, a simple programming model to process \nhuge data sets in parallel. In this paradigm, the application is\ndivided into many small fragments, each of which can be \nexecuted on any node in the cluster. In addition, it provides \na distributed file system that stores data on the compute nnodes, providing very high aggregate bandwidth across the \ncluster. Both map/reduce and the distributed file systems are\ndesigned so that node failures are automatically handled by \nthe framework. An overview of MapReduce is as shown in \nFig 5 [16][17].\nIn our work, the Map function, assigns a LocID to every \nGPS coordinate, in the database. In the Reduce phase, the \nGPS coordinates with the same LocID are grouped to form nsegments. The devices within a segment are considered for \ncomputing the traffic density, using the algorithm illustrated \nin Fig 4.\nFigure 5. MapReduce overview\nA commuter can avail the Traffic service by enabling the napp. Once the app is enabled, the commuter tells the server \nabout his destination. The server provides the commute path \nwith the least traffic. The traffic server continues to update \nthe commuter with the latest traffic status en route, till the \ndestination is reached.\nAn Interface is developed for the Traffic Police nDepartment to enable the traffic controller to query for the \ntraffic situation in any place at any time. The humongous \namount of traffic data stored in the database was used to \ngenerate graphs depicting the traffic situations in a given \nlocation.  This will help the Traffic Department to assess\n276\nand react to the traffic anywhere at real time. This would \nenable the Traffic Department to optimally utilize the \nexisting man power.\nV EASE OF USE\nThe proposed system does not require the client to use \nany special device/hardware in their vehicles and no specific \ninfrastructure is to be built along the road. It is therefore less \nexpensive than conventional detectors/sensors and offers \nlarger coverage capabilities. The servers are equipped with nhuge data processing and parallel data computing \ncapabilities. The proposed system generates the traffic data \ncontinuously instead of an isolated point data. It is faster to \nset up, easier to install, and needs less maintenance.\nVI. SECURITY\nThe security issues in the proposed model can be broadly \nclassified into two categories:\n Privacy: The privacy issues can be modeled based \non the existing location based services like nFoursquare [23]. \n Security from malicious information: In order to \ncorrupt the system, a hacker may try to inject \nwrong location information to the Traffic server. \nThe chances of the system getting corrupted due to nlittle malicious location information are unlikely as \nlong as the percentage of malicious information is ngreater than the percentage of valid information.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nOur work provides an optimal solution that 


can guide the \ncommuter on the commute path as well as support the traffic \ndepartment to ensure smooth traffic flow in real time.\nTraffic jams wastes commuter’s time, wastes fuel and has \nan impact on the environment. Our work can curb the social \nproblems associated with traffic jams.\nVIII FUTURE ENHANCEMENT\nIn any traffic congestion, the congestion in a junction is \nexpected to spread across the neighboring junctions in \ntime‘t’. If the information on possible traffic congestion is \nknown, then it is easy to manage the traffic, by taking \nnecessary actions.  In today’s scenario, the traffic police \nman at the congested junction is expected to communicate \nthe possibility of congestion to the traffic policemen at the \nneighboring junctions. This is unlikely to happen as the \npoliceman will be busy handling the traffic. The solution nprovided in this paper can be extended by analyzing the data \nin the Crowd Data Source. Thereby, probable patterns of \ncongestion can be built and the information can be used to \nalert the policemen in the junctions automatically.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Mr.SureshKumar, \nAssistant SubInspector Mrs.Sheelavathy, Assistant\nSubInspector and Mr.Prasanna Kumar of TMC, Bangalore \nCity Traffic Police, for their cooperation and invaluable \ninput in enumerating the current practices used for handling \nthe traffic problem.

SLIM also performs 6-8 times better\nthan the SR approach, the margin between the approaches\ndecreases with increasing number of users and triggers.\n4 S M performance\nof the two approaches for safe value container computation\nfor single-dimensional data, namely single and multiple safe\nvalue container computation.

At high data frequency \(low update period the single and multiple approaches is nominal.\nHowever, as we increase the update period, a significant gap\nappears between the number of updates processed by the\napproaches. This is due to the data values jumping between\nthe multiple safe value containers leading to significantly\nlarger number of dropped updates. Figure 9\(b multiple safe value container\n56\napproach does not perform significantly worse than the single\nsafe value container approach, although the container com-\nputation times for this approach are a little higher Similar\nresults are experienced as we increase the rate of change of\ndata values [11].\nVII. RELATED WORK\nAn event-based location reminder system has been advo-\ncated by many human computer interaction projects 17],\n[18], [19]. In the realm of information monitoring, event-based\nsystems have been developed to deliver relevant information\nto users on demand [20]. The SLIM system also needs to\ndeal with the complexity of monitoring continuously changing\ndata from multiple data sources in order to trigger relevant\nalerts in a non-intrusive manner. [21] provides a brief survey\non continuous distributed monitoring. Different flavors of\nmonitoring distributed data have been proposed [22], [23] but\nnone aim to utilize interaction between multiple attributes.\nIn the field of location-based queries, periodic reevaluation\napproach is commonly used for continuous monitoring of\nmoving objects [24], [25]. The SLIM system differs from this\nwork in two aspects Firstly, our installed spatial triggers do\nnot demand periodic evaluation or reevaluation like continuous\nqueries; instead they require one-shot evaluation which should\nresult in a notification being sent to the user when the\ntrigger activation conditions are satisfied. Secondly, unlike the\nSLIM system, none of the previous work explores interaction\nbetween different attributes for information processing in mo-\nbile systems. Streaming data processing optimizations include\nbatch processing methods [7] or approximation processing [6]\nto handle the large amounts of data. Fortunately, our problem\ndefines a finite number of objects for which an infinite amount\nof continuously evolving information is being delivered. This\nmakes it possible to store data corresponding to each object\nin the form of its safe value container.\nVIII CONCLUSION\nWe have presented the SLIM service as an efficient solution\nfor the mobile information monitoring 


problem in presence\nof non-spatial attributes. This paper makes three important\ncontributions towards efficiently solving the information mon-\nitoring problem in presence of spatial as well as non-spatial\nattributes. First, we show that the addition of less dynamic\nnon-spatial attributes to the mobile information mix provides\nopportunities to enhance system scalability beyond what is\npossible with spatial attributes alone. Second, we use safe\ncontainment which allows us to perform selective processing\nof data updates by seeking cooperation from data sources in\nthe information monitoring process but provides savings in\ncommunication costs. Last but not the least, we conduct ex-\ntensive experimental evaluation for a real world road network-\nbased simulator which shows that our approach makes the\nservice scalable.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe last author is partially supported by grants from NSF\nCISE NetSE and SaTC program and an IBM faculty award.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.

the effects of different recommendation radii on the\nperformance of the four schemes in terms of the average\nactual detour ratio from 8AM to 9AM of a weekday. We in-\ncrease the recommendation radius from 50 meters to 250\n446\n9meters, which increases the size of potential taxicabs that\ncan be recommended. Heuristic is not affected by such an\nincrease, since it only recommends the closest taxicab. Ran-\ndom is not signi?cantly affected, since it recommends a\ntaxicab based a random selection. But with the increase of\nradius, both Advanced and Basic have better actual detour\nratios, because a large recommendation radius gives them\nmore taxicabs to select for a better recommendation. Also,\nwith the increase of radius, Advanced always outperforms\nBasic, which con?rms our observations in the previous\nsubsections.\n2 Different Radii: Figure 16 shows\nthe effects of different recommendation radii on percentage of\nreduced total mileage from 8-9 of a weekday. With the increase\nof the radius from 50 meters to 250 meters, the performance of\nboth versions of CallCab increases, while those of Random\nand Heuristic stay the same. But when the radius is close to\n250M, the increase for both versions of CallCab slows down,\nwhich is because the radius is large enough to have a suf?cient\nnumber of taxicabs for recommendations, and an even larger\nradius would not help.\n8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nRandom\nHeuristic\nBasic-CallCab\nAdvanced-CallCab\n%\nof\nR\ned\nuc\ned\nW\nai\ntin\ng nT\nim\ne\n\(%\n 5\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nA\nct\nua\nlD\net\nou\nr\nR\nat\nio\n\(%\n Detour Ratio VS. Dataset\nE. Percentage of Reduced Waiting Time\nIn this subsection, we show the percentage of reduced\nwaiting time due to carpooling in Figure 17. Because the\nmethod we use to calculate waiting time is based on taxicabs\npassing locations of pickup events, we present the percentage\nof reduced waiting time from hours 8 to 20 of a weekday,\ndue to the high densities of taxicabs and pickup events. Dur-\ning rush hours e.g., from 8 to 10 A.M., all systems with\ncarpool services reduce the waiting time by as much as 63%\non average. Heuristic outperforms the rest because it recom-\nmends the closest occupied taxicab for carpooling service,\nand other systems perform similarly to each other. In short,\ncarpooling services can signi?cantly reduce passenger’s\nwaiting time, when regular taxicab services are not suf?cient.\nF. Impact of Insuf?cient Datasets\nIn this subsection, we evaluate CallCab when there is no\nsuf?cient dataset for analysis. Figure 18 shows the perfor-\nmance of CallCab in terms of detour ratio in one rush hour\n8AM to 9AM of a weekday with the maximum recommen-\ndation radius, when one to ?ve days of dataset are used for\nanalysis. We observe that even though with only a dataset of\none day, CallCab still achieves satisfactory performance,\ne.g., Advanced and Basic achieves a 16% and 28% detour\nratio, respectively. When more datasets are available, the\nperformance of both versions of CallCab becomes better.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we analyze, design, and evaluate a recom-\nmendation system CallCab for both carpooling and regular\ntaxicab services in large-scale taxicab networks. CallCab\ndata mines taxicab trip distributions from historical GPS\ndatasets collected in an existing infrastructure, and recom-\nmends either a vacant taxicab with no detour distance or a\ncarpool route with a small detour distance. We employ a\ngeneric MapReduceMeasure model to ef?ciently tackle the\nraw GPS dataset to obtain recommended taxicabs. We verify\nCallCab with a real world dataset of 14, 000 taxicabs, and\nresults show that compared to ground truth, CallCab can\nsave the passenger’s initial wait time and fare, by decreasing\nboth 64% of the total mileage and 63% of the passenger’s\nwaiting time, leading to a faster and affordable service.\nIX.

3. The set of possible\narchitectures is given by the Cartesian product of the ranges\nof values in Table 3 which consists of 3,636 architectures.\n11\nFigure 11. Level 2 VASSAR, step 3b: Prepare explanations\nStakeholder requirements\nFive stakeholder groups or panels were identified for this\nexample, labeled as follows: weather climate, ecosystems,\nwater, and applications. All five panels were initially con-\nsidered equally important; a case with non-uniform weights\nis considered later in the sensitivity analysis. Note that the\npanels’ relative weights could be obtained through a formal\nmethod such as the one proposed by Cameron et al [32].\nThe specific objectives of each panel, as well as their relative\nranking, are provided in Appendix B.\nCapability rules\nNominal instrument capabilities are presented in Appendix\nA. However, architectural decisions can affect these in-\nstrument capabilities in non-trivial ways that are encoded in\nlogical rules. For example, temporal resolution and spatial\nresolution both depend on the orbital parameters. Data\nquality also depends on the orbital parameters. Below are\na few examples of situations in which data quality is severely\ncompromised due to orbital parameters.\nLighting conditions—Visible and NIR instruments \(namely\nthe corresponding channels of the IR radiometer node because they cannot gather\nenough light.\nImage distortion—Side-looking instruments cannot work at\nlow altitudes because image distortion becomes unaccept-\nable.\nEmergence rules\nEmergent behavior plays a key role in value delivery to\nstakeholders. We describe in this subsection a few examples\nof emergent behavior \(both in science and cost spatial\nresolution soil moisture dataset provided by LRADIO can be\ncombined with the lower accuracy, higher spatial resolution\ndataset provided by LSAR to produce a new high accuracy,\nmedium spatial resolution dataset.\nSample averaging—In any dataset, part of the non-systematic\nerror can be reduced by averaging samples in time or space,\nthus effectively creating a new dataset that trades accuracy\nagainst spatial or temporal resolution.\nLevel-4 data products—A level-4 net carbon ecosystem ex-\nchange dataset can be created from the combination of a\nlevel-3 soil moisture dataset and several ancillary products,\nnamely land surface temperature, vegetation state, and land-\ncover status.\nMultispectral measurements—IR and MW snow and ice cover\ndatasets can be combined to produce new, multispectral, more\naccurate datasets.\nSharing a common dish—The L-band radar and radiometer\ncan share a common antenna thus effectively reducing the\ntotal mass of the system.\nLearning Curve—If several identical satellites are developed\nand fabricated, the marginal cost of the second and subse-\nquent units is lower than the cost of the first unit due to\nlearning.\nResults\nThe set of 3,636 architectures was evaluated using VASSAR.\nThe benefit portion is based on the set of requirements from\nAppendix B. The cost portion is based on the cost model de-\nscribed in Appendix C. The point science scores and lifecycle\ncost estimates for all these architectures are shown on Figure\n12. These numbers are obtained from defuzzyfying the fuzzy\n12\nFigure 12. Expected science vs expected lifecycle cost for\n3,636 architectures \(uniform weights analysis—The main goal of any system architect-\ning tool is to gain insight into the “shape” of the tradespace,\nwhat the main trades are, whether there are families of\narchitectures, and so on. We observe several features just by\nlooking at the tradespace in Figure 12:\n\(1 a science score\nof 0. This happens when an architecture does not meet one\nor more requirements that are defined as critical to provide\nvalue, or when the instruments are put in environments where\nthey cannot operate. An example of the latter is when a side-\nlooking instrument is put at 400km, resulting in a too large\nimage distortion.\n\(2 unresolvable conflicting require-\nments. In this particular case, most of the observations\nrequire a SSO in order to get rid of diurnal variations in radi-\nance. However, a small subset of requirements that concern\noceanography or cryospheric measurements are ideally taken\nin true polar, non-SSO orbits, in order to avoid tidal aliasing\n\(oceanography cryosphere it is impossible to be in a polar\nand SSO orbit simultaneously, some value is going to be lost\nno matter what decision is made.\n\(3 costs. This is a typical behavior in\narchitectural tradespaces, that has its origins in the non-linear\nmapping between capabilities and satisfaction, namely in the\nquantization of satisfaction levels. In other words slightly\ndifferent performances may be perceived as equivalent in\nterms of satisfaction by stakeholders.\nExplanation facility—The explanation facility provides sup-\nport for more advanced analysis of the tradespace. Examples\nof the features of the explanation facility are listed below:\n\(1 The explanation facility provides\ndetailed explanations of the scores of an architecture in text\nformat as required by the user. An example of such informa-\ntion is provided in Table 4.\n\(2 support: The explanation facility\ncan provide information about one or more architectures on\nFigure 13 


Architectures with one satellite per plane high-\nlighted on the tradespace\nthe tradespace just by clicking on the corresponding points\non a chart. For example, we can obtain the details of the non-\ndominated architectures in Figure 12 by clicking on them,\nas shown in Table 5. Note that all non-dominated architec-\ntures have 800km dawn-dusk SSO, and they are monolithic\narchitectures \(all instruments are put onto a single spacecraft satellites in the constellation\n\(1 or 2 instrument on non-dominated architectures. This\nis due to the fact that it has a conflicting orbit requirement\nwith the rest of instruments, which results in an unfavorable\nscience-cost trade. In other words adding the IR instrument\nto the suite would require flying the instrument in an AM orbit\ninstead of a dawn-dusk orbit, which would negatively impact\nboth the science output of the other instruments and the cost\nof the platform.\nThe tool can also highlight the regions of the tradespace\nthat correspond to a particular combination of architectural\ndecisions. For example, Figure 13 highlights all architectures\nin which the number of satellites per plane is 1. It is easy to\nsee on this chart that it is impossible to achieve the maximum\nachievable science score with only one satellite per plane, due\nto unsatisfied temporal resolution requirements.\n\(3 advanced support, such as\nautomatic detection of common architectural features in a\nparticular region of the tradespace. For example, if we ask\nthe explanation facility to study the region in which science\nis between 0.01; 0.2], the tool automatically detects that most\nof the architectures in this region have polar, non-SSO orbits,\nas shown in Figure 14.\nFuzzy results—We emphasized earlier the large uncertainty in\nthe system architecting process, and the importance of being\nable to deal with fuzzy numbers in the RBES. It is important\nto note that conceptually, we are using fuzzy numbers for\ntwo slightly different purposes: capturing uncertainty and\ncapturing fuzziness or ambiguity. Uncertainty refers to statis-\ntical uncertainty or randomness, whereas fuzziness refers to\nnon-statistical uncertainty or vagueness. Treating statistical\nuncertainty with interval analysis is provides less information\nthan treating it with probability distribution functions \(pdf example, we are using fuzzy numbers to\n13\nTable 4.

Figure 15 shows the magnitude of\nthe uncertainty for the architectures on the Pareto frontier of\nFigure 12. The sources of uncertainty for cost are mostly\nthe standard errors from the CERs used in the cost estimation\nmodel. The sources of uncertainty for science in this example\nare the use of fuzzy scores to assess requirement satisfaction\n\(each requirement is satisfied at one of five fuzzy levels as\nexplained in the section describing fuzzy numbers.\nIt is important to note that different architectures have dif-\nferent levels of uncertainty. Uncertainty in cost is similar in\nrelative terms \(not in absolute terms mag-\nnitude [35]. However, uncertainty in science is not homoge-\nneous because a requirement fully satisfied is encoded as a\nfuzzy number with mean one and zero width, and a critical\nrequirement that is not satisfied is encoded as a fuzzy number\nwith mean zero and zero width. Thus, for the same score, dif-\nferent uncertainty 


levels are possible: if the score comes from\nsatisfying a few requirements fully and completely missing\nthe rest, uncertainty will be very low; conversely, if the score\ncomes from satisfying all or most of the requirements at an\nintermediate level \(e.g., “Most” or “Some larger.\nSensitivity Analysis—There are several ways of conducting a\nsensitivity analysis in VASSAR:\n1 simply rerunning the tool with different sets of param-\neters. In this section we provide two examples of sensitivity\nanalysis: one concerning the capabilities of the P-band SAR\nto measure soil moisture, and the other one concerning the\nrelative importance of the stakeholder panels.\nA major source of uncertainty in this piece of analysis is the\nability of the P-band SAR to provide useful measurements of\nsoil moisture, which has not yet been proven. The appeal\nof P-band SAR measurements of soil moisture is that of\nincreased soil and vegetation penetration due to the lower\nfrequency. However, most of the signal at this frequency\ncomes from soil roughness, which makes the soil moisture\nretrieval challenging [36]. Hence the question of whether this\ninstrument will be able of producing useful measurements of\n14\nFigure 14. Effect of orbit inclination on science and cost\nFigure 15. Fuzzy Science vs fuzzy lifecycle cost for non-\ndominated architectures \(uniform weights instrument does\nnot have this capability. The details of the non-dominated\narchitectures under this scenario are provided in Table 6. We\nnote several changes with respect to Table 5. First, the LSAR\ninstrument appears much more often because its combination\nwith LRADIO is the only one that can provide soil moisture\nmeasurements that satisfy the needs of the weather commu-\nnity in terms of both accuracy and spatial resolution. The\nPSAR instrument still appears in the high-cost region of the\nPareto frontier, because it is the only instrument with the\nhigh penetration capability. However, it disappears of the\nlower cost of the Pareto frontier because the extra science\ndoes not compensate the cost of developing it for the given\nstakeholder preferences. It is also noticeable that the high\ncost non-dominated architectures have now more than one\nsatellite because architectures flying the two SAR on the same\nplatform are dominated \(they are too costly become three times as\nimportant as the other panels. The details about the non-\ndominated architectures in this case are shown in Table 7.\nThis change in stakeholder preferences brings forth a major\nchange in the architectural tradespace: the best architectures\nin the high-science region of the tradespace now include\nthe IR instrument, contrary to what happened for uniform\nweights. In order to get the maximum science output out\nFigure 16. Propagation of uncertainty in payload mass to\npayload cost.\nof the IR instrument it is necessary to fly it in an AM orbit,\nwhich impacts both the science output of other instruments\nand the cost of the spacecraft.\nMore advanced variants of this option allow to compute the\nthreshold value for a parameter that makes the non-dominated\nset change. For example, the tool determined in this case that\nfor wECOwi < 2.59 the best architectures remain similar to\nthose presented in Table 5, whereas for wECOwi ? 2.59, the\nbest architectures switch to those presented in Table 7. Some\ndecision makers are more comfortable with this kind of result\nthan plain results, because they feel that they can evaluate\nthe certainty with which the statement wECOwi < 2.59 is true\nmore easily than they can assign weights to the different\nstakeholder panels.\n2 encoding any parameter as a fuzzy value. For instance,\nthe mass or the accuracy of an instrument can also be encoded\nas a fuzzy number with a certain range of values, and these\nuncertainties will be propagated to the cost and science met-\nrics. An example of the propagation of uncertainty in mass\nto cost is shown in Figure 16. The triangles represent the\ntriangular membership functions for mass and cost. Note\nthat the altitudes of these triangles are notional and do not\ncorrespond to the values in the axis. The red line shows the\ncorrespondence between scalar mass and scalar cost through\na parametric relationship embedded in the tool.\n3 merit change\nwhen each variable is changed. Note that gradients or pseudo-\ngradients cannot generally be defined in this local search\nprocess as some of the variables are categorical. Instead, rules\nare created that automatically enumerate all the architectures\nthat differ from the reference architecture in just one archi-\ntectural aspect. For example, an instruments is added to or\nremoved from the payload, or the LTAN is changed from DD\nto AM. We used VASSAR to look around the architecture\n#669, highlighted in Table 5. Eleven architectures were thus\nautomatically enumerated and evaluated. They are shown in\nFigure 17. This kind of results can be useful to determine the\noptimal evolution of an architecture, such as in determining\nan optimal descoping option in the event of a downward\nbudget.\n15\nTable 6.

Local search around architecture #669, high-\nlighted on Table 5\n4 CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a methodology to assess the value\nof a system architecture using RBES Such methodology can\nbe used in the context of automatic architectural tradespace\nexploration to develop the part of computational tools that\nautomatically evaluates the architectures being generated. An\nexample of such tool was shown in the context of Earth Ob-\nserving Satellite Systems \(EOSS is\ndivided in two parts. First, the advantages and disadvantages\nof VASSAR with respect to the state-of-the-art of system\narchitecting tools is discussed. Second, the next steps in this\nresearch project are outlined.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of VASSAR\nThe following are advantages  the\nVASSAR methodology with respect to other frameworks:\n\(1  delivery\nloop. All requirements are directly traceable to stakeholder\nneeds. All capabilities are directly traceable to architectural\ndecisions.\n\(2  e.g., sci-\nence and engineering back-\ngrounds, simply because it is the way in which the human\nmind works.\n\(3  the domain-specific\nknowledge from the domain-independent knowledge, which\ntranslates into increased scalability and reusability, and facil-\nitates task allocation between system architects and software\nengineers.\n\(4  lessons learned: it serves as\na repository of knowledge to conserve expertise, and it also\nuses the lessons learned in the form of logical rules to evaluate\nsystem architectures.\n\(5  delivery loop facilitates more\n16\noptimal task allocation between man \(the system architect the computational tool architectures and through the use of the text-\nbased and graphics-based explanation facility. The system\narchitect feeds the tool with knowledge, guides the tradespace\nexploration process, and makes all non-objective decisions.\n\(6  of recursive algorithms, which\nare at the core of modeling emergence, which in turn is the\norigin of value.\n\(7  8  a computational price, which is only\nworth it if the knowledge base is likely to evolve.\n\(9  slow when the number of rules is very\nlarge.\n\(10  the expert knowledge \(e.g. lessons learned specific\npurpose: evaluating system architectures in the context of\nautomatic architectural tradespace exploration. Using this\nmethodology, a tool was created to evaluate architectures in\nthe context of Earth Observing Satellite Systems. Some of\nthe next steps concern the methodology itself, while others\nconcern this tool.\nConcerning the methodology, the extension of VASSAR’s\nexplanation facility with more advanced features requires\nthe incorporation of a machine learning layer on top of the\nRBES. This type of hybrid AI tool is seen as a potentially\nfruitful area of research. Furthermore, this paper focused\non the use of RBES for the valuation portion of the system\narchitecting process. RBES can be used in other aspects of\nthe architecting process. A similar framework has been cre-\nated that allows automatic enumeration of several canonical\ntypes of architectures using RBES [37]. This framework is\ncontinuously being improved with more efficient algorithms\nof enumerating certain classes of architectures. Finally, the\ncurrent VASSAR implementation is restrictive in terms of\nrepresentation of architectures, as they need to be represented\nas lists of pairs decision-value. A more advanced version\nof the tool could allow importing architectures expressed in\nmore powerful representation tools such as SysML or OPM.\nConcerning the tool, the knowledge base can be improved in\nseveral points, but not all improvements would have the same\nimpact on the fidelity of the tool. For instance, it is unlikely\nthat a more accurate ?V budget would result in very different\nresults. Two examples where the improvement would yield a\nhigh return in modeling fidelity are discussed below.\nFirst, the spacecraft design algorithm could benefit from a\nhigher-fidelity configuration module that accounts for the\nposition of the main spacecraft components and provides\nmore accurate estimations of the dimensions and moments\nof inertia of the spacecraft.\nSecond, the cost model uses cost estimating relationships\n\(CERs are old and have very large standard errors.\nHigher fidelity cost models could be used instead of these\nTable

Bus cost is based on the parametric relationships\nprovided in SMAD \([35 these parametric are based\non the spacecraft mass budget, a spacecraft design module\nthat estimates the mass and power budgets of each spacecraft\nprecedes the cost estimation module.\nThe spacecraft design module is iterative because of the\ncouplings between different subsystems. For example, the\nmass of the spacecraft affects the design of the ADCS through\nthe size of the reaction wheels and the amount of propellant\namongst others, and these feed back into the computation of\nthe spacecraft mass. In practice, three iterations are sufficient\nto make the design process converge to a precision of less\nthan a kg.\nAn overview of the spacecraft design module is provided in\nFigure 20.\nOnce the mass, power, and delta-V budgets have been cal-\nculated, the different components of lifecycle cost shown\nin Figure 19 can be computed using the cost estimating\nrelationships in SMAD.\n18\nFigure 18.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles. The package totals 218.2 kg which includes four remote units, five instruments, one hub, and the carrier container\(s Table 5.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
