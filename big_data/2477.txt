Enhancing the Quality of Information in Inter-Organizational Environmental\nReporting Information Systems\nHans Thies \nUniversity of St. Gallen \nhans.thies@unisg.ch \nKatarina Stanoevska-Slabeva \nUniversity of St. Gallen nkatarina.stanoevska@unisg.ch \nAbstract \nEnvironmental reporting has become standard \nwithin big and medium-sized international \ncompanies. However, organizations face many \nknowledge management challenges in environmental \nreporting, such as data availability, comparability, \nflexibility, and high costs. Some of these challenges \ncan be mitigated by inter-organizational \nenvironmental reporting information systems IO-\nERIS nstate of the art in environmental reporting, extracting \nthe requirements for information quality in nenvironmental reporting, and proposes an approach \nof how the quality of environmental information in nIO-ERIS can be enhanced following the design \nscience research cycle. \n1. Introduction\nDuring the last decade, the awareness for safe \nand environmental friendly products has been \ngrowing constantly [1]. This changed economic \nbackground has led to many opportunities for the \nparticipating organizations. Nevertheless many \ncompanies are also challenged in numerous ways. \nApart from normative pressures shaping \norganizational responses, social, legislative [2] and \ncompetitive [3] factors drive the need for exchanging \nsustainability information within the supply chain. \nSocial environmental awareness is an important \ndriver for companies to extend their responsibility for \nproducts and make sure they are environmental \nfriendly [4]. Besides maximizing short-term profit, \norganizations are increasingly being held accountable \nfor their impacts on society and environment [5].\nMore and more environmental directives have been \npassed during the last years the majority in the \nEuropean Union \(EU are to be enacted \nworldwide [6]. The positive financial impact of \nenvironmental improvements has been outlined by a \nplethora of authors [7]. Besides environmental \ninformation, sustainability reporting typically covers \nsocial and economic performance [8]. This research \nexplicitly focuses on the environmental dimension of \nsustainability reporting. Data availability, \ncomparability, flexibility, and costs have been \nidentified as main challenges in environmental \nreporting [9], while Information technology \(IT a key enabler for sustainability \n[10]. Solutions to mitigate the above mentioned \nproblems are platforms which connect organizations \nthroughout the supply chain and support the \nexchange of sustainability data and indicators. In the \nsub-domain of environmental reporting, these \nplatforms here referred to as inter-organizational \nenvironmental reporting information systems \(IO-\nERIS suppliers, to \nconnect to environmental databases and third-party \ninformation, and to pass on this information to \nrelevant stakeholders. The paper at hand addresses \nthree research questions: first, what is the status quo \nin environmental reporting; second, what are \nrequirements for information quality in nenvironmental reporting; and third, how can the \ninformation quality in environmental reporting be \nimproved leveraging IO-ERIS.  \n2. Methodology \nFor answering the research questions motivated \nin the previous section and characterized by a \npractical nature, the design science approach was \nadopted [11]. Design science research aims at solving \npractical and theoretical problems by creating and \nevaluating IT artifacts intended to solve identified \norganizational problems. Hence, it is considered as a \nproblem-oriented approach [11]. To come to rigorous \nand relevant research results, we draw upon on [12] \nto specify the following phases of the design science \nresearch process applied: \nProblem Identification and Motivation. In the \nfirst section a summary of drivers for IO-ERIS was \npresented, the research problem was specified, and \nthe practical relevance of a solution was discussed. \n2013 46th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences\n1530-1605/12 $26.00 © 2012 IEEE\nDOI 10.1109/HICSS.2013.198\n34935\nBased on the problem scope, the research questions \nguiding this paper were defined. \nDefine the Objectives for a Solution. The \nproblem scope was assessed based on the existing \nliterature in relevant research fields and in \ncooperation with industry representatives. Five case \ncompanies served as basis for requirements \nidentification. Relevant literature is discussed in \nchapter 3, while chapter 4 describes the state of the \nart environmental reporting based on the five industry \ncases. \nDesign. Leveraging the requirements extracted \nfrom literature and the industry cases a two-folded \napproach to enhance information quality in IO-ERIS\nwas developed. Chapter 5 outlines the requirements \nfor information quality in environmental reporting. In \nchapter 6, an approach to enhance information \nquality in IO-ERIS is presented.   \nDemonstration and Evaluation. A first \nevaluation of the proposed approach, based on a \nprototypical IO-ERIS, gives a first indication of \nvalidity for the concept The results are described in \nchapter 7. Chapter 8 summarizes the paper and gives \nan outlook to further research. \n3. Related Work \nFour relevant streams of literature have been \nidentified for this research IO-ERIS constitute a \nparticular type of knowledge management systems. \nAcademic papers on environmental reporting outline \nwhat open research questions and challenges are. \nLiterature on information quality is used 


as a \nfoundation to identify information quality challenges \nin the state of the art and develop an artifact to \nmitigate these. Finally academic papers on \nincentives, in particular in content-based information nsystems \(IS organizations to contribute high-quality \nenvironmental information. \n3.1. Knowledge Management Systems \nIn the past years, there has been a growing \ninterest in knowledge as a significant organizational \nresource 13]. In particular, IS play a key role to \nsystemize and enhance inter-firm knowledge \nmanagement [13]. This work follows the perspective \nthat knowledge is information possessed in the mind \nof individuals [13]. In general, tacit and explicit \nknowledge are explicated [14]. Knowledge \nmanagement systems \(KMS class of \ninformation systems applied to managing knowledge. \nThey are geared towards enabling users to assign nmeaning to information and to capture knowledge in \ninformation [13]. Literature identifies three main napplications of KMS: \(1 2 ndirectories, and \(3 these two application areas. Also, [13] \ndefines four processes involved in KMS: \(1 2 retrieval, \(3 4 knowledge is the central aspect of IO-\nERIS. Knowledge transfer has conceptualized in \nmore detail by [15 Knowledge transfers can occur at \nvarious levels: This work treats the transfer of \nknowledge between individuals within an \norganization, but more importantly between different \norganizations. One important aspect is that also \n“soft” factors, such as the willingness to share play \nan important role. Section 6.2 deals with this aspect \nby analyzing appropriate motives for sharing \ninformation in IO-ERIS. The particular value of tacit \nknowledge in environmental improvements has been \nhighlighted by [16]. The economic value of nknowledge has received growing interest by \nacademia and practitioners, highlighting one \nfundamentally different aspect of knowledge as an \neconomic good: “It can be used without being \nconsumed” [17]. Knowledge has been identified as \nan important factor for financial growth, regional \ndevelopment, and economies [18 Knowledge on \nenvironmental performance has been identified as an \nenabler for financial profitability driving company \ngrowth, profitability, and stock performance [7]. \n3.2. Environmental Reporting \nThe term sustainability was substantially \ninfluenced by the Brundlandt report, which defined \nsustainability in the context of sustainable \ndevelopment: ”Sustainable development meets the \nneeds of the present without compromising the ability \nof future generations to meet their own needs” [19].\nWhile at first focusing on environmental \nsustainability, the concept has later been extended to \nthe triple bottom line of environmental, social, and \nfinancial sustainability as coined by [8].\n79% of the world’s largest companies G250  be \nreleased as part of the annual financial report. In \ngeneral, sustainability reports are released on an nannual basis. A sustainability report “provides a \nsnapshot of an organization’s progress towards \nintegrated economic growth, environmental \nstewardship and social responsibility” [21]. It creates \n34946\nvalue in terms of benchmarking, as it enables the \nevaluation of the extent to which sustainability-\nrelated laws, norms codes, performance standards, \nand voluntary initiatives are followed. Furthermore, \nsustainability reports can ideally be used to compare \nperformance either within the company or across \ndifferent companies over time 22] and help \nincreasing operational efficiency [7]. In a survey, the \nlargest 100 companies by revenue N100  considerations \n\(69 68 55 and \nlearning \(55 nlaw or regulation that obliges a company to report on \nits overall environmental performance. However, \nsome regulations require the publication on specific \nenvironmental-related topics [23]. One example is the \nToxic Release Inventory that specifies reporting on \ntoxic substances in the United States \(US regulative requirements, [24] identifies \nthat there are various stakeholders with different \nexpectations groups that put pressure on companies \nto release voluntary sustainability reports. The first \nkey group includes important stakeholders such as \nshareholders, financial institutions and employees. \nThey are increasingly expecting companies to be \nresponsible, accountable and transparent about \nsustainable development. The second key group \nincorporates international organizations such as the \nUnited Nations Global Compact \(UN Global \nCompact ISO Reporting \nInitiative \(GRI GHG nProtocol performance communication. In short, \nthe GRI comprises what to report on \(EPIs the overlying environmental \nmanagement system and the GHG Protocol details \nhow to report.  \nEnvironmental 


Performance Indicators \(EPIs quantitative EPIs, however many \nsustainability reports still lack accurate quantitative \nEPIs. [25] provides an introduction to the topic of \nenvironmental performance evaluation and indicators \nbased on the ISO standard ISO 14031, focusing on \nquantitative EPIs. She argues that the focus must be \non consistent definition of system boundaries and \nreference units. As of today, the GRI has developed \nthe most commonly used set of EPIs, within a \nframework of diverse sustainability indicators. \n3.3. Information Quality \nThe term quality in general refers to certain \nproperties and conditions of an object or service. \nAlthough quality is considered an objective attribute, \nit often includes perceptual, conditional or subjective nfeatures. [26] defines quality as “the degree to which \na set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements.”\nOther definitions have focused on the number of \ndefects [27], or the fitness for use [28 29] have \ndeveloped a two-by-two matrix \(“product and service \nperformance model for information quality PSP/IQ matrix \nis displayed in table 1. Aspects of EPI quality have \nbeen previously defined, e.g. by the Global nResources \(GRI n“conforms to specifications” aspects of product \nquality according to [29]. The GRI [22] defines the nfollowing quality dimensions: \nRelevance refers to the closeness of the \noperational definition of the indicator to the \nenvironmental problem to be measured and the \nmethodology chosen. Completeness describes nwhether all relevant activities within the chosen \nboundaries are included. Any exclusion should be njustified. Consistency refers to the use of consistent \nmethodologies. Changes to the data, inventory nboundary, methods, or any other relevant factors \nshould be documented properly. Transparency \naddresses whether the quantification of the EPIs can \nbe reconstructed by a third person. All relevant \nassumptions accounting and calculation \nmethodologies, and data sources should be disclosed.\nAccuracy describes how close the reported value is to \nthe actual one and that uncertainties are reduced as \nfar as practicable. Overall accuracy represents issues \nsuch as comparability of data, reliability of data \nsources, coverage of the indicator, reliability of the \nmethodology used and whether the results could be \nvalidated. \nTable 1.

Incentives for Content-Based IS\nA motive has been defined as the psychological \ndisposition of an individual [30]. The activation of a \nmotive can be triggered by internal motives \(e.g. a \ndesire e.g. a payment  on motives in \norder to activate a certain behavior [32]. In the case \nof IO-ERIS, incentives to join the solution and \nincentives to contribute content have to be \ndistinguished. As stated by [33], some organizations \nseek to fulfill other goals besides maximizing \nshareholder profits. These goals are oriented at the \nentrepreneur’s values and include the “well-being of \nother members of his organization and his fellow ncitizens” [33]. Ethical considerations can be an \nintrinsic motivation for organizations to improve \ntheir environmental impact by joining and \nstrengthening IO-ERIS. A number of authors are \ndescribing incentives for taking part in content-based \nIS. Organizations can expect direct payoffs from \njoining such networks. In the case of IO-ERIS, these \ninclude the above mentioned process improvements \nof better data availability flexibility, transparency, \nand efficiency. Depending on the business model, \nthere could also be direct monetary compensations \nfor joining the network, e.g. the solution owner could \nemploy a referral bonus system 34] where Original \nEquipment Manufacturers \(OEMs  have analyzed how individual motives and \nsocial capital influence users to share information in \ncommunities of practice. They study the following \nfactors: reputation, enjoyment, network centrality, \nexpertise, tenure commitment and reciprocity. They \nfind reputation, enjoyment, network centrality and \nexpertise to be statistically significant influencers of \nknowledge contribution.  \n[36] identify factors that motivate users to \ncontribute resources to P2P networks including \nrewards, personal need, altruism, reputation, liking, \nand affiliation and propose application features to \nstimulate resource contribution. They do not specify \nthe type of tangible reward provided, but list \nmonetary rewards, discount rates for subscription or \npurchase bonus points for prize remedy and value-\nadding service. Furthermore they suggest an \nindividual identity and profile generation to promote \nsub-community building, and peer recommendations \nin order to evaluate contributions to the network. [37] \nelaborate on a number of incentives for community \ncontribution, and based on that build an incentive \nsystem for a social networking site in a business \ncontext. They suggest including 


features that provide \nrewards, explain the benefit for the community, set \nspecific individual goals, provide reputation, and \nprovide and illustrate a self-benefit. When \nincentivizing user contributions, [38] highlight that \nthe quality of the contributions has to be controlled: \nA high amount of low quality contribution can lead to \ninformation overload which makes users leave the \ncommunity.

Current organizational practices \nThe state of the art in environmental reporting \nwas identified by investigating the current practices \nin five case companies: An industrial research center \n\(A elevator/ escalator manufacturer \(B C D E maintaining operations \nworldwide. The case studies included an analysis of \npublicly available material, an interview with the \nresponsible sustainability reporting officer \(SRO responsible for \ndata entry and communication, and three workshops \nincluding all five companies where the challenges as \nwell as the solution approach were discussed. In the \nfollowing, we will describe a consolidated process of \ncorporate communication. \n34968\n4.1. General Process Specification \nThe first step in environmental communication is \nto identify the relevant stakeholders. Literature\nmentions two main approaches for identifying the \nrelevant stakeholders [39], either focusing on \nstakeholders with high impact or stakeholders which \nare influenced by the company’s operations. All case \ncompanies target their environmental reports at \ncustomers; employees as well as the interested public \nare particularly addressed by two of the companies. \nOther stakeholder groups include analysts, investors, \nsuppliers, NGO’s, as well as educational institutions.\nNext, the scope and the boundaries of the EPI \nhave to be specified. This includes of how to nincorporate facilities and operations that are 100% or \npartially under control of the organization, leased nfacilities, outsourced / third party services and \noperations, and sourced materials / energy. Based on \nthe scope and boundaries defined, an asset list can \nserve as first step towards the identification of EPI nsources determining the EPIs. The asset list is usually \nalready available in an organizational ERP. Emission nsources mainly fall into the categories facilities, \nmobile assets, travel, and services. \nThe next step is to decide which granularity of \ndata is required. Resource consumption is \ntraditionally reported geographically. This is also the \nrequirement of external reporting standards. \nAdditionally, the cost center structure of \norganizations can be leveraged to break down \nresource consumption equally to all full time nequivalents \(FTEs environmental reporting lead, the role of \ndata providers entering the actual data, the role of a \ndata owner approving the data, and the role of \ninternal/ external auditors. After the overall data \ncollection approach has been defined and the \nassumptions have been clarified, the activity data has \nto be collected. The activity data is the data of the \nactual activity or process quantifying an \nenvironmental impact. This can be data which \ndirectly measures the activity, such as the gas \nconsumption of a car, or data that can be used to ndetermine the activity or its impact, such as amount \nof kilometers travelled by car. Unit processes nleveraging suitable conversion factors are used to \nrelate the measured activity to the actual impact, such nas a quantification formula that determines the Global \nWarming Potential \(GWP nDiesel gasoline. The data management finally \nclarifies how the data is entered, stored, merged ntransmitted, and accessed by the predefined roles. \nRegular environmental communication efforts, such \nas quarterly or yearly sustainability reports, have a \ngiven structure which only evolves from time to time nThis means that the underlying data sources which \nare represented in the report do not change \nsignificantly from report to report. Most of the effort \nis currently related to the \(often manual as data from each facility or site has to be \nadapted and then put in the system. For some data \nsuch as CO2 emissions of business flights, there are \nthird parties involved that own the data sources \nand/or do the calculations. Environmental data is \ncurrently stored in multiple databases and formats \nwithin the company The reason for this is that most \ntools are specially designed for one group of \nenvironmental data \(e.g. LCA 


data ISO 14001 \nseries are the most commonly acknowledged \nstandards in the domain of environmental reporting \n\(see chapter 3.2 communication efforts are triggered by a \ncertain event or goal that arises during operative \nbusiness. This could be a situation where the \norganization has been criticized for a certain behavior \nor “bad” EPIs, a marketing campaign that wants to \nstress the organization’s efforts to protect the \nenvironment, or a specific report demanded by a \ncustomer. The main difference to regular efforts is \nthat \(a specific and have not yet \nbeen treated within the organization and \(b faster. Therefore, ad-hoc \nreports can often not be completed in quality. \n4.2. Information Quality Challenges nThis section provides a description of the current \nchallenges in environmental reporting based on the \nfive case companies. \nA main problem is the general availability of \nhigh-quality environmental data Company-related \nenvironmental data is scattered within the \norganization, while product- or supply chain-related \ndata is even scattered across organizational borders. \nTo include cradle-to-gate data companies have to \ncollect EPIs throughout the whole supply chain and \nestablish connections to all their sub-suppliers for \nmaking product assessments. Until today the data \nrequests are difficult and response rates extremely \nlow. Differing standards and collection methods \ncomplicate the process. Public databases are often nimprecise or lack data for the exact required \nmaterials. Consequently, EPIs often have to be \nestimated or calculated based on proxy data. For \nexample, the SRO of company B mentioned that \n34979\nsince their suppliers do not provide data of the \nenvironmental impact for steel components, they \nhave to estimate it using average data. Thus a central \nchallenge in environmental reporting is to capture \nand exchange both tacit and explicit environmental \ninformation scattered across organizational borders \nproviding stimuli which trigger cognitive processing \nresulting in individual knowledge [13]. \nIn sustainability reporting, the transparency is \nvery limited due to different EPIs and baselines. Not \nonly is it impossible to compare the sustainability \nreports because of different data included, but even \ncomparing the EPI of an organization with the value \nof the preceding year is difficult due to changing \namount of products produced, changing product \nportfolio changing number of employees, mergers \nand acquisitions etc. The responsible person in \ncompany C elaborated that they had currently sold a \nsubsidiary leading to significant CO2 improvements, \nwhile the rest of this company had in fact mostly \nhigher CO2 emissions due to an increase in sales. In \norder to gain a useful comparison, one would firstly \nneed to be sure that both companies use the same \nmeasurement methods and assumptions. Secondly, \nthe same rounding method and way of extrapolation \nshould be used. Thirdly, it should be known whether \nthe data of both companies is measured or assumed. \nHowever, most importantly it has to be ensured that \nthe indicator of the companies include the same \nattributes. Currently, data is often compared without \nmaking these considerations which then leads to \nmeaningless results. Even when the same EPI nquantification approach has been used, two \norganizations should only be compared with caution. \nParticular reasons for this are the different \norganizational structures, product portfolios and \ngeographical regions of operation. Therefore, the \nreports are not easily interpretable by any user \nwithout a strong environmental reporting \nbackground. \nDue to complex processes and little automation, \ncurrent approaches are very slow and inflexible.\nDefinition and implementation of EPIs can take up to \na year and more, accessing all data required and \ncalculating EPIs up to 6 months due to the manual \nprocesses involved. This makes it impossible to nquickly react to socio-economic changes or specific \ncrisis situations. If a new indicator that an norganization would like to report on does not exist \nwithin the company, its ease of implementation \ndepends on whether the necessary data has already \nbeen collected or measured somewhere. Although \ncompany D had the most advanced infrastructure for \nsustainability reporting set up, the SRO argued that \nthe processes were seldom integrated with existing \nbusiness processes, which made them very slow and \nerror-prone. In many cases, he still had to collect data \nvia spreadsheet and e-mail. This is not only an issue \nof data availability and process costs, but also of the \ncritical reaction time to emerging events.  \nThe current process is often characterized by \ntime-consuming information retrieval from different \ndatabases spreadsheets and other information \nsources even across organizational boarders.  Since \nthe data is scattered within the organization or even \nacross its boarders, a huge number of employees has \nto be involved. Due to the lack of automation and \nincompatible formats and processes, the costs of \ncreating an environmental report are \ndisproportionately high. The SRO of company C\noutlined that all employees included in the process nexceeded the number of 1,000.  In addition, there is \noften a lack of capable human resources in the data ngathering process.  \n5. Information Quality Requirements \nThe previous chapter has outlined the current nchallenges of data availability, transparency, and \ncomparability. Since regulatory requirements for data 


nquality have not yet been introduced, this paper \nproposes the use of IS and a community-based \napproach to enhance data quality. The dimensions of \ninformation quality in environmental reporting \noutlined before can be translated into particular \nrequirements for an IO-ERIS. In order to ensure \nrelevance of the EPIs reported within the IO-ERIS, \nthe EPIs should be based on established standards,\nsuch as the GRI accounting principles The relevant \nstakeholders should be included in the system so an \niterative process to adapt the base of indicators based \non their requirements can be established. The \ncompleteness of the EPIs can be documented by nproviding all activities that have been included, and \nthe scope of these, to the user. A completeness-check ncan compute whether any data within the specified \nboundaries has been left out. Consistency can be \nenhanced by providing additional information on \ntime, location, and context of the activities included. \nA traffic-light approach can be used to quickly \nvisualize whether two EPIs are consistent regarding \ntheir context, properties and methodology. \nComparisons and benchmarks with other companies \ncan disseminate best-practices and identify obvious \ninconsistencies. In order to provide transparency,\nmeta-information on data source, data type, and data \nowner certainty should be provided as well as the \nmethodology used, tools involved, and roles involved \nin determining the EPI. The accuracy can be \nimproved by a reputation-based incentive scheme \n3498500\n\(explained in more detail in the following section validation of the data. \nTable 3 summarizes the information quality \nrequirements in IO-ERIS. \nTable 3 Information quality requirements \nQuality \ndimension\nRequirements\nRelevance\n EPIs should be based on established standards \n\(e.g. GRI activities included and scope of the\nEPI\n Completeness-check in order to determine if \nany data within specified boundaries are \nmissing\nConsistency\n Provide context \(time, location, scope Traffic light for consistency shall be provided  \nwhen using or comparing EPIs\n Allow for comparisons between companies and \nbenchmarking\nTransparency\n Provide properties of EPI \(data source, data \ntype, data owner certainty scheme\n Provide information on external validation\n6. Enhancing the Quality of Information \nin IO-ERIS \nThe identified information quality requirements \nresult in two main measures: Documenting and \nproviding meta-information of the environmental \ndata within the IO-ERIS, and a reputation-based \nincentive scheme which encourages organizations to \ncontribute high-quality information and provides \nquality rankings to the users of the system. \n6.1. Proving Meta-Information in IO-ERIS \nThe smaller the existing shared knowledge space \nin a group, the greater the need for contextual \ninformation [13]. This relevant meta-information has \nto be provided on different data entity levels. E.g. for \nactivities, exact information on context and properties ncan be provided as illustrated by table 4. The context \nincludes time, location, and scope of the data. As ndescribed in chapter four, the quantification of EPIs \ncan take place either based on direct activity data or nactivity data relying on unit processes. The activity \ndata type is particularly relevant to document, as it ndirectly impacts the accuracy of the data provided. As \na general rule, companies should apply the following nhierarchy of data types in collecting data of \norganizational accounting.  \nTable 4. Meta-information by data entity \nData entity Meta information\nActivity\n Context \(Time, location, scope Quantification method, data type, \ndata owner certainty Time, activity proportions of \nlocation and scope Properties \(Activity proportions of \nquantification method, data type, and data \nowner certainty Process steps, roles included, \ntools involved rating\n External validations\nPrimary data are direct emissions measurements \nor activity data. Companies should obtain the most \nproduct-specific data available. Primary data can be \nfurther classified in product-level data, process-level \ndata, facility-level data, business unit-level data, and \ncorporate-level data. Secondary data are data that are \nnot collected from specific sources within a \ncompany's operations or its supply chain. Secondary \ndata include industry-average data, data from \nliterature studies, and data from published databases. \nExtrapolated data are primary or secondary data \nrelated to a similar \(but not representative a new situation to make \nit more representative \(for example, by customizing \nthe data to the relevant region technology, process, \ntemporal period and/or product similar \(but not \nrepresentative transferred or \ngeneralized to the input, process, or activity of \ninterest without being adapted or customized to make \nmore representative. \nData type 3 and 4 are estimation methods to fill \ndata gaps. The type of data used shall be properly \ndocumented and displayed within the system. On the \nlevel of EPIs, the proportions \(e.g. which percentage \nof the EPI is based on direct EPI values respectively \nunit processes be calculated and displayed. The \nmethodology is relevant for the entire environmental \nreport and therefore 


should be displayed at this entity \nlevel. The same holds for external validations, which \nare usually at the level of the environmental report. In \norder not to overstrain the efforts of the users \nproviding quality ratings, the rating should also take \nplace at this level.  \n6.2. Reputation-based Incentive Scheme \nBased on the identification of motives and the \nnature of the environmental content that is required,\n3499501\nthere are a number of features and functionalities that \nthe system should inherit. Designing for enjoyment \nhas been previously defined as key for IT artifacts. In \nparticular, positive experience should be created by a \nuser interface which promotes pleasure, enjoyment, \nand fun in order to enable user satisfaction [40]. The \nsystem should also be easy to use. Community-\nbuilding features and designing for sociability is \nrequired to fulfill the desire of individuals to \nparticipate in communities. E.g. [41] have identified \na number of principles that facilitate sociability in \nsocial software. Comparability within the community \nshould also be enabled in order to facilitate an \nadvantageous competition [37]. There are a number \nof incentives which could be offered based on the \nquantity and quality of contributions: These include \nreduced fees, the incorporation in supplier npurposes. Additionally, the motive to enhance \ncustomer satisfaction can be supported by offering \nsuitable tools for sharing data and communicating \nwith the customer [9]. Reputation is mentioned as an \nimportant motive to stimulate user contributions [35–\n37], so the system should be able to compute a \nreputation score for the participants, and offer \n“badges” or “membership levels” in order to promote \nspecific actions [37 38]. Table 5 summarizes the \nincentives to encourage content contribution. Most \nincentives to join the network are related to a \nconvincing value proposition, thus have to be \nimplemented via comprehensive characteristics and \nfunctionality of the IO-ERIS itself. The goal of the \nincentive system therefore focuses on enhancing user \ncontributions. Based on the considerations presented \nin the previous sections, the reputation mechanism \nshould encourage uploading up-to-date \nEnvironmental Performance Indicators \(EPIs high \nquantity and quality and accurately rating user \ncontributions. Consequently we propose to \ndistinguish a reputation score for contributing EPIs \nand for rating EPIs, and provide additional incentives \nbased on these two scores. \nTable 5. IO-ERIS motives & incentives \nMotive Incentive\nEnjoyment User friendly user interface\nCommunity Community building features\nLow fees Reduce fees based on contributions\nCustomer satisfaction Sharing & communication tools\nReputation Reputation score & badges\nSupplier evaluation nscore\nInclude contributions in supplier \nevaluations\nSophisticated \nfunctionality\nProvide functionality based on \ncontributions\nAccess to industry data Provide data access based on contributions\nDue to the high number of user contributions, it \nis impossible to employ enough resources to rate all \ncontent according to its quality. Depending on the \ncommercial success, quality checks based on random \nsampling, such as the Continuous Sampling Plan 1 \n\(CSP-1  be done by the \ncommunity. This is less problematic than in many \nconsumer networks, as many of the business users \nwill indeed be domain experts. [38] present an \nadaptive incentive mechanism for contributing and nrating content in an e-learning community which \nshares some of the features with the proposed \nmechanism Due to the completely different context, \nthe focus of [38]’s mechanism is to promote a certain \nnumber of user participations within a limited amount \nof time, while the focus of the proposed incentive \nscheme is to determine the quality of user \ncontributions in order to promote quantity and quality \nof contributions.  \nWe suggest calculating a quality score for every \nEPI, based on all ratings for the EPI and the \nparticipating business user’s historical rating \nexpertise. Whether organizations and business users \nhave to be distinguished depends on the actual use \ncase. Based on the deviation of all ratings of a \nbusiness user from the EPI quality scores, his \nindividual rating expertise score is calculated. Before \nthe rating is submitted the user cannot see the EPI \nquality score. This prohibits a bias towards the \ndisplayed score as well as provides an additional \nincentive for rating. The aggregation of the rating \ndeviations to a rating expertise score, as well as the \naggregation of the EPI quality scores to an overall \ncontent quality score can be done leveraging diverse \nalgorithms [43]. Figure 1 depicts the basic functional \nprinciple of the proposed reputation system, which \nprovides the basis for incentives such as further \ndissemination of the reputation monetary incentives, \nincorporation in supplier evaluations, enhanced \nfunctionality, or access to a larger amount of \nindustrial data. \nContent \nReputation \nscore\nRating \nExpertise \nScore\nEPI 1 Quality \nScore\nEPI m Quality \nScore\nRating 1 on \nEPI 1\nEPIs\nOrganizations\nRating n on \nEPI 1\nRatings\nDeviation \nfrom EPI \nQuality Score\nFigure 1.

The \napproach was implemented based on a prototypical \nIO-ERIS \(see figure 2 for an illustration of how meta-\ninformation is displayed in the prototype 


experts agreed that this concept has \nthe potential to improve the overall data quality \nwithin the IO-ERIS The consortium partners will be \nusing the system and evaluate it based on defined test \ncases. This will provide the basis for a more detailed \nevaluation in the future. The main statements of the \nevaluation workshop are summarized below: \n The information quality challenges in \nenvironmental reporting cannot be solved by \ntechnical means alone. It will require the \ninvolvement of industry and legislation to \ndefine unambiguous standards. \n The transparency provided by the prototypical \nIO-ERIS could help to accelerate the formation \nof de-facto standards. \n The expert evaluations can provide a very \nvaluable first estimation of data quality, in \nparticular for non-experts, who are the main \nusers of IO-ERIS. \n All meta-information was found very useful. \nExpert users particularly found the context and \nproperties information useful, while non-experts \npreferred the automated traffic lights and \ncompleteness checks. \nThe research at hand contributes to the academic \nstate of the art in knowledge systems by defining the \nsub-domain of IO-ERIS and particular requirements \nfor information quality in the domain of \nenvironmental reporting. These results are further of \npractical relevance for improving the outcomes of \nenvironmental report, such as annual sustainability \nreports and ad-hoc reports. \n8. Conclusion and Outlook \nThe aim of this paper was the design of an\napproach to improve the information quality in IO-\nERIS as a particular type of KMS. In order to achieve nthis, the design science methodology was applied.\nLeveraging the state of the art in academic literature \nand industrial practice, requirements for information \nquality were extracted. Based on these, a two-folded napproach was developed, consisting of meta-\ninformation to be documented and displayed in the \nIO-ERIS, and an incentive scheme to encourage high \nquality information contributions by the participants. \nThe research included a first evaluation in an industry \nworkshop. Future work will include the results from \non on-going user evaluation. Furthermore the transfer \nof the proposed approach to product-related \nenvironmental information will be studied.  \n8.

Some are acted upon immedi-\nately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions -- our implicit "label-\ning" of the world. In this talk I will describe our work using physiological correlates of this labeling to con-\nstruct a hybrid brain-computer interface \(hBCI record electroencephalographic \(EEG part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate \nthe neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective inter-\nest. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using nsemi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to those that are labelled. \nFinally, the system plots an efficient route so that subjects visit similar objects of interest. We show that by \nexploiting the subjects' implicit labeling, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the \nmedian subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that \nthe neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers inference of subjects' \nimplicit labeling. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of ob-\njects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting \nin an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests. \n \nBiographical Sketch: Paul Sajda is Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Radiol-\nogy at Columbia University and Director of the Laboratory for Intelligent Imaging and Neural Computing \n\(LIINC modeling and \nmachine learning applied to image understanding.

I will show recent examples of the use of nonlinear control theory for the assimilation and con-\ntrol of single neuron and network dynamics, a control framework for Parkinson’s disease, and the potential \nfor unification in control of spreading depression and seizures. Lastly, I will discuss why the subtle and \ndeep intersection of symmetry, in brains and models, is important to take into account in this transdisci-\nplinary fusion of computational models of the computational brain with real time control.  \n Biographical Sketch: Steven J.

White \n \nPRESENTATION TITLE:  Are Our Cellular Models Fundamentally Wrong? \n \nAbstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley model, arguably the greatest success story in the history \nof computational neuroscience, is the predecessor of thousands of existing cellular models \nthat span a significant range of levels of detail. Here, using electrophysiological, dynamic-\nclamp, and computational techniques, we demonstrate that many of the “gold standard” \nsingle-cell models, used by thousands of laboratories, fail to account correctly for the responses of well-studied \nexcitatory neurons to noise.  In particular, the input-output gain of entorhinal stellate cells and neocortical py-\nramidal cells is substantially less sensitive to noise than predicted by the models.  The major source of the dis-\ncrepancy is that the models fit measured peri-threshold voltage dynamics poorly.  Because noise is ubiquitous \nand prominent in the brain, and because neuronal gain is crucial for understanding a wide range of response nproperties at the cellular and network levels, we argue that this is an issue of fundamental importance. \n nBiographical Sketch:  John A.

Despite spending as little as 0.01% of their lives having seizures, people \nwith epilepsy take antiepileptic drugs \(AEDs ex-\nperience significant AED related side effects, and approximately 1/3 continue to have seizures. Mapping the \nbrain networks generating seizures is critical for successful epilepsy surgery, therapeutic brain stimulation, \nand seizure forecasting. In focal epilepsy the spontaneous, evoked, and induced brain activity is disrupted \nover a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Multiscale electrophysiology recordings have uncovered a range \nof electrophysiological biomarkers, measurable interictal \(between seizures normal and \npathological tissue that show promise for spatiotemporal mapping of epileptogenic brain. In this talk we \nreview two potential applications of these multiscale biomarkers, epilepsy surgery and seizure forecasting.  \n \n Biographical Sketch:  Greg Worrell, MD, PhD is Chair of Clinical Neurophysiology, Director of Mayo Sys-\ntems Electrophysiology Laboratory \(MSEL prac-\ntice and research are focused on the evaluation and care of patients with medically resistant epilepsy nThrough MSEL he is currently pursuing the integration of large-scale neurophysiology, computing, and im-\naging for biomarker discovery.

Mars program. It would be designed for low mass, lowpower and low temperature operation. The S-band antenna would be a smaller, simpler version of the antenna that flew on Deep Impact. Other antenna options would be available The UHF antennas have been flown on previous Mars lander/rover missions. There would be other alternatives for the S-band antenna and the UHF transceiver on the hub could use a larger power amplifier to talk to an orbiting asset as a backup to the S-band radio  Risk  The highest risk items for telecom would be the single string design for each element and six year design lifetime. However, the S-band radio has flight heritage. The UHF radios would be a new design but do not require new technology. They would be an engineering development 8. SYSTEM SUMMARY Mass Equipment List Table 5 shows a summary of the mass and power for each of the subsystems for the remote instrument units. The mass of one remote unit without the specified instrument is 26.6 kg with contingency specified at the subsystem level based on heritage. Table 6 shows a summary of mass and power by subsystem for the hub. The mass of the hub with contingency is 44.9 kg. Table 7 shows a mass summary for the entire package with appropriate contingencies added per the JPL  s Flight Project Practices and Design Principles Design Principles.

OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS Daytime Operations During the day, the remote units and hub would be fully operational. The remote units would collect data from their instruments as specified by the science team and store it in the controller memory. Table 8 shows the data volume expected from each instrument. After 24 hours have passed the UHF telecom system on the hub is used to poll each of the remote units separately at the designated interval for the stored data. The hub then transmits the data direct-to-Earth using the S-band radio. This requires a maximum of eight hours at 50 kbps each day using the DSN 34 m antennas However, data rates as high as 120 kbps may be achieved reducing the downlink time. The hub has enough memory margin to accumulate data from all the instruments for three Earth days before it must downlink the data Nighttime Operations During nighttime operations, data collection at the remote units would be taking place. The magnetometer and seismometer collect data continuously. However, the seismometer operates at a reduced mode where the sampling rate is reduced to one-half of the daytime rate which has been deemed more than adequate by the science team. The remaining instruments collect data at various intervals that would be conducive to the science team  s current requirements. Telecom events would not be scheduled during the lunar night. The data accumulates in the controller memory over 16 Earth days \(~14 days at an equatorial location would be considered a worse case so two days have been added to be conservative data volume summary for each instrument during a 16 Earth day lunar night. When the sun comes up and the hub and remote units have sufficient power to run the telecom systems the hub polls each remote unit separately at a designated interval similar to operations during the day. The data would then be transmitted to Earth gradually over the next few days using the S-band radio Table 7.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The ALGEP modular design builds upon lessons learned from Apollo era ALSEP package and technology advances since that time. ALGEP meets the requirements of long lifetime survival while maintaining continuous operation of its instruments during the lunar night which can last up to 16 days at equatorial regions on the Moon. The package would be powered using solar arrays and batteries alone not requiring nuclear sources to supply power or maintain thermal control. This concept is feasible due to its lowpower operational mode at night The modular design and packaging scheme provides flexibility in deployment across all regions of the Moon including the farside pending the availability of an orbital communications asset. The relatively light ALGEP package could be accommodated on astronaut activity support vehicles, providing a method to distribute the packages across the Moon, ultimately gaining a Moon-wide understanding of lunar geophysical properties ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the NASA Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities Program The work described in this publication was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration References herein to any specific commercial product process or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
