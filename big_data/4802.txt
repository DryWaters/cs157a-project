IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper  1 189 Version 4 Updated November 29 2007 2 DEVELOPMENT OF CALIBRATION PROCEDURE In this section we describe how the calibration procedure was developed A calibration procedure was first drafted by domain experts who have an extensive experience with the instrument The domain experts mentally reviewed the first draft to catch any logical flaws After a stable draft was drawn the domain experts explained the procedure to us Through several meetings the domain expert 
laid out the purpose of each calibration step and the details of how to do it The draft of the calibration procedure is composed of several calibration steps We tested each step individually to check whether the calibration step generates a desired result At the time of the development a direct control of the instrument parameters with software was not available Therefore we manually controlled the instrument parameters and collected data to analyze The acquired data are used to apply the calibration procedure 1 


One test experiment was to calibrate the PreAmplifier Discriminator PAD Digital-analog converter DAC value and a Channel Electron Multiplier CEM bias voltage In the original procedure the two instrument parameters are simultaneously varied while a filament current is on and the optimal values are those that maximize a signal to noise ratio The ratio is given by the measured ion count at mass of 32 divided by that at mass of 48 We acquired mass spectra for 8 different PAD DAC values and 7 different CEM bias voltages leading to 56 measurements We calculated the signal-to-noise ratios of the mass spectra Figure 1 shows the calculated ratio with respect to the two instrument parameters According to the plot the optimal values for the two instrument values are the PAD DAC value of 1800 DN and the CEM bias of 2200 V The optimal values disagree with those used by instrument engineers It turns out that the way that instrument engineers determine the optimal values is different from the original draft Instead of varying the two instrument parameters at the same time the instrument engineers vary one parameter at a time and optimize it with a different criterion The engineers optimize the PAD DAC value by monitoring a noise level with a filament current off The optimal value should satisfy a nominal value of the noise level which is defined by a range of ion count per channel and per frame After the PAD DAC value was calibrated an optimal value of the CEM bias is found by monitoring a signal level with a filament current on Conceptually the two separate steps can be merged to the original step which effectively does a similar optimization by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio However the result shows that there exists a difference From this exercise we decided to do the two separate steps instead of the merged one 1200 _ 1400 1600 lwo11 Another test experiment involves the optimization of a filament ionizer current The original scheme is to find a current at which the second derivative of the ratio of the ion count at mass of 29 to that at mass of 28 is maximized The rationale behind this scheme is that the ideal current should make the two adjacent mass peaks distinguishable while keeping the mass peaks as high as possible When the ion current is too low the mass peaks are not prominent enough to see from the background noise When the ion current is too high the two adjacent mass peaks merge so that the mass resolution is lost The compromise of the two extremes is desired In principle the second derivative of the ratio should be maximized at the compromising point We acquired mass spectra at several ionizer current values Figure 2 shows the mass spectra for various current values As expected the increase of the ionizer current results in higher mass peaks and eventually the merge of adjacent peaks By observing the data an optimal ionizer current is likely to be around 1.2 A and 1.3 A In comparison we measured the second-derivative of the signal-to-noise ratio to find an optimal current Figure 3 shows the result of the signal-to-noise ratio analysis Surprisingly the optimal current is 1.0 A according to the maximum second derivative scheme showing that the scheme does not work The failure of the scheme is attributed to the extreme sensitivity of the second derivative to the fluctuation of the ion counts in particular at the current where the two mass peaks start to form Mass Spetra with V arious lonlzer Currents 24 26 28 30 32 34 Mass-o-Chag Ratio amu ic 1 05 A ic 110 A ic 1.15 A ic 1.20 A ic=.25 A ic=1.30 A 36 Figure 2 Mass spectra measured at various ionizer current values CEM Bi V Figure 1 Signal mass=32 to noise mass=48 ratio with respect to two instrument parameters PAD DAC value and CEM bias 2 A ic 135 A ic 1.40 A ic=.45 


In order to avoid the sensitivity issue we redesigned the calibration process of the ionizer current We measure the ion count at mass of 28 and the ion count at mass of 28.5 and calculate the ratio of the ion count at mass of 28 to that at mass of 28.5 We call the ratio Q The optimal current is the current below which the ratio Q is larger than one and above which the ratio Q becomes smaller than one When a current is low the ratio is larger than one because of the abundance of nitrogen in the air As the current increases the signal from mass of 29 grows and eventually the mass peak of 28 merges with the mass peak of 29 leading to a larger ion count for mass of 28.5 When the ratio Q is smaller than one the distinction between mass 28 and 29 is lost Therefore an optimal current should be a current at which the ratio Q is larger than one Within the constraint we also want to increase the ion count so that it is easy to observe a small mass peak which otherwise would been hidden in a background noise Therefore the best condition for an optimal current is to find a current at which and below which the ratio Q is larger than one and above which the ratio Q becomes smaller than one Figure 4 shows the ratio Q as a function of the current An optimal current is 1.3 A which agrees with what the instrument engineers find optimal Note that the ratio Q is ill defined at currents below 1.05 A because the ion count of mass 28.5 is zero In the range of currents that the ratio Q is well defined an optimal current can be uniquely determined by checking the current across which the ration Q changes from a number larger than one to a number smaller than one Another calibration step that we iterated and modified many times is a step to determine whether mass peaks are located at expected positions and whether ion trap is contaminated For this step we first obtained a normal mass spectrum with no contamination and characterized the mass spectrum Figure 5 shows a typical normal and clean mass spectrum The spectrum contains air mass peaks such as 28 29 32 40 and 44 along with other smaller peaks We made a list of persistent peaks that appear in the air spectrum without any chemical inputs Initially we checked whether a spectrum contains all the persistent mass peaks and if any peaks are missing we declare that the mass peaks are not at expected locations We soon found out that the criterion is too tough to meet because of the fluctuation of mass resolution and errors in finding mass peaks So we relaxed it a little bit to focus on just top five mass peaks 28,29,32,40,44 and if the peaks are found we declare that the mass peaks are at expected locations frames that contain elution peaks and compare it with a range of frames before the elution peaks and after the elution peaks We look for features that are common in the frames during elution peaks and after elution peaks in contrast to those before elution peaks since the mass spectrum before elution peaks should not contain any contaminant peaks Mass spectra before elution peaks and after elution peaks are compared in Figure 7 The mass spectra after elution peaks have a higher signal at mass 43 and mass 58 hinting that the ion chamber is contaminated due to the previous elution event As time passes after the elution the contaminated mass peak height decreases This pattern suggests that we can utilize the height of the mass peaks that are not in the list of the persistent peaks from the clean spectrum We designed several criteria to determine whether a mass spectrum contains contaminated peaks One criterion is to look at the relative ratio of one of the persistent mass peaks to one of non-persistent mass peaks There are many possible pairs of mass peaks we can use in this case This condition did not work very well because the fluctuation of the ratio of one to another peak varies too much even within the collection of clean mass spectra Instead we divided the mass peaks into two groups one consisting of all mass peaks between mass 40 and mass 50 the other consisting of all mass peaks above mass 50 Within each group we find the largest mass peak The ratio of the largest mass peak height in the first group to that in the second group is used as a condition to determine whether a contaminated peak exists We call the ratio P In the normal clean mass spectrum the largest mass peak in the first group is either mass 40 or mass 44 and the largest mass peak in the second group is either mass 55 56 or 57 The ratio P is usually much larger than 2.0 We slightly reduce the minimum value for the ratio P to be 1.7 in order to reduce a false positive rate of contaminant peak detection We apply one more condition to this process We check whether the largest mass peak in the first mass group is either mass 40 or 44 If that condition is violated other mass peaks in the first mass group are too large Therefore we categorize the spectrum as contaminated one We used the two conditions to detect contaminated spectra among 19 test spectra There was no false negative and no false positive results in the test For the detection of contamination we obtain a few mass spectra with known chemical injections Figure 6 shows the total ion chromatogram obtained by injecting pentane hexane acetone and heptane through a gas chromatogram before the ion trap measurement There are several peaks that correspond to the elution of the chemical compounds From the total ion chromatogram we select a range of 3

3 AUTONOMOUS CALIBRATION PROCEDURE The finalized version of the calibration procedure consists of 1 checking the normality of a measured mass spectrum 2 tuning several instrument parameters 3 recovering errors if they occur and 4 reporting errors when they are not recoverable The tunable instrument parameters are a PreAmplifier Discriminator PAD Digital-analog converter DAC value a Channel Electron Multiplier CEM bias voltage and an ionizer current At each tuning process there is either a recovery path or an exit path when errors occur Figure 8 shows the conditional and sequential flows of the calibration procedure encompassing all possible cases Normality of a Background Noise Level The calibration starts from checking the normality of a background noise level when an ionizer current is off When the current is off there are no excited ions that can contribute to CEM and thus the signal registered in DAC is an electronics noise rather than a signal arising from ions A low level of the background noise is preferred to make sure that one can see the amount of the noise arising from the electronics noise without washing out a true signal A specific condition for the normality of the base background noise level is given by the maximum number of ion counts per second frame and by the maximum number of ion counts per channel after adding up the ion counts from all the frames Tuning PAD DAC Value When the normality of the base background noise level is not met we take a path to tune a PAD DAC value The DAC value controls the threshold of the signal registered to a signal processing electronics As the PAD DAC value increases the threshold of the registration of the signal increases Therefore if the background noise level is too high we increase the PAD DAC value until it meets the nominal condition of the background noise Conversely we lower the PAD DAC value if the noise is too low Normality of a Signal Level After the normal background noise level is achieved the next step is to check the normality of a signal level while a filament current is on Generally the signal should be strong enough to see most of important mass peaks of air such as mass peaks of 28 N2 32 02 40 Ar and 44 CO2 Since the signal is given as a function of channel number the conversion of channel number to mass number in amu is required We call this procedure mass calibration The mass calibration involves a complex data analysis procedure and deserves a separate paper by itself In this paper we assume that the mass calibration is done reasonably well so that the error in mass calibration is less than 0.5 amu The normality of the signal level is given by the minimum total ion counts per second frame and the minimum number of total ion counts for mass  31.5 32.5 This condition ensures that an overall signal level is high and the largest air peak usually 32 has a strong signal Tuning CEMBias Voltage When the normality of the signal level is not satisfied we take a recovery path that is to tune a CEM bias voltage The CEM voltage controls the amplification of the signal of ion counts A higher voltage leads to a higher amplification of the signal When a CEM is used a lot a CEM slowly degrades and its amplification gain becomes weaker so that a higher voltage is need to make the same amplification than before When the signal level does not meet its nominal condition it is usually due to the degradation of the CEM's amplification ability In the case we increase a CEM voltage until the signal nominal condition is met If the condition is not met even at the maximum allowed CEM voltage we use a back-up CEM A CEM is paired with its own PAD Therefore when a back-up CEM is used we restart an autonomous calibration procedure and tune a PAD DAC value if necessary If even the back-up CEM cannot meet the nominal condition an error is reported and a calibration procedure exits Tuning Ionizer Current After a normal signal level is achieved the next step is to tune an ionizer current The ionizer current affects a signalto-noise ratio As the current increases the spectrometer generates more ions and thus higher ion counts Initially the increased current improves the signal-to-noise ratio but a further increase of the current gives rise to a merge of two adjacent mass peaks making a poor mass resolution It is finding the transition point that is the goal of tuning the ionizer current We find the optimal current by looking for an ionizer current below which the peaks of mass 28 and mass 29 have not yet completely merged and above which the two peaks have completely merged This scheme emphasizes the gain of a high signal over the gain of a high mass resolution The optimal current found by this scheme does not give the best mass resolution because the two mass peaks 28 and 29 already started to merge but it gives a high signal value by losing the mass resolution slightly The reason to choose the mass peak 28 and 29 is because the mass 28 and 29 peaks are the strongest mass peaks among the pairs of adjacent mass peaks Sanity Check of Mass Spectrum After tuning all the three instrument parameters we do a sanity check by measuring a mass spectrum and checking whether expected mass peaks are observed at the right masses and whether unexpected mass peaks are observed The location of the expected mass peaks tells us whether the RF amplitude is ramped up as expected When the expected mass peaks are missing an error is declared and the verification of the RF sequence parameters is requested 6 


When all the expected mass peaks are observed we check whether unexpected mass peaks are shown above a certain peak signal threshold Any unexpected peak with a high signal indicates that an ion trap is contaminated by either previous chemical events or chemical leakages In this situation a procedure of cleaning the ion trap is requested 4 TRANSLATION TO FLIGHT SOFTWARE In this section we describe how we translate the autonomous calibration procedure into flight software We map each calibration step of the procedure into a calibration function and a decision variable that contains the decision result of the calibration function The decision variables are accessible to the command and data-handling C&DH module of the flight software Depending on the value of the decision variables C&DH module determines a next step in the autonomous calibration The calibration function analyzes measured data to determine a value to the decision variables There are 8 top-level calibration functions that directly communicate with the C&DH module Depending on the calibration result the functions set the decision variables to TRUE or FALSE The function itself does not return any value the output is void All the calibration functions are prefixed with ac and all the decision variables are prefixed with AC in order to avoid symbol name clashes with the other part of the flight software acInitialize This function initializes all the decision variables of the calibration procedure It must be called before any other calibration routines are called This ensures that all the decisions variables are set to default so that a new calibration process is not affected by the previous calibration result acCheckBackground This function checks the base background signal level of a mass spectrum when the filament current is off It checks whether the nominal condition of the background signal level is met The condition is that 1 the total ion count of each channel should be less than or equal to AC_MAX BACKGROUND ION COUNTS PER CHA NNEL and 2 the total ion count of each frame should be larger than AC MIN BACKGROUND ION_COUNTS_PER_FRAM E and less than or equal to AC_MAX BACKGROUND ION COUNTS PER FRA ME When the condition is satisfied it sets the decision variable AC BACKGROUND-NORMAL to TRUE Otherwise it sets AC_BACKGROUND_NORMAL to FALSE acOptimizePAD This function finds an optimal PAD DAC value based on ion count signal The function receives several mass spectra from a range of PAD DAC values and uses acCheckBackground function to find which PAD DAC value generates a mass spectrum that satisfies the base background nominal condition If there are more than one PAD DAC value that satisfies the condition it chooses the lowest PAD DAC value among them The decision variable of this function is AC PAD OPTIMIZED If the function successfully finds the optimal condition AC_PAD_OPTIMIZED is set to TRUE Otherwise it is set to FALSE The output variable is the optimal PAD value found When the optimization is successful the flight software should update the PAD DAC value with the optimal PAD value before proceeding acCheckSignal This function checks the signal level generated when a filament current is on The condition for a nominal signal is that 1 the averaged total ion count per frame should be equal to or larger than AC MIN-TOTAL ION-COUNTS PER FRAME and 2 the averaged total ion count for m 31.5,32.5 should be equal to or larger than AC MIN TOTAL_ION_COUNTS_M_32_PER_FRAME The decision result is stored in AC SIGNAL-NORMAL When the nominal signal condition is met AC SIGNAL-NORMAL is set to TRUE Otherwise it is FALSE acOptimizeCEM This function finds an optimal CEM bias based on the ion count signal given The optimal CEM value increases the total ion count by less than 10 compared to the total ion count of a previous lower CEM bias The function also checks whether the mass spectrum of the optimal CEM bias satisfies the nominal signal condition given by acCheckSignal function If the optimal CEM bias is found and it satisfies the nominal signal condition it sets the decision variable AC CEM OPTIMIZED to TRUE Otherwise it is FALSE When AC CEM_OPTIMIZED is TRUE the fight software should update the CEM bias to the optimal value before proceeding acOptim izeIonizerCurrent This function finds an optimal ionizer current by looking for an ionizer current below which the peaks 28 and 29 have not yet completely merged and above which the two peaks have completely merged This scheme emphasizes a high signal over a high mass resolution The optimal current found by this scheme does not give the best mass resolution because the two peaks 28 and 29 already started to merge but it gives a high signal value by losing the mass resolution slightly The decision variable of the function is AC_CURRENT_OPTIMIZED When an optimal current is found AC_CURRENT_OPTIMIZED is set to TRUE 7 


Otherwise it is FALSE When AC CURRENT-OPTIMIZED is true the flight software should update the ionizer current value with the optimal current value output variable found before proceeding acMassCalibration This function performs a mass calibration based on a given mass spectrum where the two largest mass peaks are nitrogen and oxygen peaks and independently performs another mass calibration based on RF ramp parameters given by FPGA register values The function compares the results of the two mass calibration methods to determine whether the mass calibration is successful or not The decision variable of this function is AC_MASS CALIBRATED If the two calibration results agree AC MASS-CALIBRATED is set to TRUE Otherwise it is FALSE acCheckMassPeaks This function finds prominent mass peaks in a given mass spectrum and compares them with the persistent mass list The function checks whether the prominent mass peaks do align with the locations of the persistent mass peaks and whether any of the prominent mass peaks are outside of the persistent peak list The decision variables of this function are AC MASS PEAKS CHECKED AC_MASS_PEAKS_AT_EXPECTED_LOCATION and AC FOUND CONTAMINANT MASS PEAKS When the analysis of mass peak locations and strengths is properly conducted AC MASS PEAKS-CHECKED is set to TRUE Otherwise it is FALSE When AC MASS PEAKS CHECKED is true the flight software should use the two other decision variables to determine the next steps of the calibration procedure When AC MASS PEAKS CHECKED is false the flight software should exit the calibration procedure with an error flag 5 CONCLUSIONS In conclusion we have developed a heuristic calibration process to obtain the desired mass resolution and dynamic range of the VCAM s mass spectrometer and have implemented it into flight software We developed the calibration process by working closely with instrument engineers and translated it into algorithms that are suitable for direct conversion to flight software We designed several test cases and datasets to verify that the algorithm achieved the same as the original human calibration process REFERENCES 1 A Chutjian et al Overview of the Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor a Miniature Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer for Trace Contamination Monitoring on the ISS and CEV Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Environmental Systems SAE Technical Paper Series paper number 2007-01-3150 2007 2 D L Jan Environmental Monitoring Instruments Using ISS as a Testbed for Exploration Proceedings of the 2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference Big Sky Montana March 2007 3 R E March An Introduction to Quadrupole Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry Journal of the American Society of Mass Spectrometry Vol 32 351-369 1997 BIOGRAPHY Seungwon Lee is a senior member of the High Capability Computing and Modeling Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory She is developingflight instrument software for Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor data analysis and autonomous calibration She is also conducting research on materials modeling and simulation comet gas dynamics nonlinear dynamics control spectral retrieval data reduction global optimization parallel computing and advanced numerical algorithms She received her Ph.D in Physics from the Ohio State University and her M.S and B.S in Physicsfrom the Seoul National University Ben Bornstein is a senior member of the Machine Learning and Instrument Autonomy group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena CA He is the lead engineer for VCAM data analysis and its flight software implementation Ben enjoys bringing machine learning techniques and considerable hacking programming skills to bear to solve problems in geology remote sensing bioinformatics and systems biology He has designed and implemented software systems for several Caltech biology labs the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics IGB at UC Irvine USC Children's Hospital and JPL's Mars Exploration Rover MER project He is also the inventor of and lead developer for LIBSBML an open-source library for the Systems Biology Markup Language SBML Ben received a B.Sc in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota Duluth in 1999 and is pursuing a MSc in Computer Science at the University of Southern California 8 


time, more firms \(or supply chains\ay start realizing competitive advantages emanating from B2B technology. This could increase mimetic influences and coercive influences over the long run  In addition, the importance of normative pressures in the Thai business community can be accelerated by the strong interdependency between members within the Thai social network. Thailand is known as an interdependence orientation society or a collectivist society h e T h ai com m u n ity  values the spirit of community collaboration. Komin  ref e rs to th is as in terdepen d en ce orien tated T h ai society. Collaborative behaviour is a dominant behavioural pattern, particularly in the rural community, where the brotherhood spirit often manifests itself in helping one another and in being interdependent and mutually supportive. Hence, the findings on the importance of normative pressures are in-accord with previous research dicatin g  that norms espoused by the businesses environment play a major role in influencing organisations to adopt and utilise new technology. Interestingly, both of the previous studies were conducted in the Asian cultural context, namely Singa d C h in a  h ere collectiv is m s eem s to be a s t ron g cu ltu ral value  Overall, findings show that external institutional factors, normative and coercive pressures, have an impact on the B2B utilization, while only normative pressures had a significant influence on perceived performance of B2B technology. Similar to normative pressures seem to be the most significant factor influencing both utilisation and performance Both of the control factors, namely type of Internet access and level of IT related skills and experience of staff, did not have a significant influence in the model. This can also confirm the belief that the basic technical infrastructures such as telecommunications hardware and software are no longer a major problem in the adoption and diffusion of the internet-based B2B technology in Thailand  7. Limitation and Future research Since this study was conducted in Thailand, it may limit the generalizability of our results beyond the Thai cultural context. Eventhough there are similarities among several Thai cultural values and other Asian countries, one cannot confidently assume that the results will be applicable to all Asian countries. Moreover, our findings may also have limited applicability beyond the tourism industry Another limitation is that subjects of this study were representatives of the sub-population of firms that already had some \(often limited\xperience in adopting and utilising e-mail and e-marketplace technologies. These firms tend to have higher technological readiness than non-adopters. However within our scope of study, it can be argued that the researchers may have difficulty in obtaining useful information from the non-adopters as they have no experience in using B2B technology  Future research in this domain can be extended in a number of ways. A duplication of this study can be done using a larger sample size, a variety of industrial contexts and a variety of countries particularly in western contexts characterized by individualism rather than collectivism. This will help strengthen the validity of this research. A better understanding of such isomorphic pressures may well lead to an improvement in B2B technology adoption utilisation, and performance  8. References 1 R.

I r Z  Figure 9 A Military Modeling and Simulation Configuration of the Ilium Framework To do that we have assembled a collection of trusted military simulations that span the range of such applications from fine-grained simulations that focus on detailed interactions between two entities to coarse-grained simulations of military campaigns Figure 9 illustrates the Ilium Framework configured to accommodate those simulations as well as representative prototype systems In this case the legacy applications are simulations analysis systems and design tools Prototypes are notional UAV autopilots route planners decision support systems and similar applications The Framework augments these applications with control objects and agents that coordinate computations in the composed system and specialize agents that typically represent the characteristics of a new system or technology that cannot be easily or adequately simulated in any of the component legacy systems In our current study the following systems have Ilium Framework plugins and are used as components in the study environment 12 Al f<cOmmi.ain FIa 1A  


THUNDER is a campaign simulation that models national military forces and military operations that extend over months 30  Characteristics of individual systems are evaluated statistically and their effects on the overall campaign are not explicitly known Political social and cultural objects and concepts are not included in the model In this configuration THUNDER is used to generate force level tasking mission orders and to evaluate and adjust for the results of missions with respect to campaign plans SEAS is a force level simulation that simulates battles between major forces in combat operations that typically last for hours and as much as a day SEAS features a flexible rules based decision logic that can influence behavior at both the commander and individual combatant level SEAS executes the missions requested by THUNDER and provides a manageable dynamic context for examining the behavior of prototypes in a range of typical operational situations  31 A dynamic plug-in supports interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components EADSIM is a trusted model of air defense systems that is in particular sensitive to many important design attributes of individual systems In certain modified forms it can reference advanced sensor and engagement decision models In our study configuration EADSIM simulates enemy air defenses in selected e.g significant to our investigation portions of the virtual battle A dynamic plug-in supports system control as well as interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components A prototype aircraft mission planning system plug-in supports virtual real time mission plan creation and updates In particular the system provides automatic route planning for selected platforms that have been assigned missions by THUNDER and that are subsequently executed in simulation in SEAS and EADSIM The Ilium Framework itself provides software agents that are used to model notional or experimental UAV characteristics and behaviors Depending on the objectives of a particular study the Framework may also provide agents that address advanced Command and Control concepts to coordinate the interaction of the various component systems We maintain a semantic consistency among the plugged-in component applications by developing a single operational scenario as initial input for a study and deriving the necessary application configuration data from that source We create an RDF model of the scenario based on the Ilium suite of ontologies that includes political context issues objectives sensitivities etc military context centers of gravity campaign objectives etc geophysical environment military units order of battle unit equipment lists etc command and control assets platforms weapons ISR systems etc Figure 11 below is an excerpt from an operational scenario set in the Southwest U.S depicting a description of an Air Force Wing assigned to a notional Joint Task Force The Wing is based at Bishop Air Base and has six Fighter Squadrons assigned to it Additional detail about each of those squadrons as well as the base is found in the model in this case an rdf:resource  associated with it morg:AirForceWing rdf:ID="USAF_366 Air_Exp Wg dc:creator>Doug Holmes</dc:creator mgeo:basedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB geo:positionedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB_pos morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 390_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_494_Ftr_Sq dc date I 0/20/07</dc date morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_496 Ftr_Sq rdfs:comment>366 AEW F-22 F-15 KC-135 130]</rdfs:comment morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 389_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 391 Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 495_Ftr_Sq rdfs:label>366 Air Expeditionary Wing</rdfs:label morg:AirForceWing ab9 7P.b ii uI1 L L CFigure 11 An RDF model of a notional USAF Wing Figure 12 is another excerpt from the same scenario illustrating a model of a particular Fighter Squadron and one of the F-15E aircraft it operates Figure 10 Legacy Components in the Ilium Framework 13 suka

aircraft Note that these models also have associated SEAS models that contain information peculiar to the SEAS simulation about these entities This information is used to configure SEAS to properly represent these particular entities We are also able to insert objects and information that may be of interest in our study that is not represented in any of the component simulations or other applications Where those objects are related to an object that is simulated that relationship permits inferences about the effects on them as a result of actions that are computed in a simulation For example it is possible to indicate that GeorgeAB defends the capital city and lend special significance to the actions of aircraft that are based there even though none of the simulations in the composite system have any notion of capital city Finally the operational scenario provides an explicit record of the assumptions that underly the study and can also include and explicit representation of system and study goals This practice improves analysis and may enable future knowledge based analytical tools Throughout the process of constructing the operational scenario and when it is complete we use one or more Description Logic Reasoners to ensure the logical consistency of the the model A number of these automatic theorem provers are freely available including Pellet 32 33 FaCT  34 and OWLIM 35 are used in the Framework to compute logical entailments and to complete RDF models as well as to ensure the consistency of models In the later capacity frequent checks will identify errors in the construction some e.g Pellet also indicate the source of the error and aid in repairing it As a result we are confident that the operational scenario is a sound model The primary use of the Reasoners allows us to significantly extend the explicit RDF model that is created For example a squadron is explicitly specified as assignedTo a wing and that relationship is the inverse of assignedOrg then the system can infer that the wing has the squadron as an assigned organization even though that fact has never been asserted Similarly if the same relationship is defined as a transitive relationship it is possible to infer that a flight that is assigned to the squadron is also assigned to the wing Once we have an operational scenario that has been classified by a Reasoner we then use the completed model to configure the composite system Ilium and the pluggedin systems to execute the simulation We use SPARQL a W3C standard query language designed to access RDFL to extract data from the scenario to create the input files needed to configure the various applications.[36 SELECT name pos long lat alt vis W1HLERE name rdf:type mast SeasLocation name geo:positionedAt pos pos pos:long long pos pos:lat lat pos pos:alt alt name msim:Visible vis  Figure 13 A typical SPARQL query In a similar fashion SPARQL is used to extract data from the scenario to create the necessary Ilium java surrogate control and agents SPARQL can also be used to review the scenario and answer questions that have arisen since the inception of the study At this point we are able execute the scenario with confidence that it will produce reliable results 7 CONCLUSIONS We have developed a methodology and supporting tools for creating an operational scenario that supports the semantic interoperability of an ad hoc collection of legacy applications and extends their capabilities The method depends on and ensures the logical integrity of the composite system Therefore when we assemble as a collection of legacy component systems that were not originally intended to interoperate with other systems we can be confidant that the composite system will produce consistent results Logical consistency implies that to the degree that we trust the interpretation underlying the model the results of operations on the model are trustworthy If for example the model is based on a Newtonian interpretation of physics the model ought to provide reliable answers to questions about automotive and even aeronautical engineering but probably not to all questions in astronomy or cosmology This methodology extends the utility of trusted simulations allowing integration of finegrained simulations that are sensitive to design requirements with high level coarse-grained simulations that are sensitive to acquisition issues and policy The potential benefits of 14 


this sort of interoperation may range from obvious production efficiencies to clearer insights into system requirements Finally an important side-effect of the approach is the OWL/RDF knowledge base formed by the combination of the operational scenario and the results of the operations of the legacy systems That knowledge base and the use of SPARQL queries and SWRL rules effectively expands the functionality of the system and greatly improves the analysis of the output of the system of cooperating simulations and tools We have prepared a foundation for the application of Semantic Web and other knowledge based tools in the analysis and design of unmanned systems We anticipate the development and application of these tools and the addition of autonomy directed Multiple Agent Systems MAS that use RDF/XML inter-agent communications in the coming year REFERENCES 1 NAFCAM 2001 Exploiting EManufacturing:Ineroperability of Software Systems Used by U.S Manufacturers available at 12 Protege Ontology Editor documentation available at http proteae.stanf6rd.edu 13 Top Braid Composer Datasheet available at 14 W and Nicola Guarino 2001 Support for Ontological Analysis of Taxonomic Relationships J Data and Knowled 39\(1 October 2001 15 Natalya F Noy and Deborah L McGuinness Ontology Development 10 1 A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology  Stanford University Stanford CA 94305 16 Alan Rector Modularisation of Domain Ontologies Implemented in Description Logics and related formalisms including OWL K-CAP'03 October 23-25 2003 Sanibel Island Florida USA pp 121-8 2003 17 Cyc Homepage available at htc.c 18 Open Cyc home page available at 19 SUMO Description and Home Page available at 19 SENSUS Description and Home Page available at 2 Bemers-Lee Tim Hendler Jim Lasilla Ora The Semantic Web Scientific American available at 20 DOLCE A Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering ontology and documents available at 3 Bemers-Lee Tim Blog on Design Issues available at 4 RDF Primer available at s chema/#ref-rdf-primer 5 Lacey Lee OWL Representing Information Using the Web Ontology Language Trafford Publishing 2005 6 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at Jten pHomewPage availal adt 7 Jena Home Page available at 8 Protege Home Page available at h1ttp  protegest nftanford.edu,X 1 9 Baader Calvanese McGuiness Nardi and PatelSchnieder Description Logic Handbook 10 Oberle Daniel Semantic Management of Middleware Springer 2006 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at 21 Nicola Gauarino Claudio Masolo Stefano Borgo Aldo Gangemi and Alessandro Oltramari Ontology Infrastructure for the Semantic Web Wonder World Deliverable DI 8 Laboratory for Applied Ontology Trento Italy 2001 available on line at ht X1t1 22 DUL.owl ontology available at www.1oa23t og DLl 23 Amy Knutilla Steven Polyak Craig Schlenoff Austin Tate Shu Chiun Cheah Steven Ray and Richard Anderson Process Specification Language An Analysis of Existing Representations NIST report available at http llwww.mel.nlist.gov/msid.librarZ/d.oc/psl-1 _.df 24 Process Specification Language Ontology available at http-//www,55,me l.nit gov/psl 25 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 owl ontology available at ok i.cae.drexel.edu./-wbs/onltology/2004/09/ogc-gmI1 26 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 of Open GIS Consortium OGC Home Page available at 15

 17 Chris Burton received an Associate degree in electronic systems technology from the Community College of the Air force in 1984 and a BS in Electrical Engineering Technology from Northeastern University in 1983.  Prior to coming to the Georgia Institute of Technology \(GTRI\ in 2003, Chris was a BMEWS Radar hardware manager for the US Air Force and at MITRE and Xontech he was responsible for radar performance analysis of PAVE PAWS, BMEWS and PARCS UHF radar systems Chris is an accomplished radar-systems analyst familiar with all hardware and software aspects of missile-tracking radar systems with special expertise related to radar cueing/acquisition/tracking for ballistic missile defense ionospheric effects on UHF radar calibration and track accuracy, radar-to-radar handover, and the effects of enhanced PRF on radar tracking accuracy.  At GTRI, Chris is responsible for detailed analysis of ground-test and flight-test data and can be credited with improving radar calibration, energy management, track management, and atmospheric-effects compensation of Ballistic Missile Defense System radars   Paul D. Burns received his Bachelor of Science and Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering at Auburn University in 1992 and 1995 respectively. His Master\222s thesis research explored the utilization of cyclostationary statistics for performing phased array blind adaptive beamforming From 1995 to 2000 he was employed at Dynetics, Inc where he performed research and analysis in a wide variety of military radar applications, from air-to-air and air-toground pulse Doppler radar to large-scale, high power aperture ground based phased array radar, including in electronic attack and protection measures. Subsequently, he spent 3 years at MagnaCom, Inc, where he engaged in ballistic missile defense system simulation development and system-level studies for the Ground-based Midcourse defense \(GMD\ system. He joined GTRI in 2003, where he has performed target tracking algorithm research for BMD radar and supplied expertise in radar signal and data processing for the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy Integrated Warfare Systems 2.0 office.  Mr. Burns has written a number of papers in spatio-temporal signal processing, sensor registration and target tracking, and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the Georgia Institute of Technology  


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds.
