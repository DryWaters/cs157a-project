2005 7th International Conference on Information Fusion FUSION Multi-Hypotheses Tracking Algorithm Based on the Belief Theory Benjamin Mourllion Dominique Gruyer Cyril Royere Sdbastien Theroude LIVIC INRETS  LCPC Bat.824 14 route de la Miniere 78000 Versailles Satory France benjamin.mourllion@lcpc.fr AbstractThe aim of this paper is to enhance the research works developed since 1998 by Gruyer and Royere They established a tool for detections of vehicles and tracking based on the belief theory Their approaches focus 
on the use of generalized Dempster's combination rules in the extended open world and they provide two partial views of the situation with two belief matrices The first one represents the belief that targets are associated with tracks and the second one represents the belief that tracks are associated with targets To take the final decision they used the Hungarian algorithm which gives the better associations between targets and tracks according to the criteria of maximal global belief But this global association 
can lead to some suspicious local associations This paper provides a solution in order to avoid theses disturbances with the development of a new MiT algorithm based on belief theory Index Termns-Belief Theory Dempster's Combination Rule Vehicle Detection Vehicle Tracking MHT I INTRODUCTION Target tracking is strongly used in robotic field Main applications are the monitoring of the airspace and target control for military purpose More recently this technique was considerably developed in the field of intelligent 
vehicles In this topic we can quote the books of Bar-Shalom 3 4 and of Blackman and Popoli 5 as reference works Closer to the problems relating to the intelligent vehicles various other works 8 12 are based on the same traditional algorithms and were improved in order to answer to certain constraints The LIVIC Interactions VehicleInfrastructure-Drivers research Laboratory develops and uses tracking algorithms based on the belief theory using the Transferable Belief Model TMB 13 Other 
target tracking works are done using an other model of the belief theory 16 Theses tracking algorithms enhance the perception of objects on the road Thus behaviours of surrounding vehicles are analyzed and troubles or anomalies are detected Therefore safety of humans is increased To carry out target tracking the system must be able to realize two steps The first stage is the state vectors prediction of known objects from the time k-I to the time k at the 
time k Usually this prediction step is achieved by the use of a Kalman filter We call the result of this Appearance of an Object  a2 i aa.a ta I I I.S 5 5 Igg0 iSiE  Disappearance of 
an Object Fig 1 Association step detected objects X are associated with the predicted known objects Y In intelligent vehicle applications this step has to manage objects appearance and disappearance prediction the tracks Then sensors provide some new data With these 
data the system extracts the perceived objects called the targets The second stage association step figure 1 consists in establishing a correlation between the tracks and the targets It arises that the traditional methods of association for the tracking support either the tracks PDAF and JPDAF do not manage targets appearances or the targets MHT2 generates virtual targets In addition it appears that few systems only manage the detection of appearance and/or disappearance of tracks The method suggested 
in 6 and 7 proposes a global framework for association tracking and appearance/disappearance management In spite of its good performances several remarks can be made with regard to this system Not all the available information is used in particular the conflict Moreover this system is imperatively looking to associate all tracks Yj with all targets Xi with 1\(J Joint Probability Data Association Filter 2MHT Multi Hypotheses Tracking 0-7803-9286-8/05/$20.00 2512005 IEEE 922 


maximizing the total belief of the global final association Unfortunately this association can lead to disputable local associations After having introduced our notations we present the specialized sources and we introduce the actual framework developed in 6 and 7 and show its limits through an example Secondly we provide a solution using a MHT algorithm based on two different approaches II NOTATIONS A Mass Expression To express the mass on the hypothesis Xi is in relation with Yj Smets proposes the following notation ml'{Xi}\(Yj where e is the frame of discernement This strict notation is unfortunately syntactically quite heavy In order to light it we propose to write instead of mO XX  Yj1 mt,j Hj  Moreover when we combine several sources an advantage of this second notation appears The syntax allows to know where the mass is resulting from Example let us consider two sources The first one gives a bba about the relation Xi in relation with Yj mn,j\(Hj the second one about the relation Xi is not in relation with Yk mi,k\(Hk After combination we obtain a mass mi,jk\(Hj and we know that it result from j and k If we consider m sources the resulting mass after all the combinations is noted mi Hj The dot means all B Unions of Hypotheses Expression By roughly speaking we note a multi-hypothesis Hj U Hk instead of Hj 5Hk III GENERATION OF THE SPECIALIZED SOURCES From an index of agreement Iij between a target Xi and a track Yj a basic belief assignment bba is computed based on the following postulate A source of information does not have the right to say at the same time a target is associated to a track and is not associated to this track The main interest of this model is to eliminate the intrinsic conflict Thus if several concordant sources are combinated the generated conflict is limited In figure 2 two distributions of mass expressing the principle of this postulate are given As we can see a source can not give mass on Hj and on Hj Hj is the hypothesis that Xi is associated with Yj The bba is defined using two functions I1 for 0 Ti and 42 for r2 1 The definition of these specialized distributions of mass is given by formula 1 0 T I ICU o T1 t2 I ICU Fig 2 Example of two bba in agreement with themselves For a given ci,j  the source can not allow a non-null mass on Hj and on Hj in the same time mi,j\(Hj  0 b1\(Ic,j Ici mig H _ 1\2752 Ic,i  Icij 0 cij 1 J2\(Icij Icij mz,j H  1 Ici 1 141\(icij lci c 0,T21 C T2m1 c 07,T C 7i1,1 c O,ml G 71,72 C 72T1 1 The definition of the specialized sources proposed by Smets 14 and Appriou 2 can also be tuned by another coefficient coefficient of weakening The application processed in this article considers that this coefficient noted ao corresponds to the reliability of the sensor providing the targets Thus the formula 1 must respect the following limit cases conditions I,ij 0 I2\(0 aO Icij  Tl 12\(Tl 0 260 cij  T2 1\(T2 0 260 cij 1 1i\(O  a0 2 The first mass set example of the figure 2 is in fact a particular case of the second with rT i r2  or In this case r varies between 0 and 1  When the index r is fixed at 0.5 the system is in a neutral impartial case at the time of the modelling of the distribution of mass  When this index is lower than 0.5 then modelling is said as optimist because the model tends to allot mass on Hj for a low value of 1cij  When the index r is higher than 0.5 then modelling is known as pessimist because an high index cij is need to allot mass on the Hj hypothesis In our application since all targets X are turned over by the same sensor we consider only one value of r for all the distributions and ao is the same one for all the distributions 923

1 Cascade Method The k-level hypotheses are all the disjunctions of k singleton hypotheses We notice that the masses are normalized we lose the conflict information From the highest level Q while all the k-level hypotheses are less than 0.5 the algorithm spreads pignisticly the mass of the k-level hypotheses on the k 1 hypotheses and so on When the mass of a k-level hypothesis is greater than 0.5 the algorithm propagates the k singleton hypotheses which compose the k-level hypothesis Let us consider the following example We consider E H1 H2  Hi means the target X is in relation with the track Yj and  means X is a new object After combinaison formula 5 and normalization we obtain m\(Hi m\(H2 m  340 0 0 m\(Hi U H2 m\(Hi U  m\(H2 U  m\(Hi U H2 U  0 450 0 210 k-level pignistic hypotheses repartition H_ 0.340 0.340 0.635 1 H2 0 0 0.070 __ ______ 0 0 0.295 H1UH2 0 0.070 0 2 H1U 0.450 0.520 0 H2U 0 0.070 0 3 i HUH2 U  bO.21011 0 0 1 The algorithm starts at the level 3 0.210  0.5 so the mass is distributed on the 2-level hypotheses Since the mass on the hypothesis H1 U  equals 0.520  0.5 hypotheses H1 and  will be propagated To know the proportion of each hypothesis the algorithm finishes the pignistic repartition until the level 1 It can happen that masses are always lower than 0.5 Let us consider this new example Im\(Hi rM\(H2 m 2488 2488 0 m\(Hi U H2 m\(Hi U  m\(H2 U  m\(Hl U H2 U  2861 0 0 2163  k-level pignistic hypotheses  repartition H1 _0.488_ 0.2488  0.4639  1  H2 0.2488 0.2488 0.4639 l ___*__ 0 1 0 10.0721 __HI U_H2 _ 0.2861 0.3582 0 2 I 1U 0 0.0721 0 ___H2U*_ I 0 0.0721 0 3 IHiUH2U I0.2163 0  0 In this case the algorithm can not take any decision So it runs a reversed pignistic repartion With the initial bba the algorithm spread the mass of the level k on the level k  1 k-level 1 pignistic hypotheses  repartition Hi 0.2488 0 0 1 0.2488 0 0 721  f O X 0 0 0  I H1UH2 0.2861 0.5349 0 2 HH1 U 0 0.1244 0 H2U  0 0.1244 0 3 H1 U H2 U  0.2163 0.2163 j 1.000 It appears that the hypotheses to be propagated are Hi and H2 Remark In this example only one target was considerated Assuming n targets are detected we must applied n times this algorithm 2 Threshold Method The threshold method is a less complex algorithm From the two pignistic matrices we compute a weighted threshold s with k8 the weight 9 Then the system keeps only the association with a pignistic probability greater than the threshold As we see in figure 7 the number of validated hypotheses is function of the value of k If 0.5  ks  1 the maximal number of validated hypotheses is 1 If we want a more careful system we have to validate more hypotheses Thus the lower is k5 the bigger is the number of validated hypotheses If k8  0 at least one hypothesis is validated and at the most all hypotheses are validated We notice that the value ks  0.5 is a particular case Indeed in this case s represents the half of the non-conflict pignistic probability So only one association can verify the inequality P H  s 3 Balance Sheet Method J Cascade Threshold Complexity High Low Number of Generated InI Tracks Accurate Inaccurate Conflict Integration No Yes B Decision and New Frame of Discernment At the opposite of previously presented method the system tolerates now that some tracks and/or targets are not associated For the threshold method if the conflict is too important we prefer not to make a decision rather to make an error In addition the system can associate a target with different tracks Xi can be associated with Yj and Yk It leads to a new frame of discernement with the following virtuar targets Yj and Yi It is important to underline the fact that this frame is still exhaustive and hypotheses are still exclusive 927 s  k I P\(O

Related work and conclusion Mining sequential patterns has been extensively studied in data mining community since the first research work in [1]. The earlier studies which focused on the large size of retail datasets have developed several Apriorilike algorithms in order to solve the problem of discovering sequential patterns from such databases However, the Apriori-like algorithms only perform well in databases consisting of short frequent sequences [17 This is caused by the fact that it is quite time-consuming to generate nTerms sequences candidates from \(n1 disadvantage of Apriori-like algorithms [1], a variety of algorithms such as PrefixSpan [17], SPADE [25 SLPMiner [22] and GST [12] have been proposed. In order to improve the efficiency, each algorithm pursues a different method of discovering frequent sequential patterns, which makes them featured by the capability of mining such patterns without even generating any candidates With respect to the representation of the content of documents, some research works have used phrases rather than individual words [21]. However, the effectiveness of the text mining systems was not improved very much. The likely reason is that, a phrasebased method has  lower consistency of assignment and lower document frequency for terms  21]. Hence, in this paper, we present a novel concept for mining text documents for sequential patterns. Instead of using single words, we use pattern-based taxonomy to represent documents. By pruning meaningless patterns which have been proven to be the source of the  noise   in this study, the problem of  overfitting  is solved and the experimental results which show the encouraging outcomes are achieved 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recall Pr e c is

  12  Figure 32 Bottom view of dual frequency antenna tile with perforated L-band patc h in lower layer with Kuband patches  Figure 33 Layer stack with perforated L-band patch in lower layer with Ku-band patches  8  B EAM FORMING N ETWORK  A major keystone for the su ccess of phased array antenna onboard aircraft is the capability of steering the main beam in the direction of the geosta tionary satellites. This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
