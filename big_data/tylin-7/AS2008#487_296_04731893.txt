  The Logic Properties of Association Rules and its application  Bo Liu School of Educational Information and Technology, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631 E-MAIL: gavinliuli@126.com   Abstract In this paper it firstly attends to the theoretical foundations of data mining technologies, especially the association rules discovering. Several classes of association rules are defined such as transitive quantifiers, double trans itive quantifiers and founded-equivalent tr ansitive quantifiers, e.t. and discussed these properties of some 4ft quantifiers Then based on the procedure 4ft-Miner some experiments was turn out and the flexible result was excellent. In the later give their relationship among them and the future works about this problem  1  Introduction  The rapidly growing vo lume and complexity of modern data makes the need for technologies to describe and distill the in formation which contain increasingly important content for us  In this paper we will contribu te to the theoretical foundations of data mining, especially dealing with association rules. We are not interested in çclassical association rules of the form X 002 Y where X and Y are sets of items, here the intuitive meaning of the rule X  002 Y is that transactions \(e.g. supermarket baskets containing set X  of items tend to contain set Y  of items 1 Association rule mining is an important area of data mining and has been widely applied in many fields 2  The association rule 3 is here understood as an expression 002 003 004 where 002 and 004 are Boolean attributes derived from columns of an analyzed data matrix\(that is object-attribute 2-dimension table\The intuitive meaning of the association rule 002 003 004 is that Boolean attributes 002 and 004 are associated in a way corresponding to the symbol   003 A constraint Logic based discrete network was developed to perform various tasks: to infer and to check properties from observations and to perform qualitative simulations 4 Observational calculi approved as a tool for study logical properties of association rules 5  The class of association rules with the F-property is introduced 6   The output of the these procedure is a list of all prime hypotheses. The hypothesis is prime if both it is true and it does not immedi ately follow from other output hypotheses The outline of this paper is putting out the back ground of the association ru les in Section 2; giving our main results of the transitive quantifiers in Section 3; then presenting several experiments to check the effect of those results in Section 4; at last getting conclusion and the future prospect in Section 5  2.The background to logic of association rules  The classical association rules of the form X 002 Y  where X and Y are sets of items, which meaning that the rule X 002 Y is that transactions \(e.g. supermarket baskets\ontaining set X of items tend to contain set Y  of items Two measures of intens ity of the association rule are used, confidence and support. The association rule discovery task is to find all association rules of the form X 002 Y such that the support and confidence of X  002 Y are above the user defined thresholds min sup and min conf respectively  We understand the association rule as the expression 002 002 and 004 where 003 004 are the Boolean attributes. The meaning of the association rule 002 002 and 004 is that the Boolean attributes 003 004  are associated in the way given by the symbol 003  which is called 4ft-quantifier It denotes a condition concerning a four-fold contingency table of 002 and 004  Various types of dependencies of 002 and 004 e.g implication or equivalence\can be expressed in this way The Boolean attributes 002 and 004 are derived from the basic Boolean attributes and from propositional connectives   and  in a usual way. The basic Boolean attribute is the expression of 005\006 007

The association rule     is verified on the basis of the four-fold table 4ft     M   and  in M see Table 1 Here a is the number of th e objects \(i.e. the rows of M  satisfying both  and  b is the number of the objects satisfying   and not satisfying  c is the number of objects not satisfying  and satisfying   and d is the number of objects satisfying neither   nor   Table 1 ft     M  M         a B    c D So writing 4ft     M a, b, c, d sometimes using the abbrevia tion ç4fté instead of the expression çfour-fold tabl eé. The notion 4ft table is used for all possible tables 4f t     M  Here we define that 4ft table is a quadruple <a, b, c d> of the integer non-negative numbers a, b, c, d such that a + b + c + d > 0. We write a, b, c, d\ 1, if the condition co rresponding to the 4ft quantifier   is satisfied for the quadruple <a, b, c, d>of integer nonnegative numbers; otherwise we write a, b, c, d 0. In addition we let r be a +b, k be a +c and n be a b + c + d, seeing Table 2   Table 2 ft table 4ft    M  M        a b r   c d k  n Extended by r, k and n.Vari ous kinds of depe ndencies of the Boolean attributes   and  can be expressed by suitable 4ft quantifiers, as following 3    The 4ft-quantifier of founded implication for 0 p 1 and Base 0 is defined by the condition Base p    b a a   p  a Base    The 4ft-quantifier of lower critical implication for 0 p 1 , 0    Base p 015  015 0.5and Base 0 is defined by the condition  i b a i b a a i p p i b a                1  015  a Base    The 4ft-quantifier Base p   of founded founded implication for 0 p 1 and Base 0 is defined by the condition c b a a    p a Base     The 4ft-quantifier of lower critical double implication for 0 p 1 , 0    Base p 015  015 0.5and Base 0 is defined by the condition  i c b a i c b a a i p p i c b a                   1  015  a Base    The 4ft-quantifier Base p   of founded equivalence  for 0 p 1 and Base 0 is defined by the condition n d a   p  a Base    The 4ft-quantifier of lower critical equivalence for 0 p 1 , 0    Base p 015  015 0.5and Base 0 is defined by the condition  i n i n a i p p i n             1  015  a Base

J. Rauch[9-1 discussed some classes of 4ft quantifiers such as implicational quantifiers double implicational quantifiers, equivalence quantifiers and  equivalence quantifiers The association rule     is one of the classes of implicational association rules if the 4ft quantifier  is one of the classes of implication quantifiers In this case we also say that the association rule     is implicational association rule and that the 4ft quantifier  is implicational quantifier. This is the same for additional classes of associatio n rules and so the others  Now we are going to suggest several other classes of 4ft quantifier ab out transitivity  We concentrate on transitive quantifiers \(Section 3.1\transitive quantifiers \(Section 3.2  double transitive quantifiers \(Section 3.3 founded-equivalent transitive quantifiers\(Section 3.4 because presented theoretical results concern these classes  3.1. Transitive Quantifiers  When we meet this situation that we have two association rues of    and    you will ask the question whether we have    so here we are going to give you the answer of this. At first we define this transitive prop erty of the 4ft-quantifier as such Definition 1 The 4ft quantifier  is  transitive  if   a, b, c, d\= 1  aê, bê, cê, dê\1  max a   a   a    b    min b  b  plies aêê, bêê, cêê, d 1, for all 4ft tables<a, b, c, d>, < aê, bê, cê, dê> and aêê, bêê, cêê, d  Now we have the following conclusion Proposition 1 The 4ft-quantifier of founded implication is transitive Base p   For the proofing we would show if  Base p    a, b, c, d\ 1   aê, bê, cê, d Base p    a    max a a    b    min b b plies   Base p    aêê, bêê, cêê, dêê\1. It is true following from a    max a a   b    min b b  b a a         b a a      p or b a a         b a a   p Remark 1 From the discussion above we know that the transitive qu antifiers is depend only the items of a and b in <a, b, c, d>, otherwise the items of c and d   3.2. Double Transitive Quantifiers

    Here we think about the more rigorously restricting of the transitive quantifiers and get the new one as such Definition 2 The 4ft quantifier  is  double transitive  if   a, b, c, d\1 aê, bê, cê, dê\1   max a  min b  min c, \implies  a   a   b   b   c   c   aêê, bêê, cêê, dêê\1 for all 4ft tables<a, b, c, d aê, bê, cê, d and < a bêê, cêê, d Several 4ft quantifiers are Double Transitive, for example Proposition 2 The 4ft-quantifier of double founded implication is transitive Base p   For the proofing we would show if  Base p    a, b, c, d\ 1   aê, bê, c d max a a  min b b   min c implies  Base p    a     b     c   c  Base p    aêê, bêê, cêê, dêê\= 1  It is true following from  max a  min b a   a  b   b   c b a a            c b a a        p or c b a a            c b a a    p  Remark 2 From the discussion above we know that the double transitive quan tifiers is depend only the items of a, b and c in <a, b, c, d>, otherwise the items of d  3.3 Double Transitive Quantifiers   For checking the transitivity of the 4f t quantifiers of  and we found that they all used the sum of a+b+c. So it resulted in the definition of the class of double transitive quantifiers Base p      Base p 015   Definition 3 The 4ft quantifier is double transitive  if   a, b, c, d\1 aê, bê, cê, dê\1   max a  min b+c c plies   a   a   b   c   b    aêê, bêê, cêê, dêê\1 for all 4ft tables<a, b, c, d aê, bê, cê, d and < a bêê, cêê, d So the 4ft quantifier Base p    of founded double implication is  double transitive, the proof is obvious from proposion 2. But the 4ft quantifier of lower critical double implication is also    Base p 015   double transitive, and now give the proofing Proposition 3 The 4ft-quantifier of lower critical double implication  for 0 p 1, 0    Base p 015  015 0.5 and Base 0 is defined by the condition  i c b a i c b a a i p p i c b a                   1  015  a Base  is  double transitive Proof What we have to do is to prove that if   i c b a i c b a a i p p i c b a                   1  015   i c b a i c b a a i p p i c b a                             1  015  and a    max a a    b    min b+c c   b   c   then also   i c b a i c b a a i p p i c b a                                       1  015  Noting that a    max a  k0, s.t. a bêê+cêê=a\(or a   a   b    c   k, according to Lemma 1 we have   i c b a i c b a a i p p i c b a                                       1   i c b a i c b a a i p p i c b a                               1  or  i c b a i c b a a i p p i c b a                                   1  And from the condition b  min b+c   c   b   c  o  t0, s.t. a\(or a   b    c   a+b+c+k\(or  a  b  c  k according to Lemma 2 we have   i c b a i c b a a i p p i c b a                               1  or  i c b a i c b a a i p p i c b a                                   1

Founded-equivalently Transitive Quantifiers  Corresponding to the 4ft-quantifier of founded equivalence and the 4ft-quantifier of lower critical equivalence, here give the definition of founded- equivalently transitive quantifiers Base p      Base p 015  Definition 4 The 4ft quantifier is founded equivalently transitive  if a, b, c, d\ = 1 aê, b cê, dê\1 a max a,a min b  b  min c, c d max d, d  implies aêê, bêê, cêê, dêê\1 for all 4ft tables<a, b, c, d aê, bê, cê, dê> and < aêê, bêê, cêê, d      Now to think about th e 4ft-quantifier and they are all founded-equivalently transitive the proofing like those propositions above Base p      Base p 015   4 Experiments  For checking the effects of the results discussed aboved, using of two synthesize data sets T10I4D100k and T25I10D10k\public data set\(Connect-4: http://miles.c nuce.cnr.it/~palmeri/data m/DCI/datasets.php\strong correlation.

And some experiments were taken out to valid ate TOSCU compared with OSCU. But some works need to do such as following   the hypothesis is prime if it is both true and it does not immediately follow from other output hypotheses   it need include the imbedding the rules notation using as interfusing there under   the efficiency of TOSCU for the large scale multi-relational data  Acknowledgements  This paper is supported by the University Science Technology Program of 211 Engineering, P.

Figure 1 Experiment Design used in our experiments in order to maintain the high stability as suggested by The topics ha v e title description and narrative However only the titles are used as queries because in real world users only use short phrases to express their information needs 4.1 Information Gathering System An information gathering system IGS is implemented for common use by all the experimental models The IGS is an implementation of a model developed by which uses user pro\002les for information gathering The s model is chosen because not only it is veri\002ed better than the Rocchio and Dempster-Shafer models but also it is extensible in using support values of training documents The input support values associated with documents would affect the IGS's performance sensitively The technical details and the related justi\002cations can be referred to The IGS 002rst uses the training set to evaluate weights for a set of selected terms T  After text pre-processing of stopword removal and word stemming a positive document d becomes a pattern that consists of a set of term frequency pairs  d  f  t 1  f 1    t 2  f 2        t k  f k  g  where f i is t i s term frequency in d  The semantic space referred by  d is represented by its normal form 014  d   which satis\002es 014  d   f  t 1  w 1    t 2  w 2        t k  w k  g  where w i  i  1      k  are the weight distribution of terms and w i  f i P k j 1 f j  A probability function on T can be derived based on the normal forms of positive documents and their supports for all t 2 T  pr 014  t   X d 2 D    t;w  2 014  d  support  d  002 w 12 The testing documents can be indexed by weight  d   which is calculated using the probability function pr 014  weight  d   X t 2 T pr 014  t  002 034  t d  13 where 034  t d   1 if t 2 d  otherwise 034  t d   0  4.2 TREC Model The TREC model is the implementation of a user's mental model For a given topic the TREC linguists read a set of documents and marked each document positive or negative against the topic If a document d is marked positive it becomes a positive document in the TREC training set and support  d   1 j D  j  otherwise it becomes a negative document and support  d   0  Since the linguists who marked the documents are also the people who generated the topics following the assumption that only users know their interests and preferences perfectly the TREC model makes a golden model to our proposed model to mark The modelling of a user's mental model can be proven successful if the ONTO model can achieve the same or close performance to this golden model 4.3 ONTO Model This model is the implementation of our proposed model As illustrated in Fig 1 and required by the IGS the input to this model is a topic and the output is a training set consisting of positive documents  D   and negative documents  D 000  Each document is associated with a support  d  value indicating its support level to the topic The WKB described in Section 3.3.1 is constructed based on the Library of Congress Subject Headings 2 LCSH system The LCSH system is a categorization developed for organizing the large volumes of library collections and for retrieving information from the library The subject headings in the LCSH are transformed into the subjects in WKB  and the LCSH structure is transformed into the backbone of WKB  Eventually the constructed WKB contains over 400,000 subjects covering various topics The semantic relations in the WKB are transformed from the references Broader term  Narrower term and Used-for  speci\002ed in the LCSH The Broader term and Narrower term references are transformed into hyponym/hypernym relations Used-for references are usually used in two situations to describe an action or to describe an object When object A is used for an action A actually becomes a part of that action like using turner in cooking when A is used for object B  A becomes a part of B  likeìusing wheels for a car Hence we transform the 2 http://classi\002cationweb.net

Used-for references in the LCSH into holonym/meronym relations in our WKB  In the experiments we assume that each topic comes from an individual user We attempt to evaluate our model in an environment that covers great range of topics However it is not realistic to expect a participant to hold such great range of topics in personal interests Thus for the 50 experimental topics we assume each one coming from an individual user and learn her his personalized ontology An LIR is collected through searching the subject catalogue of Queensland University of Technology QUT Library 3 by using the title of a topic Librarians have assigned title table of content summary and a list of subjects to each information item e.g a book stored in QUT library The assigned subjects are treated as the tags in Web documents that cite the knowledge in the WKB  In order to simplify the experiments we only use the librarian summarized information title table of content and summary to represent an instance in an LIR  All these information can be downloaded from QUT's Web site and are available to the public Once the WKB and an LIR are ready an ontology is learned as described in Section 3.3.1 and personalized as in Section 3.3.2 The user con\002dence rates on the subjects are speci\002ed as in Section 3.3.3 A document d i in the training set is then generated by an instance i  and its support value is determined by support  d i   X s 2 021  i  s 2S sup  s Q  14 where s 2 S in O  Q  are as de\002ned in De\002nition 5 As sup  s Q   0 for s 2 S 000 according to Eq 11 the documents with support  d   0 go to D 000  whereas those with support  d   0 go to D   4.4 Performance Measures The performance of the experimental models are measured by three methods the precision averages at eleven standard recall levels 11SPR the mean average precision MAP and the F 1 Measure They are all based on precision and recall the modern IR evaluation methods The 11SPR is reported suitable for information gathering and is used in TREC evaluations as a performance measuring standard An 11SPR v alue is computed by summing the interpolated precisions at the speci\002ed recall cutoff and then dividing by the number of topics P N i 1 precision 025 N  025  f 0  0  0  1  0  2      1  0 g  15 N is the number of topics and 025 are the cutoff points where the precisions are interpolated At each 025 point an aver3 http://library.qut.edu.au Figure 2 Experimental 11SPR Results age precision value over N topics is calculated These average precisions then link to a curve describing the recallprecision performance The MAP is a stable and discriminating choice in information gathering evaluations and is recommended for measuring general-purpose information gathering methods The average precision for each topic is the mean of the precision obtained after each relevant document is retrieved The MAP for the 50 experimental topics is then the mean of the average precision scores of each of the individual topics in the experiments The MAP re\003ects the performance in a non-interpolated recall-precision fashion F 1 Measure is also well accepted by the information gathering community which is calculated by F 1  2 002 precision 002 recall precision  recall  16 Precision and recall are evenly weighted in F 1 Measure For each topic the macro F 1 Measure averages the precision and recall and then calculates F 1 Measure whereas the micro F 1 Measure calculates the F 1 Measure for each returned result and then averages the F 1 Measure values The greater F 1 values indicate the better performance 5 Results and Discussions The experiments attempt to evaluate our proposed model by comparing to an implementation of mental model We expect that the ONTO model can achieve at least the close performance to the TREC model The experimental 11SPR results are illustrated in Fig 2 At recall point 0.3 the TREC model slightly outperformed the ONTO model but at 0.5 and 0.6 the ONTO model achieved better results than the TREC model subtly At all other points their 11SPR results are just the same For the MAP results shown on Table 1 the ONTO model achieved 0.284 which is just 0.006 below the TREC model 2

TREC ONTO p-value Macro-FM 0.388 0.386 0.862 Micro-FM 0.356 0.355 0.896 MAP 0.290 0.284 0.484 Table 1 Other Experimental results downgrade For the average macroand microF 1 Measures also shown on Table 1 the TREC model only outperformed the ONTO model by 0.002 0.5 in macro F 1 and 0.001 0.2 in micro F 1  The two models achieved almost the same performance The evaluation result is promising The statistical test is also performed on the experimental results in order to analyze the evaluation's reliability As suggested by we use the Student's Paired T-Test for the signi\002cance test The null hypothesis in our T-Test is that no difference exists in two comparing models When two tests produce substantially low p-value usually  0.05 the null hypothesis can be rejected In contrast when two tests produce high p-value usually  0.1 there is not or just little practical difference between two models The T-Test results are also presented on Table 1 The pvalue s show that there is no evidence of signi\002cant difference between two experimental models as the produced pvalue s are quite high  p-value 0.484\(MAP 0.862\(macroFM and 0.896\(micro-FM far greater than 0.1 Thus we can conclude that in terms of statistics our proposed model has the same performance as the golden TREC model and the evaluation result is reliable The advantage of the TREC model is that the experimental topics and the training sets are generated by the same linguists manually They as users perfectly know their information needs and what they are looking for in the training sets Therefore it is reasonable that the TREC model performed better than the ONTO model as we cannot expect that a computational model could outperform a such perfect manual model However the knowledge contained in TREC model's training sets is well formed for human beings to understand but not for computers The contained knowledge is not mathematically formalized and speci\002ed The ONTO model on the other hand formally speci\002es the user background knowledge and the related semantic relations using the world knowledge base and local instance repositories The mathematic formalizations are ideal for computers to understand This leverages the performance of the ONTO model As a result as shown on Fig 2 and Table 1 the ONTO model achieved almost the same performance as that of the TREC model 6 Conclusions In this paper an ontology-based knowledge IR framework is proposed aiming to discover a user's background knowledge to improve IR performance The framework consists of a user's mental model a querying model a computer model and an ontology model A world knowledge base is used by the computer model to construct an ontology to simulate a user's mental model and the ontology is personalized by using the user's local instance repository The semantic relations of hypernym/hyponym holonym/meronym and synonym are speci\002ed in the ontology model The framework is successfully evaluated by comparing to a manual user model The ontology-based framework is a novel contribution to knowledge engineering and Web information retrieval References   C Buckley and E M Voorhees Evaluating evaluation measure

support pruning gene expression classifier with an accurate and compact fuzzy rule base for microarray data analysis Biosystems vol 85 computationally challenging As training set sizes increase it is likely that these difficulties will also increase VI RELATED WORK While operating on a microarray dataset current CAR 1 2 3 4 and other pattern/rule 20 21 mining algorithms perform a pruned and/or compacted exponential search over either the space of gene subsets or the space of sample subsets Hence they are generally quite computationally expensive for datasets containing many training samples or genes as the case may be BSTC is explicitly related to CAR-based classifiers but requires no expensive CAR mining BSTC is also related to decision tree-based classifiers such as random forest 19 and C4.5 family 9 methods It is possible to represent any consistent set of boolean association rules as a decision tree and vice versa However it is generally unclear how the trees generated by current tree-based classifiers are related to high confidence/support CARs which are known to be particularly useful for microarray data 1 2 6 7 11 BSTC is explicitly related to and motivated by CAR-based methods To the best of our knowledge there is no previous work on mining/classifying with BARs of the form we consider here Perhaps the work closest to utilizing 100 BARs is the TOPRULES 22 miner TOP-RULES utilizes a data partitioning technique to compactly report itemlgene subsets which are unique to each class set Ci Hence TOP-RULES discovers all 100 confident CARs in a dataset However the method must utilize an emerging pattern mining algorithm such as MBD-LLBORDER 23 and so generally isn't polynomial time Also related to our BAR-based techniques are recent methods which mine gene expression training data for sets of fuzzy rules 24 25 Once obtained fuzzy rules can be used for classification in a manner analogous to CARs However the resulting fuzzy classifiers don't appear to be as accurate as standard classification methods such as SVM 25 VII CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK To address the computational difficulties involved with preclassification CAR mining see Tables IV and VI we developed a novel method which considers a larger subset of CAR-related boolean association rules BARs These rules can be compactly captured in a Boolean Structure Table BST which can then be used to produce a BST classifier called BSTC Comparison to the current leading CAR classifier RCBT on several benchmark microarray datasets shows that BSTC is competitive with RCBT's accuracy while avoiding the exponential costs incurred by CAR mining see Section VB Hence BSTC extends generalized CAR based methods to larger datasets then previously practical Furthermore unlike other association rule-based classifiers BSTC easily generalizes to multi-class gene expression datasets BSTC's worst case per-query classification time is worse then CAR-based methods after all exponential time CAR mining is completed O SlS CGl versus O Si CGi As future work we plan on investigating techniques to decrease this cost by carefully culling BST exclusion lists ACKNOWLEDGM[ENTS We thank Anthony K.H
